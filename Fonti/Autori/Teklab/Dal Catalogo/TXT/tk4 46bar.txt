TK4 @46 bar 
14
Oil Level Regulator with integrated connectivity capabilities 
CONNECTORS VERSION 
TWO MOUNTING POSSIBILITIES WITH THE SAME PRODUCT (LEFT/RIGHT) 
Some advantages of this solution: 
• Extremely compact dimensions  
• Left/Right mounting possibility with the same TK4 • Reduction of the number of junctions in the circuit with less possibility of having leakages 
• Usageof lesscomponents(simplified circuit and easier warehouse management) 
• Simplified Installation (cost savings in terms of installation time) • Revolutionary connectivity capabilities. 
Main Features 
• High reliability ensured by absence of mechanical moving parts. 
• Sight glass and electronic LEDs can be checked on the same side  where is more comfortable to do inspections. 
• Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology with absence of seals ensures no leakage and good chemical compatibility. 
• Direct sight glass replacement (3/4/6 holes flange connection).  • 24 VAC / 230 VAC power supply options.

Integrated filtering element in series  
with the valve. 
Please contact Teklab for more info. 
• Easy maintenance of the coil of the valve and of the Electro Optic sensor that can be easily replaced without emptying or depressurizing the plant. 
• 230 VAC /2A alarm relay output suitable for direct connection in  the security chain of the system. 
• Adapters suitable for various types of compressors. • Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and 2014/35/UE. 
HIGH PRESSURE OIL RETURN LINE SYSTEM EXAMPLE 
The TK4 is designed to control the oil level in the compressor  crankcase in order to avoid the compressor to run without oil and so  improve its lifetime. TK4 monitors the oil level with the embedded  electro-optic sensor and comprises a solenoid valve for oil filling  and a relay output contact to give an alarm.
