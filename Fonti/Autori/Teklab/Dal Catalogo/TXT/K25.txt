K25 Level Switch for High Pressure environments 
46
with 4÷20 mA analog temperature output up to 150 bar SUITABLE FOR CO2 SYSTEMS 
Application Description 
The optical level switch has been designed for use in level monitoring  
applications for the control of oil or liquid CO2 for transcritical or  
subcritical applications.  
The switch has no moving parts, thus it is particularly suited for  
monitoring critical media where high reliability is needed. 
The sensor provides two outputs:  
• the first one – digital – indicates if the liquid is present or absent, 
• the second one – analogical – is proportional to the temperature 
read. 
It combines the Level Detection and the Temperature Management  
with the high pressure resistance up to 150 Bar. 
Operating Principle 
  
  

The sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.
