TK4MB @80 bar 
Oil Level Regulator with integrated Modbus RTU connectivity 
  
  

Integrated filtering element in series  
with the valve. 
Please contact Teklab for more info. 
Some advantages of this solution: 
• Modbus RTU Serial connection to system controller • Extremely compact dimensions  
• Left/Right mounting possibility with the same TK4-MB • Reduction of the number of junctions in the circuit with less possibility of having leakages 
Main Features 
• High reliability ensured by absence of mechanical moving parts. 
• Sight glass and electronic LEDs can be checked on the same side  where is more comfortable to do inspections. 
• Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology with absence of seals ensures no leakage and good chemical compatibility. 
• Direct sight glass replacement (3/4/6 holes flange connection).  • 24 VAC / 230 VAC power supply options. 
Application Description 
• Usageof lesscomponents(simplified circuit and easier warehouse management) 
• Simplified Installation (cost savings in terms of installation time) • Revolutionary connectivity capabilities. 
• Easy maintenance of the coil of the valve and of the Electro Optic sensor that can be easily replaced without emptying or depressurizing the plant. 
• 230 VAC /2A alarm relay output suitable for direct connection in  the security chain of the system. 
• Adapters suitable for various types of compressors. • Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and 2014/35/UE. 
HIGH PRESSURE OIL RETURN LINE SYSTEM EXAMPLE 
The TK4-MB is designed to control the oil level in the compressor  crankcase in order to avoid the compressor to run without oil and  so improve its lifetime. TK4-MB monitors the oil level with the  embedded electro-optic sensor and comprises a solenoid valve for  oil filling and a relay output contact to give an alarm.
