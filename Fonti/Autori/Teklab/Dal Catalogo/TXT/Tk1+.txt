Level Control Unit TK1+ 34
Application Description 
SUITABLE FOR CO2 SYSTEMS 
Main Features 
• The absence of mechanical moving parts ensures High reliability • 24VAC / 230VAC power supply options 
• Easy installation (sight-glass replacement) 
• Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology ensures no  leakage and good chemical compatibility 
• Electronic sensor can be easily replaced without emptying and/or depressurizing the plant due to the two parts design • Direct mounting possibility / adapters suitable for various types of compressors 
• Customizable delays on request 
• Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and 2014/35/UE. 
TK1+ series is especially designed for use in level monitoring for HVAC&R market.  
TK1+ can be mounted directly on the crankcase of the compressor, on the oil reservoir, oil separator or liquid receiver. This product is very reliable and suitable for working in heavy environments. 
LEDs integrated in the electronic module allow to verify the liquid status. 
The two parts design allows the fast replacement of the electronic parts without depressurizing the system. 
  
  
The electronic module of the TK1+ contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted  is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the liquid and the sensor senses its presence.
