Safety notes 
The sensor has been designed and manufactured to achieve the ia intrinsically safety, and to work in potential explosive environment – IIC Group. Regarding the temperature class of the instrument, please look at the table on next page of this document for more details. 
Operating Principle 
  
  

The sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.
