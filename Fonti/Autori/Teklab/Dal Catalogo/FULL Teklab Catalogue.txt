Main Features 
TK4 combines the established reliability and ease of installation of  TK3 and TK3+ with revolutionary connectivity capabilities which  opens new and interesting usage scenarios for the product. TK4 in fact integrates a wireless near field communication protocol that allows users to interact with the oil level regulator to expand  product’s features. 
The communication technology adopted is: 
• Extremely easy-to-use: data accessible without disassembling  enclosures and connecting cables. 
• Powered / not powered operating: several information accessible  also when the electronics is not powered (useful for quick and  easy in-house customization). 
• Highly compact and cost effective: the product keeps its very  compact design and there is no need for expensive devices. • Highly safe: password protected point to point single link with  limited range of operation to avoid unwanted changes from  unauthorized personnel. 
• Really Flexible: possibility of modifying functioning parameters  and verify working conditions (also in real time) to optimize  system’s operation. 
• Open for the future: Teklab is continuously in contact with  customers for adding features to the product. 
Typical applications are: 
• verification of product operation status and system operating conditions during  normal maintenance operations.

TK4MB 
10
Enhanced Oil Level Regulator 
with integrated Modbus RTU Connectivity Main Features 
TK4-MB combines the established reliability and ease of installation  of TK3+ with revolutionary flexibility of standard TK4 extending  its connectivity capabilities through the introduction of wired serial  interface based on Modbus RTU protocol.  
TK4-MB in fact integrates two possibilities of communication interface: • A wired serial interface based on Modbus RTU protocol. • A wireless near field communication protocol that allows users to  interact easily and directly with the oil level regulator using a Windows  based PC or an Android device (Mobile Phone or Tablet). 
The TK4-MB is designed to be connected to widely diffused Modbus  RTU networks as a slave node opening the possibility of having the  availability of info about working conditions of the product and thus  of the system. Consequently it is possible to have remote monitoring  of the compressor pack even further reliable and effective letting it  possible to optimize systems performances, to prevent and manage  alarms and to elaborate accurate maintenance plans. 
Here is an example of typical connection: 
  

Reading and Writing Register Commands are processed according to  standard Modbus RTU protocol (www.modbus.org) to allow easy inte gration and maximum flexibility. 
Example of parameters accessible on the serial bus are: Valve and  Alarm contact status, Functioning Timings, Time to Alarm, Logging  info, etc. 
11  
The wireless proximity communication with the TK4 is established simply connecting the supplied USB  
dongle to the PC or to the Android device (Tablet or Smartphone) and launching the dedicated App. 
This solution is:  
•  Extremely easy-to-use: data accessible without disassembling enclosures and connecting cables. 
•  Powered / not powered operating: several information accessible also when the electronics is not 
powered (useful for quick and easy in-house customization).  
•   Highly compact and cost effective: the product keeps its very compact design and there is no need 
for expensive devices.  
•  Highly safe: password protected point to point single link with limited range of operation to avoid 
unwanted changes from unauthorized personnel.  
•  Really Flexible: possibility of modifying functioning parameters and verify working conditions (also 
in real time) to optimize system’s operation.  
•  Open for the future: Teklab is continuously in contact with 
customers for adding features to the product.   
It can be used for direct customization of working parameters and working serial settings of the Modbus protocol (like Device Address, baud  rate, etc) letting it very easy to integrate the product on any system.  
  
  

  

Typical applications are: 
• verification of product operation status and system operating conditions from  remote control rooms (using Modbus  interface).  
• verification of product operation status and system operating conditions during  normal maintenance operations directly  on the unit without the needing of any  connection (using wireless interface). 
• functioning timings customization for system’s optimization. 
• alarm timings customization for better system’s monitoring.

LEVEL SWITCHES
Level Control Unit TK1+ 34
Application Description 
SUITABLE FOR CO2 SYSTEMS 
Main Features 
• The absence of mechanical moving parts ensures High reliability • 24VAC / 230VAC power supply options 
• Easy installation (sight-glass replacement) 
• Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology ensures no  leakage and good chemical compatibility 
• Electronic sensor can be easily replaced without emptying and/or depressurizing the plant due to the two parts design • Direct mounting possibility / adapters suitable for various types of compressors 
• Customizable delays on request 
• Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and 2014/35/UE. 
TK1+ series is especially designed for use in level monitoring for HVAC&R market.  
TK1+ can be mounted directly on the crankcase of the compressor, on the oil reservoir, oil separator or liquid receiver. This product is very reliable and suitable for working in heavy environments. 
LEDs integrated in the electronic module allow to verify the liquid status. 
The two parts design allows the fast replacement of the electronic parts without depressurizing the system. 
The electronic module of the TK1+ contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted  is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the liquid and the sensor senses its presence.

Application Description 
SUITABLE FOR CO2 SYSTEMS 
Main Features 
• The absence of mechanical moving parts ensures High reliability  
• Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology  ensures no leakage and good chemical compati bility 
• Electronic sensor can be easily replaced without  emptying and/or depressurizing the plant due to the two parts design 
• No need for calibrations on the field 
• Direct mounting onto various types of compressors  (M20x1.5 or 1”1/8 – 18 UNEF adapter) and tanks (1/2”NPT adapter), etc... 
• Customizable delays on request 
• Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and  2014/35/UE. 
The optical level switch has been designed for use in level monitoring applications for the control of low viscosity liquids. It comprises an optical sensor and an output switch. It is realized in two parts to let it possible to replace the electronics without the needing  of emptying or depressurizing the plant. 
The sensor is suitable as minimum or maximum alarm. 
Delays can be introduced in order to satisfy particular needing or avoid false alarms. 
Operating Principle 

The sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.

SENSORS
K25 Level Switch for High Pressure environments 
46
with 4÷20 mA analog temperature output up to 150 bar SUITABLE FOR CO2 SYSTEMS 
Application Description 
The optical level switch has been designed for use in level monitoring  
applications for the control of oil or liquid CO2 for transcritical or  
subcritical applications.  
The switch has no moving parts, thus it is particularly suited for  
monitoring critical media where high reliability is needed. 
The sensor provides two outputs:  
• the first one – digital – indicates if the liquid is present or absent, 
• the second one – analogical – is proportional to the temperature 
read. 
It combines the Level Detection and the Temperature Management  
with the high pressure resistance up to 150 Bar. 
Operating Principle 

The sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.

K11 Level Switch 50Operating Principle 
Application Description 
K11 level switches are suitable for high pressure applications like  pressurized vessels, HVAC and refrigeration, motors etc. They have  bodies made of stainless steel and sensor dome made of glass.  They are economical, dependable, and compact in size with overall  dimensions of 59 x 27 mm and have no moving parts.  These level switches use infrared technology for their operation.  They have an operating temperature range of -40°C to 125°C.  There is a programmable timer inside these K11 level switches that  allows a delay time to be set for delaying the output switching.  The output modes are closed in presence of liquids and open in air or  vice versa.  
The AC / DC output current is up to 100mA depending on model. These level switches can integrate electronic protections against  transient over voltage, and reverse polarity (for DC models). They can withstand maximum pressure of 60 bar.  

The sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.
