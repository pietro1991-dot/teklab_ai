      "question": "What's the difference between a level sensor and a level controller?",
      "answer": "**Level Sensor** (like LC series): Detects liquid presence and provides output signal (relay, 4-20mA) for monitoring only. You decide what action to take based on the signal.\n\n**Level Controller** (like TK3+, TK4): Detects liquid level AND can automatically control it by activating solenoid valves for automatic filling. Provides both monitoring and control.\n\nExample: TK1+ is technically a sensor (monitoring only), while TK3+/TK4 are controllers (monitoring + automatic oil filling).\n\nFor compressor oil management: Controllers (TK3+/TK4) are preferred as they can automatically maintain oil level without manual intervention.",

      "answer": "**It depends on the pressure rating!**\n\nR134a systems typically operate at ~12-15 bar condensing pressure → 46 bar sensor sufficient.\n\nR410A systems operate at ~25-28 bar condensing pressure → **80 bar sensor REQUIRED**.\n\n**If you currently have 46 bar sensor for R134a:**\n❌ It will FAIL if used with R410A (pressure too high)\n✅ You MUST upgrade to 80 bar version\n\n**Good news:** The IR sensor technology is compatible with both refrigerants. Only the pressure rating changes.\n\n**Recommendation:** If you know you'll upgrade refrigerant in the future, install 80 bar sensor from the start (minimal cost difference, future-proof).",

      "answer": "**Yes, Teklab IR sensors work at any angle** - top, side, or bottom mounted.\n\nHowever, **vertical or near-vertical (up to 45°) is recommended** for oil applications to prevent foam accumulation around the sensor dome.\n\n**Mounting angle considerations:**\n✅ **0-45° from vertical**: Optimal for all applications\n✅ **45-90° (horizontal)**: Works fine for clean liquids (water, refrigerant)\n⚠️ **Near-horizontal for oil**: May need longer timer delay to filter foam\n\n**Advantage over float switches:**\nMechanical floats MUST be vertical (need vertical travel space). Teklab IR sensors offer much more mounting flexibility.\n\n**Installation tip:**\nIf you must mount horizontally for oil applications, increase programmable timer to 7-10 seconds to compensate for foam accumulation.",

      "question": "The sensor worked fine for years, now suddenly giving false alarms. What changed?",
      "answer": "If a sensor worked reliably for years and suddenly has issues, **something in the system changed** - the sensor itself is very unlikely to have failed.\n\n**Common causes of sudden false alarms:**\n\n1. **Oil condition deteriorated**\n   - Refrigerant contamination causing excessive foaming\n   - Wrong oil added during service\n   - Oil breakdown after years of operation\n   - **Solution:** Oil analysis, replace if contaminated\n\n2. **System changes**\n   - New refrigerant charge affecting oil behavior\n   - Compressor wear increasing vibration\n   - Recent service work disturbed sensor mounting\n   - **Solution:** Check what maintenance was done recently\n\n3. **Environmental changes**\n   - Higher ambient temperatures → more foaming\n   - Increased system load → different oil behavior\n   - **Solution:** Increase timer delay to adapt\n\n4. **Dome fouling (rare after years, but possible)**\n   - Oil varnish buildup after extended operation\n   - **Solution:** Clean sensor dome\n\n**Troubleshooting steps:**\n1. Inspect oil condition (foamy? contaminated?)\n2. Increase programmable timer delay (quick test)\n3. Check what system maintenance occurred recently\n4. Clean sensor dome as preventive measure\n5. Verify sensor mounting still secure\n\n**Key point:** After 10+ years of reliable operation, sudden issues almost always point to system changes, not sensor failure. Teklab IR sensors are extremely robust.",

      "question": "What happens if oil gets on the sensor dome? Does it stop working?",
      "answer": "**Oil on the dome actually helps detection!**\n\nThe sensor works by detecting the **change in light refraction** when liquid contacts the dome. Oil film on the dome doesn't interfere - the sensor still detects when immersed in oil vs exposed to air.\n\n**What CAN cause issues (rare):**\n\n1. **Heavy oil varnish buildup** after many years\n   - Thick coating can trap air bubbles\n   - Creates false \"air\" reading\n   - **Solution:** Clean dome with isopropyl alcohol (5 minutes, back to perfect)\n\n2. **Oil residue with embedded dirt/particles**\n   - Can scatter IR light unpredictably\n   - **Solution:** Clean with refrigeration-safe solvent\n\n**Preventive maintenance:**\n- Inspect dome annually during service\n- Clean if visible residue/varnish (rare)\n- Takes 5 minutes, sensor works like new\n\n**vs Mechanical floats:**\nFloats FAIL when oil residue causes sticking. Teklab IR sensors just need occasional cleaning - much simpler and more reliable.\n\n**Practical answer:** Oil on dome is normal and fine. Only thick varnish buildup after YEARS needs cleaning, which is quick and easy.",

      "answer": "**Relay chattering = programmable timer delay is TOO SHORT for your oil conditions.**\n\n**Root cause:**\nSensor detecting rapid air/oil transitions (foam, turbulence, vibration) and relay responding immediately without filtering.\n\n**Solution: Increase programmable timer delay**\n\n**Step-by-step fix:**\n\n1. **Locate timer adjustment**\n   - Potentiometer on sensor housing, OR\n   - DIP switches (model-dependent)\n   - Consult sensor manual for location\n\n2. **Current setting vs recommended:**\n   - If currently 1-3 seconds → increase to 5-7 seconds\n   - If currently 5 seconds → increase to 8-10 seconds\n   - Start conservative, can adjust further if needed\n\n3. **Test and fine-tune:**\n   - Observe operation during compressor run\n   - Relay should switch smoothly, no rapid cycling\n   - If still chattering, increase delay further\n\n4. **Verify oil condition:**\n   - Excessive foam = oil may be contaminated\n   - Wrong oil type = change to correct refrigeration oil\n   - Refrigerant contamination = oil analysis recommended\n\n**Why this works:**\nTimer delay requires sensor to detect consistent air or oil for X seconds before changing relay state. Filters momentary fluctuations.\n\n**Typical settings:**\n- Clean oil, no foam: 3-5 seconds\n- Normal refrigeration oil: 5-7 seconds\n- Foamy or turbulent oil: 8-10 seconds\n- Extreme foam: 10-15 seconds (investigate oil quality)\n\n**If increasing timer doesn't fix:**\n- Check sensor mounting (vibration?)\n- Inspect oil for contamination\n- Verify dome is clean\n- Check electrical connections\n\n**Bottom line:** 95% of chattering fixed by increasing timer delay to 7-10 seconds.

      "question": "Sensor worked fine in summer, now false alarms in winter. Why?",
      "answer": "**Seasonal false alarms indicate temperature-related oil behavior changes, not sensor failure.**\n\n**Why winter causes issues:**\n\n**1. Oil viscosity increases (colder ambient)**\n- Thicker oil → slower drainage back to compressor\n- More foam formation when agitated\n- Bubbles persist longer in cold oil\n- **Result:** Sensor detects foam/bubbles = false LOW alarm\n\n**2. Refrigerant migration (lower ambient)**\n- Refrigerant condenses in cooler compressor\n- Dilutes oil, changes surface characteristics\n- Creates foam when system starts\n- **Result:** Transient false alarms during startup\n\n**3. Oil foaming during startup (cold oil)**\n- Cold, thick oil + system vibration = foam\n- Takes longer to settle than in summer\n- **Result:** Alarms during first 5-10 minutes of operation\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n✅ **Increase programmable timer delay**\n- Summer setting (5 sec) → Winter setting (8-10 sec)\n- Allows foam to dissipate before triggering alarm\n- Adjust seasonally or set conservative (10 sec year-round)\n\n✅ **Add startup delay logic (if PLC-controlled)**\n- Ignore alarms for first 10 minutes after compressor start\n- Allows oil to warm up and degas refrigerant\n- Only valid alarms after system stabilizes\n\n✅ **Check oil heater operation (if equipped)**\n- Crankcase heater prevents refrigerant migration\n- Verify heater working during off-cycles\n- Warm oil = less foam\n\n✅ **Verify oil type/specification**\n- Wrong oil viscosity for climate\n- Oil degraded, needs replacement\n- Refrigerant-contaminated oil\n\n**Preventive approach:**\n\n**If you experience seasonal issues:**\n1. Adjust timer delay to **8-10 seconds** (winter setting)\n2. Leave at 8-10 sec year-round (works in all seasons)\n3. Add startup delay logic if PLC-controlled\n4. Check oil condition if very old (replace if degraded)\n\n**vs Mechanical floats:**\nFloats also affected by oil viscosity changes, but fail completely (stick) rather than false alarm. Teklab just needs timer adjustment.\n\n**Key insight:** \nTeklab IR sensor is detecting REAL changes in oil behavior (foam, viscosity). It's not \"false\" alarm in technical sense - oil surface IS fluctuating. Timer delay filters this normal variation.\n\n**Bottom line:** Seasonal false alarms = increase timer delay to 8-10 seconds for winter operation. One-time adjustment, problem solved.",

      "question": "Temperature reading seems wrong (10-15°C off). How to fix?",
      "answer": "**Temperature reading errors are usually calibration or environmental issues, not sensor failure.**\n\n**Common causes:**\n\n**1. Sensor measuring oil temperature, not refrigerant (most common)**\n- Temperature sensor in sensor body (not separate probe)\n- Reads temperature of sensor housing\n- Influenced by ambient, compressor heat, oil temperature\n- **This is normal behavior, not a fault**\n\n**What user expects:** Refrigerant temperature\n**What sensor reads:** Oil/housing temperature\n**Difference:** Can be 10-15°C depending on conditions\n\n**2. Ambient temperature influence**\n- Sensor exposed to sun, hot engine room, cold outdoor\n- Housing temperature ≠ actual oil temperature\n- **Solution:** Shield sensor from direct heat/cold sources\n\n**3. Calibration offset needed**\n- Factory calibration ±2-3°C typical\n- If exact accuracy critical, calibration offset needed\n- **Solution:** Apply offset in PLC/SCADA or via MODBUS\n\n**4. Damaged temperature sensor (rare)**\n- Physical damage during installation\n- Water ingress (if not sealed properly)\n- **Solution:** Replace sensor (warranty if defective)\n\n**Troubleshooting steps:**\n\n**Step 1: Verify what temperature sensor measures**\n- Check TK4 manual: oil temperature vs housing temperature\n- If housing temperature: 10-15°C error is NORMAL\n- Sensor working correctly, just not measuring what you expect\n\n**Step 2: Compare to reference thermometer**\n- Use calibrated thermometer on compressor housing\n- Compare to sensor reading\n- Difference > 5°C = potential issue\n- Difference < 5°C = sensor working fine\n\n**Step 3: Apply calibration offset**\n\nIf sensor consistently reads +12°C high:\n\n**Via MODBUS (TK4 MODBUS):**\n- Write to calibration register (consult manual)\n- Apply -12°C offset\n- Sensor reading corrected\n\n**Via PLC/SCADA:**\n- Read raw temperature value\n- Subtract 12°C in PLC logic\n- Display corrected value\n\n**Via manual note:**\n- \"Sensor reads +12°C high, subtract 12 for actual temp\"\n- Simple compensation\n\n**Step 4: Check for environmental factors**\n- Sensor in direct sunlight? → shade it\n- Near hot exhaust? → relocate or insulate\n- In freezing outdoor? → verify within -40 to +125°C range\n\n**When to contact Teklab support:**\n\n⚠️ Temperature reading changes suddenly (was accurate, now wrong)\n⚠️ Reading completely nonsensical (200°C or -100°C)\n⚠️ Temperature reading fluctuates wildly\n⚠️ Recent physical damage to sensor\n\n**Important context:**\n\n**TK4 temperature monitoring purpose:**\n- **Trend monitoring** (is temp rising over time?)\n- **Alarm if excessive** (compressor overheating)\n- **NOT precision thermometry** (±5°C acceptable for these purposes)\n\nIf you need ±1°C accuracy:\n- Use dedicated precision temperature probe\n- TK4 temperature is \"bonus feature,\" not lab-grade measurement\n\n**Workaround for oil temperature:**\n\nIf you need accurate oil temperature (not housing temp):\n- Install **separate thermowell** in oil reservoir\n- Use dedicated temperature probe\n- TK4 temp = supplementary data\n\n**Bottom line:** \n- Verify sensor measures housing temp (not oil directly)\n- 10-15°C offset from expected is often normal\n- Apply calibration offset in PLC or via MODBUS\n- For precision: use dedicated temperature probe\n- TK4 temp monitoring = trend/alarm, not precision measurement",
