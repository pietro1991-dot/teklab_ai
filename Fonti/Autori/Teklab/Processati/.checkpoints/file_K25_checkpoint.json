      "original_text": "﻿K25 Level Switch for High Pressure environments \n46\nwith 4÷20 mA analog temperature output up to 150 bar SUITABLE FOR CO2 SYSTEMS \nApplication Description \nThe optical level switch has been designed for use in level monitoring  \napplications for the control of oil or liquid CO2 for transcritical or  \nsubcritical applications.  \nThe switch has no moving parts, thus it is particularly suited for  \nmonitoring critical media where high reliability is needed. \nThe sensor provides two outputs:  \n• the first one – digital – indicates if the liquid is present or absent, \n• the second one – analogical – is proportional to the temperature \nread. \nIt combines the Level Detection and the Temperature Management  \nwith the high pressure resistance up to 150 Bar. \nOperating Principle\n\nThe sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.  \nTechnical Data \n47\nOPERATION MODE \n\tDetect liquid presence with contact\n\tREPEATABILITY \n\t± 2 mm. \n\tBODY MATERIALS \n\tNickel plated steel\n\tSENSIBLE DOME \n\tGlass\n\tELECTRONIC PROTECTIONS \n\tTransient over voltage, reverse polarity\n\tMAX.
