      "content": "Technical context:\n\nInfrared Electro-Optic Level Detection Technology\n\nPrinciple of operation:\n• When only air is present in the sensing area, all infrared light emitted is reflected internally by the dome of the probe and returned to the receiver\n• When liquid is present, a large amount of IR rays emitted is absorbed/refracted by the liquid\n• As the amount of rays picked up by the receiver reduces when liquid is present, the IR sensor detects the presence of liquid\n\nKey characteristics:\n• Response time: Almost instantaneous\n• Detection accuracy: ±2mm\n• Mounting flexibility: Any angle - top, side, or bottom fitted\n• Liquid compatibility: Water, oil, CO2, and other refrigerants\n• Durability: Withstands extreme temperatures, pressures, vibrations, and shocks\n• Output types: Relay, 4-20mA, MODBUS RTU\n• Temperature range: -40°C to +125°C\n• No calibration required\n• Not affected by liquid hardness or conductivity\n• Works with clear, translucent, reflective, and opaque liquids\n• Programmable timer for transient filtering (waves, bubbles, foam)\n\n---\n\nQuestion: How does Teklab's infrared sensor technology work, and why is it better than traditional float switches or capacitive sensors?\n\nRespond as Teklab technical sales expert:\n- Explain the technology in accessible terms\n- Highlight competitive advantages\n- Provide practical benefits for customers"

      "content": "Teklab's infrared (IR) electro-optic sensors detect liquid levels using light refraction - a completely different approach than mechanical or capacitive technologies.\n\n**How it works (simple explanation):**\n\nThe sensor has a small dome at the tip that emits infrared light. When air surrounds the dome, the light reflects internally back to a receiver - like looking into a mirror. When liquid touches the dome, the light refracts (bends) into the liquid and doesn't return to the receiver. This change in received light signals liquid presence.\n\nThink of it like a prism: air reflects light, liquid bends it away. The sensor detects this change instantaneously (±2mm accuracy).\n\n**vs Mechanical Float Switches:**\n\n✅ **Reliability**: No moving parts = no wear, no sticking, no mechanical failure\n✅ **Lifespan**: Typical float life 2-3 years, IR sensors last 10+ years\n✅ **Maintenance**: Floats require regular cleaning and adjustment, IR sensors don't\n✅ **Accuracy**: Floats ±10-20mm, IR ±2mm\n❌ **Float problems**: Stick due to oil residue, fail in high vibration, break in harsh conditions\n\n**vs Capacitive Sensors:**\n\n✅ **Universal**: IR works anywhere; capacitive readings vary by water hardness/conductivity (geographic issues)\n✅ **No recalibration**: Capacitive sensors drift and need periodic recalibration, IR never does\n✅ **Liquid types**: IR works with clear, opaque, conductive, non-conductive liquids equally well\n❌ **Capacitive problems**: False readings with condensation, affected by temperature changes\n\n**Practical benefits:**\n\n• **Instantaneous response** - no lag time\n• **Programmable timer** - filters foam/bubbles that fool other technologies\n• **Any mounting angle** - top/side/bottom, unlike floats needing vertical space\n• **Extreme conditions** - works -40°C to +125°C, high pressure, high vibration\n• **Install and forget** - no maintenance, no recalibration\n\nThis is why Teklab IR sensors have become the standard in industrial refrigeration, replacing unreliable floats and temperamental capacitive sensors.\n\nWhat type of application are you considering - oil monitoring, refrigerant level, or other liquid?"
