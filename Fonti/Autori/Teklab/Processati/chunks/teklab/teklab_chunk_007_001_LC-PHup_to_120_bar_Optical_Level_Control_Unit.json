It comprises an optical sensor and an output switch. It is realized in two parts to let it possible to replace the electronics without the needing  of emptying or depressurizing the plant. \nThe sensor is suitable as minimum or maximum alarm. \nDelays can be introduced in order to satisfy particular needing or avoid false alarms. \nTypical customizable functions: Activation Delay, Deactivation delay, others, ... \nOperating Principle\n\nThe sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.  \nTechnical Data \n39\nSUPPLY VOLTAGE (± 10%) \n\t230VAC@50Hz / 115VAC@60Hz / 24 VAC@50/60Hz / 24VDC depending on selected model\n\tELECTRONIC PROTECTIONS \n\tTransient over voltage protection\n\tELECTRICAL CONNECTION \n\t3 wires cable, 1m length / M12x1 Connector\n\tOUTPUT SIGNAL \n\tSolid state output Normally Open or Normally Closed in air.\n\tSUPPLY CURRENT \n\t20mA max. during normal operation\n\tOUTPUT MAX.
