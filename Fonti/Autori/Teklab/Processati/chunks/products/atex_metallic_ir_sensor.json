      "content": "Yes, you **MUST use ATEX-certified sensors** for equipment installed in ATEX Zone 2 classified areas. Teklab offers **ATEX Metallic IR Sensors** specifically designed and certified for explosive atmospheres like your ammonia compressor room.\n\n**ATEX Regulatory Requirement:**\n\n**ATEX Directive (EU 2014/34/EU):**\n- Equipment in explosive atmospheres must be ATEX-certified\n- **Zone 2 (gas):** Area where explosive atmosphere unlikely but possible if occurs, will persist for short period\n- **Ammonia (NH3):** Flammable gas, requires Zone 1 or Zone 2 classification\n- **Using non-ATEX equipment in classified zone:**\n  - ❌ Illegal (violates EU directive)\n  - ❌ Insurance void if accident occurs\n  - ❌ Safety hazard (ignition risk)\n  - ❌ Regulatory fines/shutdown\n\n✅ **ATEX-certified sensors MANDATORY in classified zones**\n\n**Teklab ATEX Metallic IR Sensor:**\n\n**ATEX Certification:**\n- **II 2G Ex d IIC T6 Gb**\n  -

legally required in ATEX zones**\n- Safety critical (prevents explosions)\n- Insurance requirement\n- Regulatory compliance\n- **No choice if Zone 1/2 classified**\n\n**Selection Guide:**\n\n**Ammonia System Sensor Selection:**\n\n**Compressor room (Zone 2):**\n- **ATEX Metallic IR** (Ex d IIC T6)\n- Pressure rating: Match system (20-40 bar typical for ammonia)\n- Outputs: Relay + 4-20mA for PLC integration\n- **MANDATORY ATEX certification**\n\n**Control room (non-classified, separate building):**\n- Standard sensors acceptable IF truly non-classified\n- Verify with hazardous area classification drawings\n- When in doubt, use ATEX (safe approach)\n\n**Material Compatibility:**\n\n**Ammonia (NH3) compatibility:**\n- ATEX Metallic IR uses **stainless steel** wetted parts\n- Ammonia-compatible elastomers (special seals)\n- **Verify with Teklab** before ordering (confirm ammonia compatibility)\n- Provide system details (ammonia concentration, temperature, pressure)\n\n**Pressure Rating for Ammonia:**\n\nAmmonia systems vary widely in pressure:\n- Low-temperature systems: 5-15 bar\n- Medium-temperature: 10-25 bar\n- High-temperature (condenser): 15-40 bar\n\n**Select pressure rating:**\n- 46 bar: Adequate for most ammonia systems (< 30 bar)\n- 80 bar: High-pressure ammonia systems (> 30 bar)\n- 130 bar: Ultra-high-pressure (rare for ammonia)\n\nVerify actual system pressure and add 30% safety margin.\n\n**Example Ammonia Plant:**\n\n**Industrial cold storage (ammonia refrigeration):**\n- 12 compressors, 5,000 kW cooling capacity\n- Compressor room classified Zone 2\n- Operating pressure: 12-18 bar (low-temp system)\n\n**Sensor specification:**\n- **12× ATEX Metallic IR sensors**\n- **Pressure rating: 46 bar** (adequate for 18 bar + margin)\n- **Certification: Ex d IIC T6 Gb**\n- **Outputs: Relay + 4-20mA** (to PLC/SCADA)\n- **Material: Stainless steel** (ammonia-compatible)\n- **Total cost: ~$600-800 per sensor** (vs $300-400 for standard)\n- **Mandatory investment:** Safety + regulatory compliance\n\n**Installation Best Practices:**\n\n**ATEX-compliant installation:**\n1. **Verify zone classification** (check drawings)\n2. **Select Ex d IIC T6 sensors** (Zone 1/2 ammonia)\n3. **Use certified cable glands** (maintain flameproof integrity)\n4. **Proper grounding** (equipotential bonding)\n5. **ATEX-trained installers** (certified personnel)\n6. **Documentation** (keep EC Declaration on site)\n7. **No modifications** (voids ATEX certification)\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n\n❌ Using standard plastic sensors in ATEX zones (illegal, dangerous)\n❌ Non-certified cable glands (breaks flameproof integrity)\n❌ Improper grounding (static electricity risk)\n❌ Unauthorized modifications (voids certification)\n❌ Installing without ATEX training (improper installation)\n\n**Bottom line:** For your ammonia refrigeration plant with ATEX Zone 2 classification, **ATEX Metallic IR sensors are mandatory** - legally required, not optional. Standard plastic sensors (TK3+, TK4, LC series) are NOT ATEX-certified and cannot be used in classified zones. The 50-100% cost premium for ATEX certification is justified by safety, regulatory compliance, and insurance requirements. Teklab ATEX sensors provide same ±2mm IR detection accuracy in flameproof metallic housing certified for explosive atmospheres."
