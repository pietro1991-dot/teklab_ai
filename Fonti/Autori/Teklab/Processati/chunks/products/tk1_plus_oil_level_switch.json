      "content": "Technical context:\n\nTK1+ - Basic Oil Level Switch for Refrigeration\n\nKey specifications:\n• Application: Oil level monitoring with alarm output\n• Detection technology: Electro-optic infrared (IR)\n• Output type: Relay contact (normally open/normally closed)\n• Compatible refrigerants: HFC, HCFC, CO2\n• Detection accuracy: ±2mm\n• Response time: Instantaneous\n• Mounting: Direct flange (dual pitch design)\n• Power supply: 24V DC\n• Temperature range: -40°C to +125°C\n• Special features: Programmable timer for transient filtering\n\n🔧 Application: Cost-effective oil level monitoring for compressors with simple alarm requirements\n\nComplete details:\nThe TK1+ is Teklab's entry-level oil level switch designed for basic oil monitoring applications. It uses the same proven infrared electro-optic technology as the TK3+ and TK4 series but with simplified functionality - providing only level detection with relay alarm output.\n\nIdeal for applications where you need reliable oil level monitoring without automatic oil filling control. The relay output triggers an alarm when oil level drops below the detection point, allowing manual intervention or connection to a building management system.\n\nDespite being the basic model, it maintains Teklab's high quality standards: no moving parts, ±2mm accuracy, programmable timer for false alarm prevention, and compatibility with all major refrigerants.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: I need a simple oil level alarm for my small refrigeration compressor. I don't need automatic oil filling, just want to know when oil is low. What's the most cost-effective solution?\n\nRespond as Teklab technical sales expert:\n- Precise and data-driven (cite specifications)\n- Consultative approach (help customer find right solution)\n- Highlight competitive advantages (IR technology benefits)\n- Provide installation/configuration guidance when relevant"

      "content": "For your small refrigeration compressor with simple alarm requirements, I recommend the **TK1+ Oil Level Switch**.\n\n**Why TK1+ is perfect for your needs:**\nYou specifically don't need automatic oil filling - just monitoring with alarm. The TK1+ is designed exactly for this: reliable level detection with relay alarm output at a cost-effective price point.\n\n**Key advantages:**\n• **Cost-effective**: Basic model without unnecessary features you don't need\n• **Simple installation**: Direct flange mounting, 24V DC power, single relay output\n• **Reliable IR technology**: No moving parts (unlike mechanical floats that fail)\n• **Universal compatibility**: Works with HFC, HCFC, CO2 refrigerants\n• **False alarm prevention**: Programmable timer filters foam and bubbles\n\n**Technical specs:**\n- Detection accuracy: ±2mm\n- Temperature range: -40°C to +125°C\n- Output: Relay contact (normally open or normally closed)\n- Response: Instantaneous detection\n\n**Installation:**\n1. Mount directly on compressor crankcase via dual pitch flange\n2. Connect 24V DC power supply\n3. Wire relay output to alarm panel or building management system\n4. Set timer delay (3-5 seconds recommended for oil applications)\n\n**vs Mechanical float switches:**\nTK1+ has no moving parts = no wear, no recalibration, longer lifespan. Mechanical floats typically fail after 2-3 years in refrigeration environments.\n\n**When to upgrade:**\nIf you later need automatic oil filling, you can upgrade to TK3+ or TK4 which add solenoid valve control and 4-20mA output.\n\nWhat refrigerant are you using, and what's your compressor brand/model?"
