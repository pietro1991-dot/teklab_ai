      "content": "For your 8-compressor rack with PLC control system, I strongly recommend **TK4 MODBUS controllers** - this is the ideal application for MODBUS communication.\n\n**Why TK4 MODBUS is Perfect for Your Rack:**\n\n**Centralized Monitoring:**\n- Single PLC monitors all 8 compressors' oil levels and temperatures\n- Real-time visibility: see which compressors need oil at a glance\n- Trend data: track oil consumption patterns per compressor\n- No need to physically check each compressor\n\n**System Integration Benefits:**\n\n✅ **Single Cable per Compressor**: RS485 daisy-chain - simpler wiring than 8 separate 4-20mA circuits\n✅ **Multiple Data Points**: Get oil level + oil temperature + diagnostics + alarms from one device\n✅ **Remote Configuration**: Adjust timer settings, alarm thresholds from PLC - no ladder climbing\n✅ **Predictive Maintenance**: Oil consumption trends predict compressor problems before failure\n✅ **Temperature Monitoring**: Early warning if compressor running hot (bearing wear, refrigerant issue)\n\n**Practical Example:**\nCompressor #3 shows increasing oil consumption over 2 weeks (MODBUS trend data). This indicates:\n- Possible refrigerant leak\n- Oil separator problem  \n- Bearing wear\n\nYou schedule maintenance BEFORE failure, preventing costly emergency shutdown.\n\n**Data Available via MODBUS (per compressor):**\n- Oil level: OK/Low (binary)\n- Oil level: Analog measurement\n- Oil temperature: °C reading\n- Alarm active: Yes/No\n- Operating hours: Cumulative runtime\n- Diagnostic codes: Sensor status, communication health\n\n**vs TK3+ Standard for Your Application:**\n\nTK3+ would require:\n- 8 relay wires + 8 analog (4-20mA) wires = 16 wires to PLC\n- 8 analog input modules in PLC\n- NO temperature data\n- NO remote configuration\n- NO diagnostics\n\nTK4 MODBUS:\n- 2 wires total (RS485 bus daisy-chained through all 8 controllers)\n- 1 MODBUS module in PLC\n- Temperature + diagnostics + remote config included\n- Simpler, cleaner, more capable\n\n**ROI Calculation:**\n- **Initial cost**: TK4 MODBUS slightly higher than TK3+ per unit\n- **Wiring savings**: Massive reduction in wiring labor and materials\n- **PLC I/O savings**: Need only 1 MODBUS port vs 16 analog/digital inputs\n- **Prevented downtime**: Early detection pays for system after preventing ONE compressor failure\n- **Labor savings**: Remote monitoring eliminates daily manual checks\n\n**Payback**: Typically 6-12 months for rack systems like yours.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Install TK4 MODBUS on each compressor (addresses 1-8)\n2. Daisy-chain RS485 cable through all controllers\n3. Connect to PLC MODBUS module\n4. Configure PLC to poll controllers (we provide MODBUS register map)\n5. Set up HMI screens showing all oil levels and temperatures\n\n**Next Steps:**\nWhat PLC brand are you using? I can provide specific integration guidance and MODBUS register documentation for your PLC platform.\n\nAlso need: Pressure ratings for your compressors (46/80/130 bar versions available)."
