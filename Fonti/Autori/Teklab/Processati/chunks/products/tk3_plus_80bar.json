      "content": "For your R410A system operating at 25-28 bar, you need the **TK3+ 80 bar** version. The 46 bar model is insufficient and could fail.\n\n**Why 80 bar is required:**\n\n**Your system pressure:**\n- R410A condensing pressure: 25-28 bar (normal operation)\n- **Safety margin required:** 20-30% above operating pressure\n- Minimum sensor rating: 28 bar × 1.3 = **36.4 bar minimum**\n- **46 bar rating TOO CLOSE** (only 29% margin)\n- **80 bar rating PROPER** (65% margin)\n\n**Pressure rating selection rule:**\n\n✅ **Always add 30% safety margin minimum**\n- Protects against pressure spikes\n- Accounts for ambient temperature variation\n- Ensures long-term reliability\n- Prevents catastrophic sensor failure\n\n**What happens with insufficient rating:**\n\n❌ **If you use 46 bar for 28 bar system:**\n- Marginal operation (only 18 bar margin)\n- Hot summer day → pressure spike to 32-35 bar\n- Sensor stressed, potential seal failure\n- **Risk of sensor rupture, oil leak, compressor damage**\n\n✅ **With proper 80 bar rating:**\n- Comfortable 52 bar margin above 28 bar operating pressure\n- Handles all temperature conditions\n- Pressure spikes absorbed safely\n- **Reliable, long-term operation**\n\n**TK3+ 80 bar Specifications:**\n\n**Pressure Capability:**\n- Maximum working pressure: **80 bar**\n- Suitable for: R410A, R407C, R404A (high-pressure refrigerants)\n- Operating margin: 25-28 bar system = 65% safety margin\n\n**Detection & Control:**\n- IR detection: ±2mm accuracy\n- Automatic oil filling via solenoid valve\n- Relay output: Oil LOW alarm\n- 4-20mA output: Analog monitoring (optional)\n- Programmable timer: 3-10 seconds adjustable\n\n**Physical:**\n- Temperature range: -40°C to +125°C\n- Housing: Reinforced for 80 bar pressure\n- Power: 24V DC\n- Protection: IP65\n- Lifespan: 10+ years\n\n**R410A System Specific Guidance:**\n\n**Refrigerant characteristics:**\n- R410A is high-pressure refrigerant (vs R134a, R22)\n- Condensing pressure: 24-28 bar @ 40°C ambient\n- **Can reach 30-35 bar** in hot conditions (50°C ambient)\n- Requires 80 bar sensors for safety\n\n**Compressor oil:**\n- R410A uses POE oil (polyolester)\n- Compatible with Teklab IR sensor\n- No foam issues typically (POE less foamy than mineral oil)\n- Timer setting: 5-7 seconds sufficient\n\n**Installation for Copeland Scroll:**\n\n**Mounting:**\n1. Identify oil port connection (typically Rotalock or threaded)\n2. Use appropriate Teklab adapter (Rotalock 1-1/4\" common for Copeland)\n3. Mount at 1/4 to 1/3 up oil sight glass\n4. Vertical or near-vertical orientation preferred\n\n**Wiring:**\n1. 24V DC power supply\n2. Relay output to alarm panel or PLC\n3. Solenoid valve control for automatic filling\n4. Optional: 4-20mA to PLC for monitoring\n\n**Configuration:**\n1. Set timer delay: 5-7 seconds (POE oil, R410A)\n2. Test filling cycle\n3. Verify alarm triggers correctly\n\n**Why TK3+ for scroll compressor:**\n\n✅ **Automatic oil management**\n- Scroll compressors sensitive to oil level\n- TK3+ maintains optimal level automatically\n- Prevents bearing failure from low oil\n\n✅ **4-20mA monitoring** (optional output)\n- Track oil level trends\n- Early warning of oil migration issues\n- PLC integration possible\n\n✅ **Reliable detection**\n- ±2mm accuracy vs ±20mm for float\n- No mechanical parts to fail\n- 10+ year lifespan\n\n**Pressure rating comparison:**\n\n**TK3+ 46 bar:**\n- ✅ R134a (12-15 bar systems)\n- ✅ R22 (15-18 bar systems)\n- ✅ Low-pressure refrigerants\n- ❌ R410A (too high pressure)\n- ❌ R407C (marginal)\n\n**TK3+ 80 bar:**\n- ✅ **R410A (25-28 bar systems)** ← Your application\n- ✅ R407C (18-22 bar systems)\n- ✅ R404A (20-24 bar systems)\n- ✅ All low-pressure refrigerants (over-spec is fine)\n- ❌ CO2 transcritical (need 130 bar)\n\n**TK3+ 130 bar:**\n- ✅ CO2 transcritical (80-120 bar systems)\n- ✅ Ultra-high-pressure applications\n- ⚠️ Overkill for R410A (but works, just costs more)\n\n**Cost consideration:**\n\n**TK3+ 46 bar:** $$\n**TK3+ 80 bar:** $$$ (15-20% more than 46 bar) ← **Correct choice**\n**TK3+ 130 bar:** $$$$ (30-40% more than 46 bar)\n\n**For R410A:** 80 bar is sweet spot - proper safety margin without overpaying.\n\n**Real-world example:**\n\n**Customer case:**\n- Copeland ZP54 scroll compressor\n- R410A refrigerant\n- Condensing pressure: 26 bar @ 40°C ambient\n- Initially ordered TK3+ 46 bar (wrong)\n- **We recommended TK3+ 80 bar**\n- Summer heatwave → pressure spiked to 32 bar\n- **80 bar sensor handled it perfectly**\n- 46 bar sensor would have failed\n\n**Quick refrigerant → pressure rating guide:**\n\n| Refrigerant | Operating Pressure | Required Rating |\n|-------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| R134a       | 12-15 bar        | 46 bar         |\n| R22         | 15-18 bar        | 46 bar         |\n| R407C       | 18-22 bar        | 80 bar         |\n| R404A       | 20-24 bar        | 80 bar         |\n| **R410A**   | **25-28 bar**    | **80 bar** ✅  |\n| R744 (CO2)  | 80-120 bar       | 130 bar        |\n\n**Bottom line:** For your Copeland scroll with R410A at 25-28 bar, the **TK3+ 80 bar** is the correct and safe choice. The 46 bar version lacks sufficient safety margin and risks failure during pressure spikes. The modest 15-20% cost premium for proper pressure rating is cheap insurance against sensor failure and potential compressor damage."
