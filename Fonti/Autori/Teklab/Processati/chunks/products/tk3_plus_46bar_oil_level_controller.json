It uses infrared electro-optic technology to detect oil levels in compressor crankcases without any moving parts, ensuring high reliability and long service life. The dual pitch flange design allows easy installation on various compressor brands (Bitzer, Copeland, Carrier, etc.) with optional adapters available.\n\nThe integrated programmable timer filters transients caused by foam, bubbles, or waves in the oil, preventing false alarms. The relay output can directly control a solenoid valve for automatic oil filling, while the 4-20mA analog output enables integration with PLC systems for remote monitoring.\n\nCompared to mechanical float switches, the TK3+ offers superior reliability (no moving parts), no recalibration requirements, and works with clear, translucent, reflective, and opaque liquids. Unlike capacitive sensors, it's not affected by liquid hardness or conductivity variations.\n\n---\n\nQuestion: I have a Bitzer compressor operating at 50 bar with R134a refrigerant. Which oil level controller should I use, and will it work with my system?\n\nRespond as Teklab technical sales expert:\n- Precise and data-driven (cite specifications)\n- Consultative approach (help customer find right solution)\n- Highlight competitive advantages (IR technology benefits)\n- Provide installation/configuration guidance when relevant"

      "content": "For your Bitzer compressor operating at 50 bar with R134a, I recommend the **TK3+ 80bar** instead of the TK3+ 46bar.\n\n**Why this model:**\nYour system operates at 50 bar, which exceeds the 46 bar maximum rating of this model. The TK3+ 80bar is rated up to 80 bar, providing a safe operating margin for your 50 bar application. Always select a sensor with a pressure rating at least 20-30% above your system's maximum operating pressure for reliability and safety.\n\n**Perfect fit for your application:**\n- R134a is an HFC refrigerant → fully compatible with the TK3+ series\n- Bitzer compressors → dual pitch flange design fits most Bitzer models directly (adapters available if needed)\n- Operating pressure 50 bar → safely within 80 bar rating\n\n**Key advantages for your system:**\n• Electro-optic IR technology: no moving parts = higher reliability than mechanical floats\n• Programmable timer (3-5 seconds recommended): filters oil foam and prevents false alarms\n• Dual output: relay for solenoid valve control + 4-20mA for PLC integration\n• ±2mm detection accuracy with instantaneous response\n• Temperature range -40°C to +125°C covers all refrigeration conditions\n\n**Installation:**\nDirect mounting on compressor crankcase via flange. Verify your specific Bitzer model's flange type - we can provide the correct adapter if needed.\n\n**Next step:**\nPlease confirm your Bitzer compressor model number so I can verify the exact flange type and adapter requirements. Do you need automatic oil filling (solenoid valve control) or just level monitoring with alarm?"
