Lower pressure ratings (46 bar, 80 bar) are unsafe and will fail. The 130 bar version provides necessary safety margin, reinforced construction, and CO2-compatible materials for reliable long-term operation in extreme-pressure applications. For professional CO2 rack installations, consider upgrading to TK4 MODBUS 130 bar for comprehensive monitoring and control."
