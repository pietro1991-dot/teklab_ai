      "content": "For a simple alarm application on a chiller water tank, the **LC-PS (Pump Switch)** is your ideal solution - it's Teklab's most basic and cost-effective level switch.\n\n**LC-PS Key Features:**\n\n**Detection Technology:**\n- Electro-optic infrared (IR) sensor\n- ±2mm detection accuracy\n- Instantaneous response (no delay)\n- Universal liquid detection (water, brine, glycol, oil)\n\n**Output:**\n- **Single relay contact** (NO or NC configurable)\n- 5A @ 250V AC switching capacity\n- Direct alarm connection or pump control\n- Simple two-wire installation\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n- **Pressure rating:** 46 bar (standard), 80/130 bar available\n- **Temperature range:** -40°C to +125°C\n- **Power supply:** 24V DC\n- **Housing:** Plastic (corrosion-resistant)\n- **Protection:** IP65 (dust/water resistant)\n\n**For chiller water tank application:**\n\n✅ **46 bar pressure rating sufficient** (water systems rarely exceed 10 bar)\n✅ **±2mm accuracy** ensures precise level detection\n✅ **No calibration needed** - works with water, glycol, any chiller fluid\n✅ **Programmable timer delay** (3-10 seconds) filters false alarms from turbulence\n✅ **10+ year lifespan** vs 2-3 years for mechanical float switches\n\n**Installation:**\n1. Mount at desired low-level alarm point (typically 1/4 up tank)\n2. Connect 24V DC power supply\n3. Wire relay contact to alarm system\n4. Adjust timer delay if needed (typically 3-5 seconds for water)\n5. Test operation\n\n**Wiring example:**\n```\n24V DC Power → LC-PS\nRelay NO contact → Alarm system input\nRelay COM → Alarm system common\n\nWhen water level LOW (below sensor):\n- Relay contact CLOSES → Alarm triggered\n\nWhen water level OK (above sensor):\n- Relay contact OPENS → Alarm cleared\n```\n\n**Cost comparison:**\n- **Mechanical float switch:** $50-100, replace every 2-3 years\n- **LC-PS:** $200-250, 10+ year lifespan, no maintenance\n- **ROI:** One-time investment, no replacements\n\n**vs other LC models:**\n\n**LC-PS** ($) - Single relay, basic alarm/pump control\n**LC-PH** ($$) - Dual relay, high/low alarms\n**LC-XP** ($$) - Relay + 4-20mA for PLC integration\n**LC-XT** ($$$) - Relay + 4-20mA + temperature sensor\n\n**For your needs:** LC-PS is perfect - simple, reliable, affordable.\n\n**Mounting options:**\n- Threaded adapter (NPT, BSP)\n- Welded flange\n- Tank side-mount or top-mount\n- Horizontal or vertical installation (vertical preferred for water)\n\n**Advantages over float switches:**\n- 5× longer lifespan (10 years vs 2 years)\n- 10× more accurate (±2mm vs ±20mm)\n- No moving parts to fail\n- No sticking, no mechanical wear\n- Works at any angle\n- Immune to foam, turbulence (with timer delay)\n\n**Typical applications:**\n- Chiller water tanks (your application)\n- Evaporator/condenser level monitoring\n- Glycol reservoir low-level alarm\n- Pump protection (dry-run prevention)\n- Simple process tank monitoring\n\n**Bottom line:** LC-PS gives you industrial-grade IR detection at entry-level price. Perfect for simple alarm applications where you don't need analog outputs or advanced features. Install it, wire it, forget it - works reliably for 10+ years with zero maintenance."
