How do I determine the correct version - 46 bar, 80 bar, or 130 bar?\n\nRespond as Teklab technical sales expert:\n- Guide customer through selection process\n- Ask clarifying questions\n- Provide clear decision criteria\n- Highlight safety considerations"

      "content": "Great question - selecting the correct pressure rating is critical for safety and reliability. Let me guide you through the selection process.\n\n**Quick Selection Method:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify your refrigerant**\n- **R134a**: Usually 46 bar version (max condensing ~12-15 bar)\n- **R404A, R407C**: Typically 46 bar, sometimes 80 bar for high ambient\n- **R410A**: Always 80 bar version (high-pressure refrigerant, ~28 bar condensing)\n- **CO2 transcritical**: Always 130 bar version (operates 80-120 bar)\n\n**Step 2: Check compressor discharge pressure**\nFind your compressor's maximum discharge pressure from manufacturer datasheet. This is the key number.\n\n**Step 3: Add safety margin**\n- If max discharge pressure ≤35 bar → Choose **46 bar version**\n- If max discharge pressure 36-60 bar → Choose **80 bar version**\n- If max discharge pressure >60 bar → Choose **130 bar version**\n\nThe 20-30% safety margin is built into these ranges.\n\n**Example:**\nYou have a Bitzer compressor using R404A:\n- Compressor datasheet shows max discharge pressure: 28 bar\n- 28 bar + 30% safety margin = 36.4 bar\n- **Recommendation: 80 bar version** (safer choice, handles pressure transients)\n- *46 bar version would work but offers less margin*\n\n**Red Flags - Do NOT Undersize:**\n❌ \"My system normally runs at 20 bar\" - What's the MAXIMUM, not normal?\n❌ \"Evaporator pressure is 5 bar\" - Need DISCHARGE pressure, not evaporator!\n❌ \"46 bar should be close enough\" - Never use sensor at maximum rating!\n\n**To Help You Choose:**\n\nTell me:\n1. **What refrigerant are you using?**\n2. **What's your compressor brand and model?** (I can look up max discharge pressure)\n3. **What's the maximum condensing temperature you expect?** (helps calculate peak pressure)\n\nOr, if you have it handy:\n4. **Maximum discharge pressure from compressor datasheet?**\n\nWith this info, I can definitively recommend 46, 80, or 130 bar version.\n\n**Price vs Safety Note:**\nThe cost difference between versions is minimal compared to the cost of sensor failure or, worse, safety incident. When in doubt, go one size up."
