      "content": "Great question - let me clarify the differences and help you choose the right model.\n\n**Simple Answer:**\n- **TK3+**: Standalone oil level controller with automatic filling + analog output\n- **TK4**: Everything TK3+ has + temperature monitoring + MODBUS communication + advanced features\n\n**What You Get with TK4 (vs TK3+):**\n\n1. **Oil Temperature Monitoring** - TK4 measures oil temperature, providing early warning if compressor running hot (bearing wear, refrigerant leak, etc.)\n\n2. **MODBUS Communication** - Connects to PLC/SCADA via RS485 for:\n   - Centralized monitoring (see all compressors from control room)\n   - Remote configuration (change settings without site visit)\n   - Data logging (track oil consumption trends)\n   - Multiple data points from single device\n\n3. **Advanced Diagnostics** - TK4 reports:\n   - Operating hours (runtime tracking)\n   - Diagnostic codes (troubleshoot remotely)\n   - Communication health status\n   - Sensor performance data\n\n4. **Predictive Maintenance** - Oil consumption trends + temperature data help predict failures before they happen\n\n**To Help You Decide:**\n\nAnswer these questions:\n\n1. **How many compressors?**\n   - **1-2 standalone** → TK3+ likely sufficient\n   - **3+ in rack** → TK4 MODBUS worth the investment\n\n2. **Do you have PLC/SCADA system?**\n   - **No PLC** → TK3+ (MODBUS not useful)\n   - **Yes PLC** → TK4 MODBUS (full integration benefits)\n\n3. **Do you need oil temperature monitoring?**\n   - **No** → TK3+ saves cost\n   - **Yes** → TK4 (integrated temp sensor)\n\n4. **Do you want remote monitoring?**\n   - **No** (local control fine) → TK3+\n   - **Yes** (remote/centralized) → TK4 MODBUS\n\n**Example Scenarios:**\n\n**Scenario A**: Small restaurant walk-in cooler, single Copeland compressor, no PLC\n→ **TK3+** is perfect. Simple, reliable, cost-effective. 4-20mA goes to building alarm panel.\n\n**Scenario B**: Industrial refrigeration rack with 8 Bitzer compressors, PLC-controlled\n→ **TK4 MODBUS** is ideal. Monitor all 8 from PLC, track trends, detect problems early. Wiring savings + predictive maintenance justify higher cost.\n\n**Scenario C**: Single large screw compressor, critical application, need temperature monitoring\n→ **TK4** makes sense even without MODBUS, for the temperature safety feature.\n\n**ROI Consideration:**\n\nTK4 costs ~30-40% more, but:\n- **Rack systems**: Wiring savings + PLC I/O savings offset cost\n- **Critical compressors**: Preventing ONE temperature-related failure pays for upgrade\n- **Predictive maintenance**: Early problem detection saves emergency service calls\n\n**Bottom Line:**\n- **TK3+**: Excellent standalone controller, proven reliable, cost-effective\n- **TK4**: Advanced features for integrated systems and critical applications\n\nBoth use same IR sensor technology - equal reliability.\n\n**Tell me:**\n- How many compressors?\n- Do you have a PLC?\n- Is temperature monitoring important?\n\nWith these answers, I can definitively recommend TK3+ or TK4."
