      "content": "ATEX compliance for ammonia refrigeration systems is critical - both legally required and safety-essential. Let me guide you through proper Teklab sensor selection and installation for your food processing plant.\n\n**Understanding ATEX Requirements for Ammonia Systems:**\n\n**Why Ammonia Requires ATEX:**\n- **Ammonia (NH3) is flammable** (explosive range: 15-28% in air)\n- Potential leak sources create explosive atmosphere risk\n- **ATEX compliance legally mandatory** in EU (and many other countries)\n- Food processing plants have additional safety requirements\n\n**ATEX Zone Classification - Ammonia Compressor Rooms:**\n\n**Zone 0** (rare in ammonia systems):\n- Explosive atmosphere present continuously (> 1,000 hrs/year)\n- Typically not applicable to compressor rooms\n- Would require Ex ia (intrinsically safe) equipment\n\n**Zone 1** (high-risk areas):\n- Explosive atmosphere likely during normal operation (10-1,000 hrs/year)\n- Areas near ammonia leak sources (compressor seals, valve packing)\n- Poorly ventilated spaces\n- **Requires Ex d IIC sensors minimum**\n\n**Zone 2** (most common for compressor rooms):\n- Explosive atmosphere unlikely, brief if occurs (< 10 hrs/year)\n- Well-ventilated compressor rooms\n- Areas adjacent to Zone 1\n- **Requires Ex d or Ex nA sensors**\n\n**Your Teklab Solution: ATEX Metallic IR Sensors**\n\n**Product Specification:**\n- **ATEX certification: II 2G Ex d IIC T6 Gb**\n- Suitable for Zone 1 and Zone 2 (gas atmospheres)\n- Flameproof enclosure (Ex d)\n- Gas group IIC (includes ammonia, hydrogen, acetylene)\n- Temperature class T6 (surface temp ≤ 85°C)\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n**Safety:**\n- Flameproof metallic housing (contains internal explosion)\n- Certified cable glands (prevent flame transmission)\n- Maximum surface temperature ≤ 85°C (safe for ammonia vapor)\n- No ignition source (optical IR detection inherently safe)\n\n**Performance:**\n- Same ±2mm IR accuracy as standard sensors\n- Automatic oil level control (TK3+/TK4 models)\n- 10+ year lifespan even in harsh ammonia environments\n- IP66/IP67 protection (superior sealing)\n\n**Material Compatibility:**\n- Stainless steel 316 wetted parts (ammonia-resistant)\n- Ammonia-compatible elastomer seals (EPDM, Viton)\n- Corrosion-resistant housing (aluminum or stainless steel)\n\n**Food Processing Plant - Complete System Design:**\n\n**Typical Layout:**\n\n**Compressor Room (Zone 2):**\n- 8-12 ammonia compressors\n- Well-ventilated (forced air circulation)\n- Ammonia detectors (safety requirement)\n- **All sensors must be ATEX Ex d IIC certified**\n\n**Sensor Requirements:**\n\n**Oil Level Monitoring:**\n- **8-12× ATEX TK3+ or TK4 sensors** (one per compressor)\n- Pressure rating: 46 bar typical (ammonia low-temp systems 10-25 bar)\n- Output: Relay + 4-20mA to central PLC/SCADA\n- Timer setting: 7-10 seconds (ammonia POE oil can foam)\n\n**Control Room (Non-Classified Zone):**\n- Separate building or well-isolated room\n- PLC/SCADA for centralized monitoring\n- **Standard equipment acceptable** (not in classified zone)\n\n**Installation Compliance Requirements:**\n\n**1. Equipment Selection:**\n✅ **Verify ATEX certification**\n- Check ATEX marking on sensor: \"II 2G Ex d IIC T6 Gb\"\n- Verify EC Declaration of Conformity (keep on site)\n- Ensure certification matches zone classification\n\n✅ **Match zone requirements**\n- Zone 1 → Ex d IIC minimum\n- Zone 2 → Ex d or Ex nA acceptable\n- **Use Ex d for both zones (most common)**\n\n**2. Cable Glands (Critical for ATEX Compliance):**\n✅ **Use only ATEX-certified cable glands**\n- Ex d or Ex e certification required\n- Proper thread engagement (consult gland specs)\n- Maintains flameproof integrity\n- **Non-certified glands VOID ATEX certification**\n\n**3. Grounding/Earthing:**\n✅ **Equipotential bonding required**\n- Connect all metallic equipment to common earth\n- Prevents static electricity accumulation\n- Required by ATEX installation standards (IEC 60079)\n- **Grounding continuity must be verified**\n\n**4. Installation by Qualified Personnel:**\n✅ **ATEX training mandatory**\n- Installers must be ATEX-certified\n- Follow manufacturer installation manual exactly\n- **Any deviation voids ATEX certification**\n\n**5. Documentation:**\n✅ **Keep on site:**\n- EC Declaration of Conformity (for each sensor)\n- ATEX certificates\n- Installation records (as-built drawings)\n- Maintenance logs\n- **Required for regulatory inspections**\n\n**Food Processing Specific Considerations:**\n\n**Additional Safety Requirements:**\n\n**Ammonia Detection System:**\n- NH3 detectors throughout compressor room\n- Alarm thresholds: 25 ppm (low), 150 ppm (high)\n- Automatic ventilation increase on detection\n- **Sensor placement per IIAR standards**\n\n**Emergency Shutdown:**\n- Integrate oil level sensors with emergency shutdown\n- Low oil → compressor shutdown sequence\n- Prevent compressor failure during evacuation\n- **Critical for food safety (prevent prolonged outage)**\n\n**Hygiene Considerations:**\n- Stainless steel sensors (easy cleaning)\n- IP66/IP67 protection (washdown compatible)\n- Smooth surfaces (no contamination harboring)\n\n**System Architecture Example:**\n\n**12-Compressor Ammonia Rack (Food Processing Plant):**\n\n```\nCompressor Room (Zone 2):\n  12× ATEX TK4 MODBUS 46 bar sensors\n  ↓ (one per compressor)\n  RS485 MODBUS network (ATEX-certified cable)\n  ↓\n  ATEX-rated RS485-to-Ethernet gateway\n  ↓\n  Ethernet (fiber optic, Zone 2 → Control Room)\n  ↓\nControl Room (Non-Classified):\n  PLC/SCADA system\n  - Monitor all 12 oil levels\n  - Temperature monitoring\n  - Alarm management\n  - Integration with ammonia detection\n  - Building automation system (BAS)\n```\n\n**Why TK4 MODBUS for This Application:**\n\n✅ **Centralized monitoring**\n- 12 compressors monitored via single network\n- Reduced wiring in classified zone\n- Real-time oil level + temperature data\n\n✅ **Predictive maintenance**\n- Track oil consumption patterns\n- Detect oil migration issues early\n- Schedule maintenance proactively\n- **Minimize unplanned downtime (critical for food processing)**\n\n✅ **Integration with safety systems**\n- Oil level → emergency shutdown logic\n- Temperature → compressor protection\n- NH3 detection → coordinated response\n\n**Installation Process:**\n\n**Pre-Installation:**\n1. **Obtain hazardous area classification drawings**\n   -
