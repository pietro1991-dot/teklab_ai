      "content": "Technical context:\n\nCompressor Oil Management in Industrial Refrigeration Systems\n\n**The Problem:**\nCompressors in refrigeration systems need proper oil levels to function reliably. Oil circulates through the refrigeration circuit and can migrate away from the compressor crankcase, leading to:\n• Low oil level → inadequate lubrication → compressor damage\n• Oil accumulation in evaporators → reduced efficiency\n• Need for oil balancing between multiple compressors in rack systems\n\n**Traditional Solutions and Problems:**\n1. Mechanical float switches:\n   - Fail frequently (moving parts wear out)\n   - Stick due to oil residue buildup\n   - Inaccurate detection (±10-20mm)\n   - Require regular maintenance\n\n2. Manual monitoring:\n   - Labor intensive\n   - Risk of missing low oil conditions\n   - No automatic response\n\n**Modern Solution - Electronic Oil Level Controllers:**\nTeklab oil level controllers (TK1+, TK3+, TK4 series) provide:\n• Continuous automatic monitoring via infrared sensors (±2mm accuracy)\n• Programmable timer to filter oil foam and prevent false alarms\n• Relay output for alarms and solenoid valve control\n• Optional 4-20mA or MODBUS output for PLC/SCADA integration\n• Direct mounting on compressor crankcase (dual pitch flange)\n• Compatible with HFC, HCFC, CO2 refrigerants\n• No moving parts = reliable operation for 10+ years\n\n**System Configuration:**\n- TK1+: Monitoring only (alarm when oil low)\n- TK3+: Monitoring + automatic oil filling via solenoid valve + analog output\n- TK4: Advanced features + MODBUS communication + temperature monitoring\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Our industrial refrigeration rack system has multiple compressors, and we're constantly dealing with oil migration issues. Compressors run low on oil while oil accumulates elsewhere. How can we automate oil management to protect our compressors?\n\nRespond as Teklab technical sales expert:\n- Explain the solution approach\n- Recommend specific products\n- Describe system integration\n- Highlight benefits vs current situation"

      "content": "For your rack system with oil migration issues, I recommend implementing an **automated oil management system using Teklab TK3+ or TK4 oil level controllers** on each compressor.\n\n**Solution Architecture:**\n\n**Individual Compressor Level:**\n- Install TK3+ or TK4 controller on each compressor crankcase\n- Connect each controller to an oil solenoid valve\n- Controllers monitor oil level continuously (±2mm accuracy)\n- When oil drops below setpoint, controller automatically opens solenoid valve to add oil from oil reservoir\n- Programmable timer (3-5 seconds) prevents false triggering from oil foam\n\n**Rack System Integration:**\n- Use TK4 MODBUS versions for centralized monitoring via PLC/SCADA\n- 4-20mA outputs provide analog oil level signals for trending\n- Alarm contacts integrate with building management system\n- Monitor all compressors from single control panel\n\n**Why This Works:**\n\n✅ **Prevents compressor damage**: Automatic oil replenishment before critical low level\n✅ **24/7 protection**: Continuous monitoring, no manual checks needed\n✅ **Eliminates false alarms**: Programmable timer filters foam that plagues mechanical floats\n✅ **Reliability**: Infrared sensors have no moving parts - 10+ year lifespan vs 2-3 years for floats\n✅ **System visibility**: MODBUS integration shows oil levels across entire rack in real-time\n\n**Recommended Configuration:**\n\nFor each compressor:\n- **TK4 MODBUS** (if using PLC/SCADA for rack management)\n- **TK3+ standard** (if using standalone controls)\n- Oil solenoid valve (we can recommend compatible valves)\n- Oil reservoir with level monitoring\n- Optional: Oil separator monitoring\n\n**ROI Benefits:**\n- Prevent one compressor failure = system pays for itself\n- Reduce maintenance labor (no manual oil level checks)\n- Extend compressor lifespan through proper lubrication\n- Improve system efficiency (optimal oil distribution)\n- Remote monitoring reduces site visits\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. How many compressors in your rack?\n2. What pressure ratings and refrigerant types?\n3. Do you have PLC/SCADA system (determines TK3+ vs TK4 MODBUS)?\n4. Compressor brands/models (for flange adapters)?\n\nI can provide a detailed system specification and pricing once I understand your rack configuration."
