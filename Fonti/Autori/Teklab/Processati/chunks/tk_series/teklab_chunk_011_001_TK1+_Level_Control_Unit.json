This product is very reliable and suitable for working in heavy environments. \nLEDs integrated in the electronic module allow to verify the liquid status. \nThe two parts design allows the fast replacement of the electronic parts without depressurizing the system. \n  \n  \nThe electronic module of the TK1+ contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver.
