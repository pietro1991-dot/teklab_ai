    "original_text": "﻿K11 Level Switch 50Operating Principle \nApplication Description \nK11 level switches are suitable for high pressure applications like  pressurized vessels, HVAC and refrigeration, motors etc. They have  bodies made of stainless steel and sensor dome made of glass.  They are economical, dependable, and compact in size with overall  dimensions of 59 x 27 mm and have no moving parts.  These level switches use infrared technology for their operation.  They have an operating temperature range of -40°C to 125°C.  There is a programmable timer inside these K11 level switches that  allows a delay time to be set for delaying the output switching.  The output modes are closed in presence of liquids and open in air or  vice versa.  \nThe AC / DC output current is up to 100mA depending on model. These level switches can integrate electronic protections against  transient over voltage, and reverse polarity (for DC models). They can withstand maximum pressure of 60 bar.\n\nThe sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.  \nTechnical Data \n51\nOPERATION MODE \n\tDetect liquid presence with contact\n\tREPEATABILITY \n\t± 2 mm. \n\tBODY MATERIALS \n\tStainless steel or Nickel plated steel\n\tSENSIBLE DOME \n\tGlass\n\tELECTRONIC PROTECTIONS \n\tTransient over voltage, reverse polarity (for DC models)\n\tMAX.
