Both adapters offer different mounting possibilities and pressure ranges. The TK3+ adapter is suitable for direct mounting and has a lower pressure range (0-130bar), while the TK4 adapter offers more flexibility with its 3/4/6 holes flange and higher pressure range (0-600bar). Consult the selection table and manufacturer documentation to determine which adapter best meets your needs.",
