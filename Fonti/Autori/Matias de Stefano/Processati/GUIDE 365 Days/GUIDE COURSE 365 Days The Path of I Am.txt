Planetary Consciousness  Daily Alignment Guide

(New links from 2024 update) 
  

With Matias De Stefano - 6th Edition / February 2024 -
by Ami Godsgate 
Dear Friends of Alignment Network, 
I hope this guidebook helps you quickly and easily locate the blogs and YouTube  videos that Matias kindly provided to us and you wish to review. Just click the link of  the Blog Subject of your choice for a website post or the Statement for a video; it will  take you straight to the page (- no more forever clicking and searching ☺). 
I first started gathering the materials for my own curiosity and better understandings  of somewhat complicated but wonderful contents. I wasn’t sure why I was so intrigued  by collecting and organizing the information so meticulously on my computer, but it  must have been a call from the Universe! I am very happy and grateful that I could put  this guidebook together and make it available for you and all other network members  who want to travel back on our journey that started at the end of July 2020 or to start  the new journey here and now. 
Please also find the additional video links in the bonus section at the end of this guide.  
Thank you, Matias and Fundación Arsayian, for guiding us to be a part of this great  experience towards consciousness and weaving the planetary networks.  
With Love and Gratitude. 
Ami  
(It’s “a-mi.” It’s Japanese. I sound like having a lot of questions to “I Am” ...)  
Tips for when you do the alignment  
It is best to be physically aligned with the planetary nodes and energy grids of the Earth while you do the alignment. As one of the options, you may go to a nearby church or temple as  they are normally built along the energy grid. Otherwise, please choose any spot that works  for you.  
Please refer to this map to find out which nodes and grids are nearest you.  
If you cannot be close to those locations, do not worry. Just face the direction towards the  closest node or grid located from where you are. Your intention is the most important.  
Let’s get started!
