## Introduction

One , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. I 'm really headache today. I can stand on the headache. I have , and yes , my body is not used to be like this.

So , as you see , the topic for today is swamp. Of course , I am not. I do n't have to be late today to explain anything. Because as you see , it gets me also processing and going in deep.

About this week that I said , yes , today , we are going through the process of the week of the subconscious , related to the mind. When we start to connect to the subconscious , remember that the information is everywhere , is the information that we have inside that is around us , and we should accept it , not judging , just for a minute as it comes. Perhaps most of you are not feeling what I am feeling right now , and the sense of what I am going through , but eventually , everyone of us will go through it processally this.

So , it is not needed to be now , but it is good to understand that whenever it comes , let yourself feel it and not do n't put any mind on it. I am not being able to say anything else.

So , I am going to put the music to do the alignment altogether , so we can slow and be all of us in the same connection as everyday.

So , I recommend you to read the post as information for today. And moments like this , I am better writing than speaking. Thank you. Thank you.
