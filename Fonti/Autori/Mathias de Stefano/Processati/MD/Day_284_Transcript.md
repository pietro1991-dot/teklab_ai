## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you. Why are you?

So Ramadan ended and because of that , weddings has begun again.

So there are two weddings and some others outside.

So I do n't know if you can hear what I 'm listening to but it 's really heavy.

So I hope you do n't otherwise it 's bothering.

So it 's a really big noise. Very , very hard.

So if you do n't listen to this , that.

So today we are in the emotional week of tourists in the day of the heart.

Today , the topic for today is poetry.

So special day , poetry is one of the main arts of humans and the expressions of the soul. It 's incredible how loud is the music.

So imagine if I can hear this like that , imagine the other side , the other side where I am , it 's terrible.

So sorry if I get like this.

So in between these concepts of weddings and this poetry and the concept of poetry , I would like to begin our day today by reading a poem.

## Q&A

So I 'm not the best one on reading poems but I will try to do my best. I would ask for you to listen to the poem very carefully before you make any connector or any thoughts about it , just pay attention to it because it has interesting things behind. I proceed to read this in English. Brightroom , let me erase you.

My precious care is more story than honey. In the bed chamber , honey filled. Let me enjoy your good beauty. Lion , let me erase you.

My precious care is more story than honey. Brightroom , you have taken your pleasure of me. Tell my mother , she will give you the leekesties. My father , he will give you gifts.

Your spirit. I know where to tear your spirit. Brightroom , sleep in our house until dawn. Your heart.

I know where to , where to glad in your heart. Lion , sleep in our house until dawn. You , because you love me , give me pray of your praises. My Lord God , my Lord protector , my she sin , who grades and line heart.

Give me pray , give my pray of your praises. Your place , good as honey. Pray , lays your hand. Pray , lay your hand on it.

Bring your hand over it like you span garment. Cab your hand over it like you span second garment.

So this poem is one of the oldest poems in the world. It 's a Persian poem from 4,500 years ago. And is the oldest known until now discovered in a region of Turkey.

So it 's a very , the author is autonym. And the poem is talking about something really sacred , which is the sacred matrimonio. The poem is talking about the relationship between the skies and the earth. It 's talking about this relation between the goddess nana and the us , the god of agriculture.

So basically the honey is the liquids of the liquids , of the divine. But first into the earth.

So it 's basically both having sex , having an earth , having sex for fertility. They are calling for fertility.

So the next year they could have better food and better harvest. This story that was in relation with the gods , it was trespass in the reality by a king represented by a king and a priestess of nana. Both of them they would have sex in a sacred chamber.

So they would pass on the divinity here on earth to materialize this divinity and to make it more a good year for the people.

So it would be that consumption of sex between the king and one of the priestess. And basically this poem was set in the moment of the sex.

So they could know that the gods and the gods that were having the consumption. As you see , this is the oldest poem of love , love poem. But now you know the story , you can tell this that it was not just a love poem. It was something much more deeper.

It was basically a spell , a spell that was said in order to manifest the divinity into that relationship through sex.

So when they did that , this spell was worth said in order to help the act to be transcendental for the entire civilization , for the fertility and the good year. It was much more bigger. And this takes us to the idea of what a poem was in the beginning of our times. In the beginning of our times , a poem was precisely a spell.

A spell that people used to channel a specific intention from the world of the mind into the matter.

So for sure you have heard sometimes the word abrakadabra. Maybe in English you have heard the Hokusbokus , which is much more used because of a writer in I do n't know which century that he spoke about magic and so on. And so he called himself like that. But actually for sure you have heard the concept of abrakadabra.

Abrakadabra basically means in our main language. Means is dawn or is being created as I speak. This is the right meaning of abrakadabra. Amagadabra which is this spell that usually you have heard in witches or movies or something like that.

Was used by those wizards by those witches in order to start the spells. Because when they used this word , the after that everything that they did was needed to be manifested.

So abrakadabra basically is not talking about an intention for it to happen. It 's talking about something that is happening right now a side-spick. And it 's saying exactly I create a side-spick the word.

So this is the origin of poetry.

So why I 'm saying this is the origin of poetry.

So let 's try to understand what poetry is.

Okay. Abrakadabra means I create a side-safe. I create a side-safe.

So what 's the meaning of poetry? Poetry comes from the Greek word , poyesis. Poyesis comes from Poojaín which is the verb for doing to do. And sees the means action.

So poyesis is the action of doing something.

Okay , poyesis.

So basically poyesis means action of doing something. Which basically is to manifest something , to make something to happen according as I say.

So which is abrakadabra basically is a spell.

So poetry is talking about a spell that helps you to manifest a reality outside.

So according to how you say it you are able to make a new reality. This is why poetry in the beginning of times was basically a way of manifestation a spell. There is different from what we believe about poetry when we speak about it from the romanticism in the 18th century. But we will get there.

And we will get there. Let 's begin by the old way.

So poyesis is basically what the universe do. The universe is in constant action to in stuff , creating things , manifest in itself.

So the entire universe is creating and we interpret that creation through the verb. That 's why we say and God said. Let be light.

So is the verb the one that creates in many cultures. And because of this idea of being the word , the creator , we understand that we also through the verb through the voices can manifest and create using the verbs.

So we started to design different ways to manifest through our words to create in the outside to manifest a reality.

So basically we are poetic beings. Poetic beings means that we are able to manifest to take action in order to create something. And the quality of being able to do something is what in Greek you call poyesia , which in English gave poetry.

So basically the universe is a great poetry and the creation itself is the biggest poem.

So that 's beauty , that 's beautiful. If we say that if we say that the verb is vibration , this means that poetry , the verb is basically using the same patterns as music. What we have here , vibration , everything is vibration.

So this vibration here , the one in violet , is the one we call rayitham. This one here , the three of them in balance in coherence is the one that we call harmony. And then the parts that compose this structure is what we call melody. Melody.

So in music we have this.

So these three are going to be called vibration , energy and matter. Hmm , vibration , energy and matter.

So what we have here is that vibration is basically the rhythm. Vibration is that this thing that violates in this waves. Energy is the harmony because energy is created by different vibrations , positive , negative , neutral.

So the combination of the three different vibrations we have energy. And matter what would be the different parts that structure in different ways , through vibration and energy.

So it 's as you see it 's the same thing. It 's basically the same thing all the time. Hmm.

Okay.

So what we have here is that vibration creates energy and energy helps the matter to exist. Makes the matter. How can we translate this? We can say that the word , the verb , sets an intention in order to be manifested.

It does n't mind. The verb , the word , sets an intention to be manifested.

Okay. This are the three laws of the universe , the three main structures of the universe.

So the three main structures of the universe.

So what we have here then is that the ancient ones , the wise people in the past , what they did was to ask themselves , is the universe , if the universe works like this , so which tool do we have ourselves to manifest reality? Which one would be the tools that we have as humans to do the exactly the same as the universe?

So we have voice. Voice.

So the voice is the one that will be able to manifest from the inside , from our minds , into the outside , through the voice , our truth , our inner truth. Voice.

So energy is action. Energy is action.

So basically what it means that in our world , what we have to , but we have as a tool in order to manifest our voice is the action , is to do something , to move. Basically the movement is the key of energy. And the matter would be the goal , what we call the object or the objective , what we aim to do.

So voice action and the object.

So in order to get the object , what we have to do is to start to move ourselves and to manifest it through our intention , which is the voice to say it , basically.

So here we will get the secret Trinity of Press.

So we have here the secret Trinity of Press , which is the verse , I do n't know this word being how do you say this in English?

So this is the verses , the verse sorry. Yes , Stanza.

Okay. It sounds Italian. Stanza and poem. Thank you.

So what is the verse? The verse is basically one of these lines here , which is the rhythm or the vibration. The vibration. Only one.

Then we have the Stanza , which will be three of them , a line that has rhyme because they rebound like a chord in music.

So they rebound to one another. There are different verses , one verse , two verses , three verses , but they rebound together.

Okay.

So that 's Stanza. And then the poem is the conjunction of all the parts , many Stanzas.

So all this is the poem. The one that makes coherence and gives the meaning to the entire poem.

So what we have here now is that the ancient ones , what they did , was to take a verse , which is verse with some words , specific words , and they create a sentence with those words within specific intention.

## Daily Practice Elements

So this intention will have to create a Stanza. With resonance in different vibrations , so it can match the vibration of the environment. And altogether , we , to the poem , will give the meaning in order to manifest. Basically this is what we call a mantra , a spell , a curse , a blessing.

Okay.

So everything that I can think about , which is to say something , in order to manifest intention , to make it real , to make it happen , is poetry. Because poetry is basically to take action into making something happen. For sure , we have heard many times that be careful with what you say because you have to everything that you say could happen or the the curses can happen and so on. And it 's not that easy.

It 's not that you just say it and it has no , it 's not that easy. Why? Because in order for something to happen , you have to create alchemy. And that alchemy , basically , is to for you , for yourself , to turn yourself into the vibration that you are saying it.

You have to be in the balance in order to manage the information that you say. And also , that information that you say has to be in the same kind of vibration that the environment is because if the environment is in a very different vibration , so you wo n't get to do anything. When you say something , if the environment is vibrating very high and you say something low , it wo n't reach because the environment will change it immediately.

So basically , as a silly sample , it would be like trying to put some , sorry , some blocker , some blocker on your skin and go out a day of rain.

Okay , so it wo n't work. It 's important to understand that the word does n't have any power if you do n't have power. If you do n't have this word that we always say , which is coherence , if the three bodies of yourself , spirits , soul and body , the physical one , they are not connected , they are not aligned. This is like building or having a house , a building with no structure.

So it can fall down. It does n't have really good basement , okay?

So actually , in order to have power in your word , you have to have your power within with yourself inside. I was telling that when I was in child , sometimes , sometimes , or few times , I went to the church because someone was baptized or whatever and I saw how some priest they were n't saying the same words that all the priest does and they are doing anything. I was telling to my mom , I do n't know why what is he saying because it 's not working. What he 's trying to do is not working.

But there were other priests that I saw that they were doing exactly the same words and it worked. It was beautiful what they were creating.

So it 's not about the sentence , it 's not the sentence itself that has the power , is how you say it , it 's the structure and the alignment that you have , okay?

So in the ancient times , they used the poetry as a way of manifesting.

So in order to do that , they needed to learn how to beat themselves , how to gain power within.

So in order to do that , people needed to study how to be in their axis , how to be empowered by themselves.

So poetry , the words that they would say , they would after that be able to manipulate the weather , manipulate people , also to do miracles , to create , to create realities , to do arguments , to make portions , to guide civilizations.

So each word , each letter , is like a key to open a door. Like the language I was sharing to you in some other videos and things. It does n't matter the word , the key , if you have no idea how to turn the key , and which door it is. There are simply words after that , if you do n't know how to use it , okay?

So poetry started to be a way of using the verb , the sound in order to manifest. Poetry started to be used as a way to be used in the ceremonies in order to manifest the divinity , the divine into the matter. It turned out to be a way to describe the path of God 's , what is the path that you have to take in order to become yourself a God? This is why it became to be a way to describe the path of heroes , normal people that ended up being like God 's.

So basically poetry started to be a way to express the love for the divine.

So it became a way to honor God. And eventually , it came a moment with a Renaissance , that poetry started to be used to describe the beauty of the world of human beings. And after that , poetry started to be a way to describe the human love , the relationships , the common life , the wars , sadness , emotions , and revolutions. And as a popular way after the 18th century with the Romania , we started to see poetry as romantic to describe the beauty , the chest away of description , a powerful way to describe.

And we have seen that even though the romantic way that we have poetry , this art has been the key for many revolutions , for many changes , for deep sides of humanity , because even if we still believe that poetry is just romance , the power of the word has taught us that it has much more power than that. In our times , now we are here taking a path to know ourselves , to know that we can create with the verb that we are able to manifest with the word.

So in order to do that , we first have to know ourselves very much. And this is what , in our times , could take us to a new kind of poetry that we call the out-of-poises , which is to the ability to create yourself to make yourself.

So in this path of knowing ourselves , of finding the way in which we can create ourselves , we discover this concept of out-of-poises , which is a term that was used and and taking as a standard by roberto maturing from Chile.

So as a biologist , he explained how the universe is not created by someone , the universe is created by itself all the time.

So basically the universe is this poetry that is being developed in itself. And that 's what we are doing. I guess that from now , we have a different perspective from what is poetry and we can recognize that from the very beginning , poetry has been a way to manifest a way to make the words , the ideas into action to do something with it.

So it was a spell , a mantra , to bring the divinity , the insight into the outside. And that is poyesis , that is poetry. And today in our path of the I. M.

To know that we have the power to create ourselves that action with the words.

So we can now say that we are working the out-of-poises.

## Q&A

So to the question , how can I do in order to start to manifest and create with my word , I will say this? Do n't hurry. First , working yourself , integrate all the information that we have been working with the I. M.

Path during this whole year. And once we do our job of out-of-poises , then we will be able to start work in poyesis. The vibration for today is re.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the statement for today is I. M. Garden of the Heart.

So as you see here , we are using poetry every day because re is one of the sounds that we use in order to create then the ability to manifest the sentence that we do which is the poetry.

So we are doing this every day.

So the statement for today is I. M. Garden of the Heart.

So as you see here , we are using poetry every day because re is one of the sounds that we use in order to create then the ability to manifest the sentence that we do which is the poetry.

So we are doing this every day. The goal for today is an italia. From the proto-so-a-kindum , the metasua ones originates. This means the animal kingdom , from the Latin anime that means that moves all erotic organisms that achieved a sexual development feeding from the energy of other kingdoms or from its own.

Here it quake this several branches of the tree of life. Platforms , nematodes , akinuterms , idari , poryphara , mollusks , analyze , invertebrates and vertebrates. The souls from this kingdom are emotional and have information records useful for the universal mind. See you in the comfort level , close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing.

And I become aware of the space that surrounds me. I 'm a body that I inhabit and my own breathing. I use my imagination to perceive how each of the objects inside of this room starts to disappear , day vanish as the walls , the roof and the floor do so. And become aware of everything vanishing until there 's nothing , just void and myself in the center.

I stare at only one point in the room. I stare at only one point in this void , setting all my intention towards it. I stare at only one point in this room. I put all the intention and energy into it until it becomes a spark.

And from it many others merge , creating a fire that grows. The lightning , the room , the space , the side fields heat on my skin. The recognize that this fire is the living essence of my soul. I recognize that after this fire , I can create my soul , the home of my friends.

I take my hands to the fire and softlands slowly. I start to take this fire , stretching the body , moving slowly like a fine dancing , creating the home around. The shining , the walls , the furniture , the rooms , the garden , the shining , my home. I recognize that every room is a chara that every of all the garden are my intentions , my projects.

The kitchen is my heart. The cover is the skin as the walls are my bones.

Now is the moment to set the intention in each one of these rooms. To see the words , the sentences that will manifest the goal of each space.

So it starts my new fest to say it , creating a side-speak. The night , the night , the night , the night , the night. The night , the night , the night. The night , the night.

I am the garden of the heart. The garden of this fire and home that lives in my heart. With my hands , I take this fire to my heart. I take a deep breath and each one at its own time.

I take a deep breath and take a deep breath and take a deep breath. Thank you for being here.
