## Introduction

Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to everyone. Welcome to all of you to the last day , the tourist day , of the physical week in the month of cancer , which is also our last day , of the 360 days of the IPA. I must thank everyone , every person that has been a company , me throughout all this path , mostly for those who have been since the very beginning , the first five days out of time , 365 days ago. As I explained today in the post , what we have done to now has been to go through the 360 degrees of the sphere.

As I said , each one of the topics that we have been talking about in each one of the days of the 360 days has been each one of them , like a fruit in the tree of life , in this tree of existence , that shape this great tree that we have done in this year. The consciousness tree. And of course in this path of consciousness , the last topic that we are going to talk about is the aspect of being conscious. Along this last month , we have been walking through the three consciousness , the first week we have been going through the subconscious , which is the global information that surrounds us and makes us be where we are from the outside.

In the second week , we have gone through the unconscious , which is all the things that we do n't know that are hidden within ourselves. And this last week , we have been speaking about the conscious aspect , which is the one that can show us what we know and the aspect of reality with whom we can relate to. Throughout this month of cancer , what we have been doing is to understand that we are shaped with different consciousness. And that all this consciousness is about to acknowledge where can we position ourselves in relation with this great family around.

So this family has different ways in which we can relate to according to our consciousness. When we are talking about the conscious itself , we can relate that with the family , with the individuals that we can talk to that we have links with. And when we go to the unconscious , we can also think about all this past relationships , all this unknown existence that are linked to us and our condition and holding what we are , sometimes making us feel safe. And when we speak about the subconscious family , is related to every atom , every molecule that constitute ourselves where we are.

And we are an important part , an important link in that family. When we leave our lives through the subconscious , it 's basically the most known way in which a living being can go through life. Because the subconscious is telling us what to do , what is our future , how can we do our things , what is our past , what we are right now. We are conditioned by the subconscious all the time.

And basically that means that we do n't have free will when we live through the subconscious is a universe who decides who we are , what are we doing. The people that decides to live its life through the unconscious are the people that will receive from the outside the conditions of what to do in their lives. That this outside is related to individuals , people related to culture , friends , family , family tree.

So every act , every idea that we have been receiving from them , every concept we accept them as our own.

So the difference with the subconscious is that the unconscious is something that we decide and that we choose by ourselves. It 's something that we say , I accept in my life.

So for example , ethics , morality , a religion , a belief. Those are the things that kind of shape what we are now , but actually are not us. They are just from others , from previous experiences that we inherit and we relate us our own. This is why most of the people live in their unconscious because we live our lives according to others ' life.

And the conscious in the last way is the one that can discern that can say , I can choose my own destiny. We can go out from the subconscious and the unconscious and understand the whole and decide by my own.

So having free will. The conscious aspect of the being is the one that has the ability to decide by its own mind. And what consciousness means? To understand what is the consciousness we have to go to the etymology of the word , of course , which is con sincere ends.

Con means together , united , sincere means to cut different parts. And ends means a being.

So con sincere is a word that means the being that knows how to unite the different parts , or discern or understand the different parts of the whole.

So the conscious aspect is the one that tells me that the everything is made up with different parts. And all these parts are making the whole.

So in order to understand the whole , I have to recognize that each one of its parts has important , an important place that no one can replace. And by acknowledging the importance of each one of those parts , is how I will be able to understand the whole. What is to be conscious? To be conscious is basically to recognize that there is a whole made up with different parts.

Sometimes we make this mistake , believing that to be conscious is to know everything is to have everything in mind that you already acknowledged all. But to be conscious is not that , is to know that the whole is made with different parts. And the only thing that you have to do being conscious is to acknowledge the importance of each one of those parts. And by that , you have to respect each one of those parts in order to make the whole work.

A way to define consciousness is like something that can define the multi-discipline. What is the multi-discipline? The idea comes from multi which means many a lot. And disciplines that means to grab different things and put them together.

Someone that has discipline is someone that is able to take many different things and organize them as a whole , as something together.

So , a discipline is a matter of work , a career or something like that , that put different topics that are related into one only thing.

So multi-discipline will be that different packages of information work together in order to solve one thing.

So , a discipline for example is biology.

So , to be a biologist , you need to take information from the digital kingdom , animoking the mineral kingdom , human kingdom , and put them all together. And what you join that information together , you call it biology.

So , then the multi-discipline would be when , for example , we have a problem like lower warming. And you need to put a biologist working with , , technologies with the geologists.

So , they can work together with different branches of information to solve only one problem.

So , where do we find consciousness here? We find consciousness when the being the person that has a problem in front does n't believe by itself that knows everything to solve a problem. When you become conscious , you accept and understand the reality that there are many other people that has different informations that can be useful for everyone.

So , I can not solve a problem by myself , my own. I need other points of view in order to solve a problem. That 's what makes you conscious. To be conscious is not to know.

To be conscious is to know that I do n't know.

So , to become conscious is basically that I have to take the place that is mine in this whole. And that I have to do what I am good on doing. And there are many other points of view that are also shaping this great reality. And I become conscious when acknowledging which is my part , I allow myself to trust the others on do their own part.

So , a conscious being would never come and say , I will save everyone. I will do everything to make you safe. To solve all the problems. A conscious being would try to find the best people that knows about enough about every topic to put them all together to try to solve one problem.

So , I say this because along our history as humans , we are speaking about making a conscious network , creating consciousness in this path. But , historically , we tend to speak about consciousness , and even though relying the power of that consciousness to only one , like a master , like a savior or a politician. If we are working for the consciousness of this planet , the main thing that we have to do to acknowledge is to recognize that our part in this , that each one of us has a very important thing to do. And only us , each one of us , knows exactly how to do it.

We are the only ones knowing exactly how to do that.

So , we have to work in order to gain that power back to be what we are supposed to do. Each one has a speciality in this reality.

So , in order to create a constant network , we have to remember to realize that we are all one , that we are all part of this world. But , in order to change to help this world , we should all do something different. We should be original. If we all do exactly the same , there is no consciousness.

If we do what we are supposed to do in this world , respecting the others and what they have come to do to this world , they are you find consciousness. Consciousness is not to mediate. Consciousness is to be respectful with who does n't mediate. To be respectful is consciousness.

It 's to open yourself to every possibility and not close yourself to any belief. To be conscious is to realize that every ray of light is the one that makes the sun bright. It 's the one that makes the idea of the sun. That every drop of water is what makes the idea of the ocean.

There is no drops of water because there is an ocean , but there is an ocean because there are drops of water. This is why when we start a consciousness path , we can not relate to a religion to an ideology to a science. We can not relate to a project that I believe are way of doing things. The only way to be really conscious is by.

And when we are supposed to be , we respect and live the others to be what they are supposed to be. And I 'm saying this because in this path of spirituality , which I call spirituality because it 's not consciousness. When we are in this awakening of our divine , we just can see how a lot of people can maybe believe. Think that the other ones are doing something wrong and that , of course , from my point of view , I am doing it right.

But actually , there is no one doing right things or bad things. Everyone is doing their part. Everyone is doing what they are supposed to do. And now I have to take back the idea to the multidisciplinary.

Because acknowledging that each one has explained their own role. And that does n't mean that we should n't be connected together. And this means that we should respect one another because people working in science or spirituality or religion or in arts. And with light crows from other dimension and others working with the darkness , it does n't mean that we should be separated because each one is doing their own.

It means that each one is doing it 's part , but we can all work together. The only reason why we believe that there are opposite forces to our work is because we believe that we are supposed to be connected. We believe that we ourselves are a force in opposition. In a sphere , there is no force of opposition.

In a sphere , each aspect is doing its own job to hold the everything.

So acknowledging this forces is how we are going to relate that we are conscious , respecting the others. We have to understand that as we said yesterday , the forces of opposition , they are not one against the other. They are forces , correlation to one another. When we call bad good , the light , the darkness , darkness.

They are just positive and negative , which are the charges of the basis of matter that moves energy. Without positive and negative , there is no movement. If you have all positive , nothing exists. You need the movement of positive and negative in order to create to manifest.

So to be conscious is to respect this movement of constant energy. This is why I call this a path of consciousness. Because we are not here together to make a change in the world or to save the world. We are here to know the world , to acknowledge the different parts of the world and to see which one of them we can relate to.

So we can awake our potential to do something with it.

Today we end with this 360 days of consciousness in which we have been talking about different topics that are not arable to follow. But they are just suggesting of ideas that you can take and do something new with it. And because this is a path of consciousness , it will never end. It will never end.

It was just one year. This next five days out of time , we will be integrating in consciousness. The 360 topics that we have spoken about. Tomorrow , integrating the three months of fire.

Then the three months of earth. Then the seed of the essence. After that , the three months of water. And the last one , the three months of air.

This next five days out of time , we will be connecting , unifying this whole year of consciousness. And wrapping the circle in order to jump into a new level into a new circle. All was for is the first day of a new year. It begins a new year of 360 new days.

So in the first six months of this new year , we will be working with the practice of everything that we have been learning in this previous year. That 's the path of the dragon. And from 2022 February , in the second part of this year , this new year , we will start to work together to create the idea of what would be a conscious world.

So a cycle ends , but a new one begins. Maybe we are not going to be every day connected as this year , but we will be all together working in this path of consciousness. I remind you that from tomorrow , we will be this five days out of time. Uniting and integrating all the concepts and topics of this whole year.

We will be working with the elements of fire , earth , ether , water and air.

## Q&A

Today , on the fourth , we will unite to celebrate this new year that begins. I will start to share information about how are we going to be aligning for our task in the blue moon in August , 22. And from that moment on , we will start to prepare ourselves for entire path of dragon. To follow everything and to be updated with every transmission that we will do every information that we have to work with.

You have to subscribe to this channel , our Information channel.

So you can be notified about the new videos.

Remember to follow the social media , my own , the I am social media and foundation , our Information social media. Where we will post everything. And I invite you all that since this August 4 , we all could work with our own consciousness , acknowledging about ourselves , wondering for new information. And recognize that in order to become a conscious world , not everyone must do exactly the same.

And remember also , I have been here sharing with you this whole year information that about everything , of course. But everything that I shared is just what I can share and what I know that I can share. But since this new year , I invite you to open yourself to look for many other people that know about many other topics that can improve this knowledge , this awareness.

So be open to learn from all of them , from many different people , from many different practices.

So you can learn about the whole with consciousness , not just following one person. If from this , if from this , always for , we do n't see each other anymore , or some days we do n't see each other.

So remember that there are many more doing stuff.
