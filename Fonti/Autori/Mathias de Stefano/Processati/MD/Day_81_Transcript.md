# Day 81 - Logic and Illogic

## Overview

Welcome to Libra's Physical Week. Matías begins by clarifying: duality is not two things fighting—that's human distortion. For the universe, this is polarity: positive and negative poles creating magnetic energy. We need polarity to exist.

Biology demonstrates truth: two cells dividing (meiosis), two eyes (depth perception), two hands (balance). The brain works in a cross—right brain controls left body—yet the whole brain works together. Duality helps us maintain equilibrium.

Today explores logic (logos = mind/idea) versus illogic (anesthesia = feelings/sensations). These are complementary tools. Logic is mind pulsing ideas outward. Illogic is impulses returning wisdom through experience. The universe operates on pulse and impulse.

Revolutionary insight: imagination (illogical tool) helps logic understand itself. You become wise by living, not reading. Experience is how the mind recognizes what it created. Spirituality means "quality of breathing"—being here now in your body.

## Core Teaching

### Duality Is Actually Polarity

Humans misunderstand duality as conflict. For the universe, polarity means positive and negative poles creating magnetism that generates energy. We need this to exist.

Biology shows: meiosis (one cell becoming two), mirrored body parts (eyes, ears, hands, legs), brain hemispheres working as one unit. Everything uses duality for balance.

### Logos: Mind Creating Reality

Logos (Greek) means idea, concept, thought. Everything is vibrations and atoms, but your brain creates ideas about it. Ancient philosophers understood: the world is made of invisible things. The only reason something appears real is the idea we have.

If everything exists through ideas, something connects it all—a mind. But not "God thinking" (requiring God's creator). God IS the mind itself. There is no God, only mind. The first law: mentality.

### Illogic: Feelings Assimilate Experience

Illogic encompasses feelings and sensations. The mind pulses ideas outward; creation sends back impulses of information. The universe is pulse and impulse.

The only way mind recognizes what it created is by feeling. Not thinking—living. You must experience to understand. Wisdom comes from experience, not reading.

### Imagination: Tool Logic Needs

Scientific experimentation requires imagination. The only way you recognize something can be done differently is imagining new possibilities.

Imagination (illogical tool) helps logic understand itself. Humans evolve through imagination—dreaming change is possible.

### The Problem with Logic as Methodology

Logic becomes method (methodology), which replicates as ideology. Ideologies disconnect from feelings and reality. We need civilization able to feel beyond logic.

Even spirituality becomes ideology when we create methods. True spirituality is feelings that change constantly, not rigid ideas.

### Spirituality: Quality of Breathing

The word spirituality comes from "quality of breathing." It's that simple. Spirituality is being here now, breathing in your body. The rest is logic and illogic.

## Practice: Crown Activation and Wave Movement

**Preparation:**
- Sit or lie comfortably
- Legs uncrossed, open
- Stretch, massage body
- Focus on breathing

**Wave Movement (Each part rests after moving):**

1-9. Left side sequence:
   - Left foot: toes, ankle
   - Left knee, hip
   - Turn body left, return center
   - Left hand: fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder
   - Head circles toward left

10-18. Right side sequence:
   - Head circles toward right
   - Right shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers
   - Turn body right, return center
   - Right hip, knee, ankle, foot, toes

**Crown Activation:**

19. Touch crown with two pointing fingers
20. Press and circle—massage crown
21. Press like "molding pizza, opening crown chakra"
22. Feel light entering head
23. Relax hands, feel sensation

**Integration:**

24. Activate vibration SSka
25. State: "I am spiritual evolution. I am spirit in my body."
26. Move through activated joints (crown → feet)
27. Spread consciousness through body parts
28. Open eyes

**Closing:** Massage feet for energy exchange. Physical Week requires body comfort.

## Key Insights

1. Duality is polarity creating energy, not conflict
2. Brain works as whole despite hemisphere specialization
3. Logos (mind) is creator; "there is no God, only mind"
4. Logic pulses ideas out; illogic impulses wisdom back
5. Wisdom comes from living, not reading
6. Imagination helps logic understand itself
7. Universe operates on pulse (projection) and impulse (return)
8. Ideology makes mind rigid; perception requires feeling
9. Spirituality as methodology becomes religion
10. "Spirituality" means "quality of breathing"
11. Everything is vibrations/atoms interpreted as ideas
12. First law: mentality (mind creates reality)
13. Feelings let mind assimilate what it creates
14. Pulse thoughts → experiences; impulse back → wisdom
15. Balance recognizes logic and illogic as partners

## Integration

**Daily:** When encountering "illogical" experiences (creative, emotional, intuitive), recognize impulses returning wisdom from experience.

**Weekly:** Practice wave movement meditation activating joints from left foot through crown.

**Monthly:** Examine where you've made logic rigid ideology. Allow imagination to help logic understand differently.

**Ongoing:** Remember spirituality is breathing quality. Return to simple breath awareness in body, here now.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: Why say God doesn't exist if logos is creator?**
A: God is not someone thinking (requiring creator). God IS mind itself. When we say "God," we project human attributes onto pure mind.

**Q: Are emotions more important than thinking?**
A: Neither is superior—complementary poles. Mind pulses ideas; feelings impulse wisdom. Both needed.

**Q: How can imagination help science?**
A: Experimentation requires imagining new possibilities. Logic analyzes what exists; imagination creates what could exist.

**Q: Why does brain control body in cross pattern?**
A: Demonstrates duality creates balance through integration. Left and right work together through crossing.

**Q: Difference between pulse and impulse?**
A: Pulse: outward projection (mind sending ideas). Impulse: inward return (creation sending wisdom).

**Q: Is reality an illusion if everything is ideas?**
A: From atoms/vibrations perspective, yes—you see interpreted ideas, not objective "things." Mind is primary.

**Q: Why do "illogical" things?**
A: World's logic became rigid ideology disconnected from feeling. Illogical actions can help stuck logic perceive differently.

**Q: What does "breathing quality" mean practically?**
A: Stop making spirituality complex methodologies. Essence is being here now, breathing in body. Presence is foundation.

## Closing Reflection

What humanity calls "duality" the universe knows as polarity—complementary forces creating energy, not enemies. Logic (mind pulsing) and illogic (feelings impulse) are dance partners.

Ancient wisdom: "there is no God, only mind" frees us from external authority. We are expressions of one mind observing itself through infinite perspectives.

Spirituality lives in breathing quality, presence in body, here now. Your mirrored body parts don't fight—they create balance letting you walk, see, hold, breathe. That's duality's truth.
