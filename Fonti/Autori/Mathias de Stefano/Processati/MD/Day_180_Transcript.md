## Overview

Today is Day 180, the closing of the month of Capricorn and the completion of the mental week of Aquarius. We have spent an entire month deep in the cave of Capricorn, learning about our past, about the patterns and structures that created civilization, about the work that must be done to build strong foundations. Today, we emerge from that cave with a final, unifying concept: **organism**.

We connect with the **toroid chakra**—the field that surrounds the body, the energetic structure that connects the internal with the external, that shows us we are not closed systems but open, flowing, interacting organisms. The toroid represents the eternal movement, the constant exchange between inside and outside, self and universe.

The word **organism** comes from the Greek **"organ,"** which means **instrument**. And **organism** means **the movement of the organ, the action of the instruments**. This teaching will challenge one of the deepest illusions of human experience: the belief that you are separate from the universe, that there is an inside (you) and an outside (everything else), and that these two are in conflict.

Today you will learn the difference between **interaction** (the natural flow of the universe) and **contraction** (the fear-based pulling away that creates suffering). You will understand how **consciousness** and **unconsciousness** are created, how **coherence** and **incoherence** emerge, and most importantly, why the universe is not going anywhere—it is **constant**, eternally in the same spot, expanding and contracting in an eternal process of knowing itself.

This is the summary of Capricorn. This is the closing of the work. And this is the foundation upon which we will build the future.

## Core Teaching

### What is an Organism?

The word **organism** comes from the Greek word **organ**, which means **instrument**. And **organism** means **the movement of the organ or the instrument**—the action of the instruments.

You have probably heard these concepts through religion and the new age: "We are instruments of God," or "We are the instruments of the universe." But as humans, we have a very distorted perception of what is an instrument.

Let's go into understanding why people used to say we are instruments of the divine in different ways.

### The Illusion of Inside and Outside

First of all, as humans, we perceive the universe as **the internal myself (as a body, as my mind)** and **the external projected outside**. So in this idea of dividing the universe, we see:

- The inside (me, my body, my thoughts)
- The outside (the world, others, the universe)

The reason we perceive the universe like this is **because we have eyes**. We see outside, and when we close our eyes, we see inside. So we project that everything I see outside is separated from me because of this. "I" as an individual can use the outside, or the outside can use me.

**This polarity is born because of that projection—the projection of polarity in all the universe.**

### Polarity, Correspondence, and Duality

Remember, by the **law of polarity**, the universe projects itself in **correspondence**. So by this, we create polarity: positive and negative, inside and outside.

We move from the inside to the outside and we start to create by **correspondence**. But suddenly we start to live this correspondence through **consciousness**, and consciousness is the way in which the law of polarity and correspondence will be seen as **duality**.

**Duality is the unconscious way to understand the law of correspondence and polarity.**

What does this mean? Instead of seeing all the different possibilities of creation, we just start to see:
- Inside OR outside
- Up OR down
- Right OR left

We go from one point to another, like a pendulum swinging back and forth. The concept is this: **When we start to make like a pendulum, once and again, it's not the law that is dropping you in this way of duality. It is your perception of the law that drops you in this reality.**

I hope you get this because it's important.

### Interaction vs. Contraction

Through the unconscious way of this polarity, usually by this law, we have to **interact**.

**Interaction means action in between**—your action is linked to all the parts. So you evolve by **transformation**, using the forces of both sides.

But when you are not in interaction, what you create is **contraction**.

**Contraction** is when, instead of just moving and using the force of everyone in this connection, you **go back to yourself and try to contract, to put the strength in you**. So when you push again, you will use this strength **against** the other, believing that is the opposite.

**So you fight against the other.**

What happens in this movement is that we create the **fight, the conflict**. We start to believe that the other is the opposite instead of the force that helps me evolve.

**This is important to understand how we create all the wars, the conflicts that we have in our lives.**

This is how the **unconscious** is being created—believing that there is an external and an internal, and that they are enemies.

### Consciousness vs. Unconsciousness

The **unconscious** is the one that believes that the external and the internal are one against the other instead of interacting.

**Consciousness** brings us to **coherence**. How is that?

Because consciousness is the one that believes that the outside and the inside are different—they are positive and negative, they are separated. And because of this, we start to lose connection.

This connection that we are losing because we believe things are separated is what starts to separate the links in between the **spirit, the body, and the soul**. We start to disconnect ourselves from the different realities.

And this is why we become **incoherent**.

Why is this? Because **coherence** means the **transit of information from one to another**. "Co" means **in between many**, and "in" is that **there is not**. So **incoherence** is when you have **no ability to share information in between different people, different aspects**.

That's coherence. When you lose connection, you lose coherence.

**You live in incoherence when you are disconnected from your own self.**

### We Are Not Separate—We Are Instruments

When we become incoherent and unconscious of ourselves, because of these two concepts, we start to believe that we have disconnected from everything. So the outside can control us, or we can control the outside.

This is where the sentence comes from: "We are instruments of the divine."

But the truth is: **We are not instruments of something separate. We ARE instruments. We are organs. And the organism is the movement of all the organs together.**

**The universe is one organism, and you are one organ within it—not separate, not controlled, but interacting, moving, flowing with all the other organs.**

When you understand this, you stop contracting. You stop fighting. You start interacting. You start being coherent—sharing information, energy, consciousness with all the other parts of the organism.

## Capricorn Summary: The Constant Process

### The Teaching of Constants

One of the main topics of the entire month of Capricorn was **constant**—being constant, working constantly, never stopping.

The important thing about this month was **constancy** because it's a way to understand how the universe works. **The universe is not something that has an end.** It's not something you have to go through to accomplish and then finish. The universe is a **constant process**, which is **eternity**.

That eternity, that process of eternity, means that **the universe is not going anywhere**—it is always in the same spot, and it's only **expanding and coming back**.

Why? Because **constant** comes from the word **"con"** (all the things) and **"stand"** (study, to be in a place, to settle). So **constant** means **something that is always in the same spot**.

That's why Capricorn teaches about constant sleep—because it says, "It's never enough. I will be always in the same spot, which is the process."

**The same spot IS the process.**

The universe is in **constant process of knowing itself**. It's an eternal process of expansion. So the month of Capricorn is teaching us that **there is no end**, that there is **no goal** in the universe like enlightenment, like ascension, like going somewhere.

**It's basically to know that this is an eternal process**, and that me, myself, I am doing all this to try to **expand, to understand myself, to see what am I capable of**.

### The Need for Patterns

In this expansion of the universe, we go out in so many possibilities that it is so wide that it's impossible—it's so easy to get lost.

So that's why the universe creates **patterns**, creates a **plan**, creates all these different **structures** that are patterns ruled by laws, so we can find our path and not get lost in this expansion.

**So that's another key for Capricorn: The universe structures itself and creates all these patterns so we can use them to help us not to get lost.**

All the structures of the universe are not there to put us in limits and like in a cage, but to **guide us and to help us not to get lost**.

Remember: **It's only when I acknowledge this that I start to use the patterns as tools, and the tools are not using me.**

This is why the main goal of the whole month was to learn **how to use these tools of the universe**.

And remember the sentence for this month: **"I USE."** Our goal is to learn how to use the instruments that we are.

## Practice

### Becoming a Conscious Instrument

Today's practice is about recognizing yourself as an organ within the organism of the universe. You are not separate. You are not fighting. You are interacting.

**Step 1: Feel the Toroid**  
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Close your eyes. Imagine a field of energy surrounding your entire body—like a donut shape (toroid) that flows from the top of your head, down around your body, up from the earth, and back through your heart.

This is not your body. This is not separate from the universe. This is the field where inside and outside meet and exchange.

**Step 2: Recognize Interaction**  
Place one hand on your heart. Breathe in, recognizing: "The air I breathe comes from outside me." Breathe out, recognizing: "The air I release goes back to the outside."

You are not separate from the air. You are not using it. You are interacting with it. You are an instrument through which air moves.

**Step 3: Release Contraction**  
Notice anywhere in your body where you are holding tension, contracting, pulling away. Breathe into that space. Ask: "What am I fighting? What do I think is against me?"

Then release. Let the contraction become interaction. Let the fight become flow.

**Step 4: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"Sh"** three times, feeling it resonate in the field around your body, in the toroid, in the eternal movement.  
Then speak: **"I Am the Eternal Path."**  
You are not walking TO somewhere. You are the path itself, eternally unfolding.

**Step 5: Practice Coherence**  
Today, in one interaction with another person, practice coherence. Share information. Listen. Allow energy to flow between you. Do not contract, do not fight. Simply interact.

## Key Insights

- **"Organism comes from 'organ' (instrument) and means the movement of the instrument, the action of instruments."**

- **"We perceive inside and outside as separate because we have eyes—we project this polarity onto the universe."**

- **"Duality is the unconscious way to understand the law of polarity and correspondence."**

- **"Interaction means action in between—your action is linked to all parts, and you evolve by transformation."**

- **"Contraction is when you pull back into yourself and use strength against the other, believing they are opposite rather than complementary."**

- **"This is how we create all wars and conflicts—by contracting instead of interacting."**

- **"Consciousness that believes inside and outside are separate creates disconnection between spirit, body, and soul."**

- **"Coherence means the transit of information in between. Incoherence is the loss of connection, the inability to share information."**

- **"We are not instruments OF the divine—we ARE instruments. We are organs in the organism of the universe."**

- **"Constant means always in the same spot—the universe is not going anywhere, it is eternally expanding and contracting in the same place."**

- **"The universe is in constant process of knowing itself—there is no end goal, no final enlightenment."**

- **"Patterns and structures are not cages—they are guides so we don't get lost in the infinite expansion."**

- **"When you use the patterns as tools, the tools are not using you. This is the teaching of 'I USE.'"**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Notice One Contraction:**  
Today, catch yourself in one moment of contraction. It might be:
- Pulling away from someone
- Defending yourself unnecessarily
- Holding tension in your body
- Fighting against a situation

When you notice it, pause. Breathe. Ask: "Can I interact instead? Can I flow with this rather than push against it?"

Then try. Even just for a moment.

**Practice Being an Instrument:**  
Choose one activity today—eating, walking, working, creating. Do it with the awareness: "I am not doing this. I am the instrument through which this is being done."

You are not separate from the action. You are the organ through which the universe is moving, creating, expressing.

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching of organism is the teaching of **unity**, but not in the fluffy, abstract sense. It's practical unity: You are one organ in one organism. When you contract, you create disease in the organism. When you interact, you create flow, coherence, health.

Every conflict in your life—with people, with circumstances, with your own body—is a place where you've moved from interaction to contraction. You've forgotten you're part of one organism and started believing you're a separate entity that must fight or defend.

The shift is simple but profound: Stop contracting. Start interacting.

This doesn't mean you have no boundaries. Organs have membranes. They have distinct functions. But they don't fight the other organs. They work with them. They share information. They flow.

**You are an instrument. The universe is the organism. Your job is not to control, not to transcend, not to escape—it's to play your note in the symphony. To move as the organ you are within the greater body.**

## Aquarius Mental Week Summary

This week, we learned to think systemically. We explored:
- **Culture** (cycles of time, moving through houses)
- **Agriculture** (the root of civilization, our relationship with earth)
- **Fundamentals** (the basement that holds all growth)
- **Schemes** (frameworks that contain information)
- **Organism** (the movement of instruments in interaction)

All of these teachings point to one truth: **You are not separate. You are part of patterns, cycles, systems, organisms.** The mental work of Aquarius is to recognize these patterns and use them consciously rather than being used by them unconsciously.

The toroid chakra today (Sh - I Am the Eternal Path) represents the completion of this understanding. The toroid is the shape of interaction—energy flowing in, through, and out, eternally. You are not a closed system. You are an open, flowing, interacting organ in the body of the universe.

## Capricorn Month Summary

We are closing the month of Capricorn with gratitude for the work we have done. We have been in the cave, in the depths, in the past, learning:

- That we are animals who need to eat, sleep, and reproduce
- That all civilization is built on agriculture, on working with the earth's cycles
- That our bodies are not ours alone—they are collective bodies built by ancestors
- That patterns and structures are not prisons but guides
- That the goal is not to transcend but to use—to learn to use the instruments we are

**The sentence of Capricorn is "I USE."** And now you understand: You are the instrument, and you are learning to use yourself in coherent interaction with the organism of the universe.

Tomorrow, we leave the cave. We move into the future. But we take with us the foundation, the basement, the fundamentals we have built this month. We do not break them. We build upon them.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does it mean that we are instruments, not instruments OF something?

It means there is no separate "divine" controlling you like a puppet. You ARE the divine expressing itself as an instrument. You're not being used by the universe—you ARE the universe, in one of its forms, moving, acting, creating. The instrument is not separate from the musician. You are both.

### Q: How do I know if I'm in contraction or interaction?

Contraction feels like tension, defense, pulling away, fighting. You feel separate, threatened, like you must protect yourself. Interaction feels like flow, exchange, openness. You feel connected, safe enough to allow energy to move through you rather than storing it as tension.

### Q: What is coherence in practical terms?

Coherence is when information flows smoothly between different parts of a system. In your body: when your thoughts, feelings, and actions align. In relationships: when communication is clear and reciprocal. In life: when your inner state matches your outer expression. Incoherence is static, blockage, misalignment.

### Q: If the universe is constant and not going anywhere, what's the point?

The point is the process itself—the eternal expansion and contraction, the constant knowing of self. You're not trying to GET somewhere. You're exploring what you're capable of, how far you can expand while staying connected to the center. The point is the experience, the movement, the becoming. There is no destination. There is only the eternal path.

### Q: How do patterns help me not get lost?

In infinite expansion, you could go in any direction forever. Patterns (like seasonal cycles, chakra systems, astrological houses) give you a map. They say: "This is where you are. This is the phase you're in. This is what comes next." Without patterns, you'd have infinite freedom but no way to navigate it. The patterns are not limitations—they're orientation.

### Q: What does the toroid chakra represent?

The toroid is the energetic field around your body, shaped like a donut. Energy flows up from the earth through your central channel, out the top, around the outside, and back in from below. It represents the eternal circulation, the interaction between inside and outside, the truth that you are not a closed system. You are always exchanging with the universe.

### Q: How do I practice being an organism rather than a separate individual?

Notice when you think "me vs. them" or "me vs. the world." That's the illusion of separation. Instead, think: "We are one system experiencing itself through different organs." When you breathe, you exchange with the air. When you eat, you exchange with the earth. When you speak, you exchange with consciousness. You are already an organism—just become aware of it.
