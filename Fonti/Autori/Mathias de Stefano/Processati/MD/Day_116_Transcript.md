## Overview

Day 116 addresses one of the most misunderstood and stigmatized human experiences: depression. Matias teaches from within the emotion itself, transparently sharing that he is feeling depressed today specifically so he can speak authentically about it rather than offering cheerful advice from outside the experience.

This honesty demonstrates the core teaching: **we usually speak about depression when we're feeling fine, trying to "fix" people who are depressed so we feel more comfortable**. But true understanding requires speaking from within the darkness, not from the outside looking in.

The word "depression" literally means "de-pression"—**to set down pressure, to press downward**. There are two types: unconscious depression (pressure from outside pushing you down, needing someone to blame) and conscious depression (recognizing you are the only one responsible for where you are, choosing to go deeper).

The radical teaching: **depression cannot be healed. It can only be accompanied.** Like teaching someone afraid of water to swim rather than pulling them out, the practice is to help people move through depression, not escape it. The soul needs depression the same way the body needs sleep—to integrate, to rest, to go within and find answers in the subconscious.

## Core Teaching

### Speaking From Within Depression, Not About It

Matias begins with transparency that challenges conventional spiritual teaching: he's feeling depressed today, and rather than hiding it or pretending to be joyful, he's choosing to teach about depression while experiencing it.

This is crucial because **we usually don't want to speak about these emotions from within**. We speak about depression when we're feeling fine, giving advice from a place of comfort:

"Oh, you just have to do this and that and everything will be perfect! You'll get away from that situation perfectly!"

But this advice, delivered while happy, misses the reality of what depression actually feels like from the inside. It's like someone who has never been in deep water telling a drowning person to "just swim"—technically correct but practically useless.

**We don't want people to feel bad because their discomfort makes us uncomfortable.** So we say "stop crying, everything is going to be okay" not because we want them to feel better, but because we want ourselves to feel better around them.

True companionship in depression requires **sitting with someone in their darkness without trying to change it, fix it, or escape it**. This is what Matias models by teaching from within the emotion.

### The Two Types of Depression

Depression manifests in two fundamentally different ways, depending on the level of consciousness operating:

#### Unconscious Depression: Pressure From Outside

**Unconscious depression is when you feel the pressure of the world, of people around you, of circumstances pushing you down.**

This type needs **polarity**—it needs someone or something to blame for why you feel this way. The unconscious mind says:

"This is happening TO me. The world is doing this. Other people are causing this. The situation is pressing me down. Therefore, I can blame them for what is happening to me."

This depression comes from outside forces pushing inward. You feel like a victim of circumstances, trapped by external pressures you cannot control.

The unconscious depression believes: "If only external things would change, I would feel better."

#### Conscious Depression: Pressure From Within

**Conscious depression is when you recognize that there is no 'other'—that everything is one, and you are the only one responsible for the place where you are.**

This realization is not liberating in the way we usually imagine. When you become conscious that **you alone are responsible for your depression**, there is nowhere to project the blame. No one else to fix it. No external change that will save you.

The conscious mind says:

"I am the only one responsible for this position of being depressed. This is my creation. I cannot blame anyone else."

This might sound like it would create even more suffering, but actually it opens a profound possibility: **the conscious choice to feel depression because you need to feel it**.

### Conscious Depression: Choosing to Go Deeper

Here is the teaching that contradicts most mainstream psychology and spiritual bypassing:

**Conscious depression is very different from unconscious depression because this is the depression you need, that you're willing to feel, that you need to perceive.**

When you consciously choose depression, you are saying:

"I want to feel this. I want this. I want to feel comfortable in this situation like this."

This is not masochism or dysfunction—this is **the soul needing to touch the bottom of darkness to find what it's looking for**.

When people say to you in this state: "You're going to be better. You have to get outside from that. You have to feel happy. Don't worry, this will end"—**it's kind of annoying.**

Why? Because **the soul needs to touch the bottom. Otherwise it feels like it can't breathe, like it's not able to put feet on the ground before it jumps and goes up again.**

### Touching the Bottom: Losing All Meaning

One of the most challenging aspects of deep depression is that **when you touch the bottom of the darkness, everything loses meaning**.

In that place:
- Nothing makes sense
- Everything feels senseless
- It's horrible
- There is no meaning to anything at all
- You stop feeling everything, needing anything, needing to touch anything

In that moment of absolute meaninglessness, a thought might arise: **"If I have to die now, okay. Ready."**

This is not suicidal ideation in the clinical sense—it's the ego dissolving in the face of ultimate emptiness, the place where all constructed meaning falls away.

Maybe there are people who have never felt this. Maybe there are people who feel this very often. The teaching is not that everyone must go there, but that **for those who do, this is a sacred process, not a pathology**.

### Why We Keep Returning to Depression

**The reason we keep going constantly into depression is because we are so concerned with trying to get out of that situation, we lose all energy trying to make others feel fine.**

Think about this pattern:

You feel depressed → Others are uncomfortable with your depression → You try to make them comfortable → You use all your energy performing happiness → Depression deepens because you're not addressing it → Cycle repeats

**You don't put the energy on going to the depth. When I put all my intentions on going down to the depth of my soul, I find the reasons why I need this.**

The soul has its own wisdom. If it's pulling you into depression, there is a reason. Going deeper—touching the bottom—allows you to discover that reason instead of endlessly fighting the surface symptoms.

### Depression as Soul Integration

Here is the core spiritual teaching about depression:

**The soul needs depression in the same way the universe needs to integrate, and the body needs to sleep.**

Let that parallel settle:
- For the body: **waking and sleeping** are both necessary. Sleep is not failure; it's restoration.
- For the universe: **expression and integration** are both necessary. Integration is not stagnation; it's consolidation.
- For the soul: **expansion and depression** are both necessary. Depression is not dysfunction; it's deep rest.

**Depression allows the mind, soul, and body to integrate, to go within, to seek within the answers in the subconscious.**

If the mind, soul, and body are constantly doing many things, thinking about many things, using all their energy outwardly—eventually, one of these three will force a shutdown. It will **pull you into depression to make you sleep, to make you rest, to make you integrate**.

For the body: **To sleep and to wake is natural rhythm.**  
For the soul: **To de-press and to ex-press is natural rhythm.**  
For the spirit: **To breathe in and breathe out is natural rhythm.**

How would life be if we only exhaled? If we only expressed? If we only stayed awake?

### Depression Cannot Be Healed—Only Accompanied

This is perhaps the most important practical teaching:

**Depression can not be healed. Depression can only be something you accompany.**

Think of someone who is afraid of water. You don't take them away from the water. You don't remove all water from their life. **You teach that person to swim.** So next time they feel the pressure, they know how to move through it instead of drowning.

The same with depression: **Instead of trying to get out of it, become aware that you are losing the meaning of everything in order to give a new meaning.**

Depression is the destruction of old meaning-structures so new meaning can emerge. If you resist the destruction, you prevent the rebirth.

The role of helpers, therapists, friends, and family is not to **fix** the depressed person but to **accompany them through the darkness**, teaching them to swim in it, to breathe in it, to find their footing at the bottom.

### The Cultural Pressure to Change Depression

Our culture has enormous resistance to depression:

**We usually feel uncomfortable when people are feeling bad. We want for them to stop crying and smile.**

Why? Because **we relate sadness, depression, and these emotions as problems we want people to be happy for our own comfort.**

This creates a cultural pattern where:
- Depression is stigmatized as weakness or failure
- Depressed people are pressured to "get better" quickly
- Medication is often used to suppress symptoms without addressing root causes
- People hide their depression to avoid making others uncomfortable
- The depressed person feels guilt on top of depression for not being happy

The teaching invites a radical shift: **What if depression is not a problem to solve but a process to honor?**

### Accompanying Depression: Sitting With, Not Fixing

To accompany someone in depression means:

**Do not put your intention on changing what they are feeling.**  
If you try to change their depression for them, you polarize them against themselves—they will feel happy temporarily but tomorrow feel exactly the same or worse.

**Accompany the situation, do not try to change it.**  
Sit with them in the darkness. Let them know they are not alone. Do not try to pull them out; help them find what they need at the bottom.

**Be present without forcing transformation.**  
Your presence says: "I am here. You are safe to feel this. I am not afraid of your darkness."

This is much harder than giving advice. It requires:
- Tolerance for discomfort (yours and theirs)
- Trust in the soul's process
- Patience without timeline
- Presence without agenda

But this is what actually helps: **bearing witness to the darkness without trying to turn on the lights prematurely**.

## Practice: Tree of Life Root Integration—Finding Nutrients in the Wetland

This meditation guides you to the roots of the Tree of Life, where you lie in the mud and wetlands, finding nutrients in the darkness that will feed the seed of light within you.

### Steps

**1. Body Awareness**  
Take a deep breath. Focus on your breathing for several cycles.

Begin massaging your body from the crown toward the feet, touching each part. As you touch, remind your cells: "Everything I am doing is for your greatest good."

**2. Entering the Forest**  
Close your eyes. Visualize yourself in a beautiful forest—trees, birds, insects all around.

Begin walking deeper into the forest.

**3. The Rainforest Depths**  
As you walk, the forest becomes darker, denser—a rainforest. Continue deeper until you reach the darkest part.

**4. The Tree of Life**  
In the center, see the greatest and biggest tree of all—huge branches covering everything, leaves creating a canopy so thick that it seems like night below.

Yet hundreds of lights like stars (rays of sunlight) come through the leaves to the ground.

**5. Touching the Roots**  
Get close to this tree. Touch its roots at your side. Feel their texture, their strength.

**6. Lying Down in the Roots**  
Lie down between the roots, watching the sky above through the leaves.

Feel your feet and legs on the mud. Recognize: **it is here under the earth and water, in the wetlands, that I find the possibility to absorb the nutrients that nourish the seed of light that lives within me.**

**7. Being Swallowed by Mud**  
Feel the mud beginning to swallow your body—feet, legs, hips, torso, arms, shoulders. Only your face remains above the mud at first.

**8. Becoming a Root**  
Recognize: "I am becoming a root of this tree. I am part of the Tree of Life."

**9. Absorbing Nutrients**  
Feel yourself absorbing all the nutrients of this wetland—minerals, water, organic matter, the decomposed remains of all that has lived and died here.

This darkness, this mud, this bottom **contains everything you need to feed the seed within you**.

**10. Affirmation**  
Repeat: "I am the creator's emptiness. I am the creator's emptiness."

Recognize: "I absorb all the nutrients of this wetland. I am the mud. I am human."

**11. Complete Immersion**  
Now let the mud cover your face completely. Let yourself be fully swallowed, fully in the darkness.

**12. Finding Strength in Darkness**  
In this complete darkness, buried in the roots, affirm:

"These are the moments to look for inner strength. This darkness is not my enemy—it is my teacher. This pressure is not crushing me—it is forcing my seed to grow."

**13. Return**  
When you are ready, slowly bring awareness back to your physical body.

Feel your breath. Move gently.

Open your eyes, knowing you have touched the bottom and found what was there: nutrients for growth.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Honoring Darkness

If you're feeling any form of sadness, heaviness, or low energy today, do not try to immediately change it. Instead, sit with it for 10 minutes. Ask: "What is this trying to show me? What does my soul need right now?" Journal whatever arises without judgment.

### Weekly Focus: Accompanying Practice

If someone in your life is struggling this week, practice accompaniment instead of advice. Sit with them. Listen without trying to fix. Say: "I'm here. You're not alone. Take the time you need." Notice your own discomfort with their discomfort.

### Living the Teaching

This week, when you notice yourself trying to suppress difficult emotions or force positivity, pause. Ask: "Am I avoiding going deeper because I'm afraid of what I'll find at the bottom?" Give yourself permission to feel fully without rushing to resolution.

## Questions & Reflections

**Q: How do I know if my depression is "conscious" (soul-needed) versus clinical depression requiring professional help?**

If you can maintain basic functioning, have moments of clarity about the process, and can still access some inner resources, you may be in soul-process depression. If you cannot function, have persistent suicidal ideation, cannot see any meaning or hope, or the depression lasts months without relief—seek professional help. The teaching doesn't replace medical/therapeutic support; it provides spiritual context for the experience.

**Q: Isn't it dangerous to tell people depression is "needed" when depression kills people through suicide?**

The teaching distinguishes between accompanying depression as a process versus romanticizing or encouraging it. The message is: if you're in it, don't fight yourself; find what's at the bottom. But this doesn't mean "stay depressed forever." And it absolutely doesn't mean avoid treatment. Suicidal crisis requires immediate professional intervention.

**Q: How long should I stay in depression before trying to come out of it?**

There's no universal timeline. The soul will signal when it has found what it needed at the bottom. You'll feel a natural shift—not forced positivity, but genuine readiness to rise. Trust the process but also honestly assess: am I touching bottom, or am I stuck in a loop? The latter may need external support.

**Q: What if I can't afford to be depressed—I have responsibilities, children, work?**

The teaching acknowledges this reality. You can honor the soul's need for depth while maintaining necessary functioning. This might mean: therapy to process safely, micro-moments of sitting with darkness, honest communication with others about needing support, or temporary medication to stabilize while doing deeper work. The soul's needs and life's demands must be balanced practically.

**Q: How do I accompany someone in depression without becoming depressed myself?**

Maintain your own grounding practices. Presence doesn't mean merging with their darkness—it means witnessing it without being consumed. Set boundaries: "I can sit with you for this hour, then I need to tend to myself." You can't pour from an empty cup, but you also can't help by pretending the darkness isn't real.

**Q: What if someone in depression doesn't want to "touch the bottom" and just wants to feel better?**

Honor their choice. Not everyone is ready for depth work. Some people need stabilization first. You can offer: "I'm here if you want to explore what this is about, and I'm also here if you just need support getting through the day." Meet people where they are.

**Q: Can medication and spiritual understanding of depression coexist?**

Absolutely. Medication can provide stabilization that makes depth work possible. It can ease suffering enough to function while exploring meaning. The teaching offers context, not replacement for treatment. Some people need both chemical support and spiritual framework.

**Q: What's the difference between accompanying depression and enabling someone to stay stuck?**

Accompanying says: "I'm here as you move through this." Enabling says: "I'll help you avoid ever facing this." Accompanying supports the process; enabling prevents it. If someone has been in the same pattern for years without movement, they may need something more than accompaniment—perhaps professional intervention or honest confrontation.

## Closing Reflection

Today you have learned that depression is not your enemy, though it feels like one. It is the soul's way of pulling you down to the roots, to the bottom, to the mud where nutrients hide in darkness.

The culture will tell you to "get better quickly," to "think positive," to "just be happy." These voices come from discomfort with darkness, fear of depth, and misunderstanding of the soul's rhythms.

But you know better now: **the soul needs depression the way the body needs sleep**. It is rest, integration, going within to find answers the busy mind cannot access. It is de-pression after long ex-pression, breathing in after breathing out, the necessary downward movement before the upward leap.

When you touch the bottom—when everything loses meaning and nothing makes sense—you have not failed. You have arrived at the place where old meanings dissolve so new meanings can be born. This is the void, the emptiness, the wetland full of nutrients waiting to feed your seed.

Do not rush out of the darkness. Do not let others pull you prematurely into false light. Find what is at the bottom. Let the mud swallow you completely. Absorb the nutrients. Feel your roots growing deeper.

And when you have found what you came for—when the bottom gives you its teaching—you will rise naturally, not because someone forced you, but because you have touched ground and now have something to push against.

The seed of light within you needs the darkness of the mud to grow. This is not poetic metaphor—this is the truth of how transformation happens in matter, in soul, in cosmos.

Be patient with your darkness. Be gentle with your depth. And trust that when you are ready, when you have absorbed what the bottom offers, you will bloom again—not by avoiding the mud, but because you finally learned to extract its nutrients.

**Vibration:** True  
**Statement:** I am the creator's emptiness  
**Code:** Unconscious Integration

*When I become aware of the universe that I am, the hard process of placing the unconscious playing begins—the soul where all the uncontrollable attitudes are, the emotions, the inheritance from the past, the programming of the species, the race, culture, and family. I must integrate my past and my present for being free from them in reality, learn how to use them as tools. These are the moments to look for inner strength.*
