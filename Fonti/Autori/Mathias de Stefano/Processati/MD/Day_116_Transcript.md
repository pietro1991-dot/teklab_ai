## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning , Dr. Numbriking. To all of you.

So there 's a waiting today , so this is why I had to move. But there 's another waiting behind.

So I know you can hear it. Maybe you will listen to some music.

Today , internet is going very , very bad.

## Q&A

So I asked for patience.

So in Egypt , there 's no connection by cable to the internet.

So everything is by Wi-Fi.

So that 's what we have. Try to put the video in the lower quality. And maybe you will receive the better sign. Sign.

So today we are in the second chara , doing the physical week in the month of Scorpio.

Remember that we are not following the astrological calendars. That we are here following the Atlantic calendar for inner work.

So I hope that you were able to read the block today. Or if you did n't maybe lay turns , you have a support writing , the writing.

So one of the main things that I wanted to say before we start about what I wrote is that all the examples and all the things that I write in there is kind of an out analysis.

So for them to help you to make your own questions. And also , I know that sometimes maybe it 's like weird to hear someone that works for the consciousness saying that he thinks that it 's not that whatever I am doing. I am doing this is not worth it or something like that. But what I get is that for me is very important to be sincere , to really express what I have been feeling.

And yeah , so I guess it 's important to share that to hear about this. It 's for example that I sometimes may write about things that makes me feel uncomfortable , like for example , maybe I would say I can stand humans. Yes , I ca n't stand humans. And that 's what I feel.

And what I feel is not what it really is , is a perception from the inside.

So this is why in the scripts I work myself to try to understand why am I feeling that of the outside. Why am I receiving this? What is within me that makes me perceive that in that way?

Okay , so do n't take , do n't take all the inner process that I am showing , like literally , okay , because when I am describing about emotions , I am just talking about emotions. And they are just a perception from within.

So related to this is important to understand that everything that you may perceive from the outside , that you may feel that something , or something that makes you feel bad , emotion that you perceive from the point of view of the inside.

So that 's why we have to work with it. And related to this , we go to the top of the day which is depression.

So as I am trying to be aligned with all the processes that we are doing in order to explain about each issue.

So the reason why I wrote about depression today is because I was feeling that depression today.

So I could be more aligned with the matter to talk about. And this is because of course , if I would be here talking about depression , but jumping around and making jokes , there would be weird. And we are speaking about people that are feeling bad and depressed. When we usually do , to try to stop the other person to be feeling like this , like , we want for people to feel happy , because we feel comfortable.

What I was saying is that we usually feel uncomfortable when people are feeling bad. And we want for them to stop crying and smile and we say , stop crying and everything is going to be okay.

So that 's why we usually do n't want for people to feel bad.

So what we do in our life is trying to relate sadness , depression and we issue with all this , emotions , we want for people to be happy. We usually do n't want to speak about feeling bad.

So what we usually do is that we speak about depression , giving advice to others , once you are feeling fine , the person that is feeling perfectly that says , oh , you have to do this and that and it 's perfect. And you will get away from that situation perfectly. And you give advice being happy. But we do n't usually do is to speak about these emotions from being within those emotions , from within.

We usually speak about these emotions from outside and not from what you feel being in that state. The thing that happened , usually is that , when we get into this situations of depression , we start to , we start to see everything like , if you know , you hold self , it 's not willing to. To understand it. You do n't want to understand it.

And this feeling of being inside that darkness , it makes me feel that it really means. There are some moments when in that depression , even if you know , mean , you find the sense of things , not to give , like if you rather feel the pressed , then have it a meaning.

So in that moment , it 's when we can find two different ways of depression. One , the one is the one that pushes from the outside towards us and the other one. Is the one that is pushed by us from the within. The depression means to set up pressure , depression , pressure that pushes us down.

The outside is when we feel the pressure of the world of the people around them. And this is the one that we should call the unconscious depression. The unconscious depression would be the one from the outside because unconscious needs for polarity. It needs polarity to create someone to blame of why you feel like that.

Okay , so you blame someone because you , or something , because you are like this.

So the unconscious , the unconscious , the unconscious , that there are four , this is from the outside , pushing me down. Four says that I can blame for what is happening to me. And then we have the other depression , which is the conscious depression. And then we have this conscious depression.

And the conscious depression would be the one when you recognize that there is no other. That there is no other people because everything is one. And when you recognize that everything is one.

So you are the only one responsible for the place where you are. For this position on being depressed is only you. We may think that to be conscious that being conscious , you can not be depressed because to be conscious is like to be happy to be fine. But it 's not like that because consciousness is to be aware of what you feel , why you feel it.

There 's not to be enlightened to be conscious is to be aware of the things that you are feeling that you are. The conscious depression is very different from the unconscious depression because this is the depression that you need that you 're willing to feel that you need to perceive.

So I said this emotion , the depression is something that somehow first of all. I want to feel this. I want this , I want to feel comfortable in this situation like that. And it 's very annoying when people say to you in that situation , you 're going to be better.

You have to get outside from that. You have to feel happy. Do n't worry , this will end. I do n't know if it happened to you , but it 's kind of annoying.

And one of the things that happens to us is that somehow we need to touch the bottom of the darkness. I was so needs to touch the bottom. Otherwise it feels like if it kind of breath because it is not making it 's not able to put feet before it jumps and goes up again.

So we have an outer culture from the unconscious , same to us. This is a cycle. You have to go on. You have to move.

You have to transform it. Because this will keep going. And you will be able to do it. You can do it.

So the culture , all this random is trying to take you out.

So you feel free from that situation , from that emotion. But there is another part that says , yes , I know that I am going to make a cycle to go to move forward. But I need to touch the ground. I need to go deeper.

And when I touch the bottom of it , everything loose meaning. And when you touch the bottom of the things , it 's horrible. Because everything loose meaning. Everything just does n't have any meaning and it 's sensed.

It 's horrible. And there is a moment in that situation that nothing has meaning at all.

So we start to stop feeling everything. I need anything else. I need to touch from everything. And suddenly you just say , if I have to die now , okay.

And ready.

So maybe there are people that have never felt this. And maybe there is there is people that feels this very often.

The reason why we keep going constantly with this is because it 's because we are so concerned on trying to get out of that situation. To lose all the energy. On trying to make the rest feeling fine. And you do n't put the energy on going to the depth.

When I put all my intentions on going down to the depth of my soul , I find the reasons why I need this.

The reasons why I am feeling like that. The soul needs depression in the same way as the universe needs to integrate. And the body needs to sleep.

So it can wake up in the next day.

So the reason why we sometimes need to feel this is because the mind and the soul. The three of them are willing to integrate and to go within and to seek within the answers and the subconscious. If the mind and the soul , the body , the soul and the body and the mind and the body. If two of the three of these are trying to use all the energy and doing many things and trying to think about a lot of things and doing.

Finally , one of these three bodies will try to get into depression to sleep. To rest. To sleep and to wake up is for the body. The same thing as for the soul is to press and to express.

## Guided Meditation

The same thing that for the spirit is to breathe in and breathe out. How life would be if we only exile , if we only express , if we only wake up.

So depression can not be healed. Depression can only be something you , how do you say it , you help with a company. Yeah , sorry.

So depression is something you can only accompany.

So someone that is afraid of water , you do n't take them from the water. You teach that person to swim.

## Daily Practice Elements

So next time , if you feel the pressure , if you feel press , instead of trying to get out of it , just be aware that you are losing the meaning of everything in order to give a new meaning. The vibration for today is true. The statement for today is , I am the creator 's emptiness. The goal for today is unconscious integration.

And when I become aware of the universe that I am , the heart process of placing the unconscious playing begins. The soul , where all the uncontrollable attitudes are , the emotions , the inheritance from the past , the programming of the species , the race , culture and family. I must integrate my past and my present for being free from them in reality , learn how to use them as tools.

So remember , these are the moments to look for the inner strength.

So remember that next time , when you feel the press or when you see someone that is feeling depressed , do n't put your intention on changing , changing , changing , what I am feeling now for example myself. Because otherwise , I would be polarized in myself. Feeling happy now , but tomorrow I will feel again exactly the same.

So that 's why we have to accompany this situation , not to try to change it. Let 's go to the alignment. I focus in my rating. I 'm going to try to change the situation.

## Energy Work

I 'm going to change the situation. I 'm going to change the situation. And I take my hands to my head and softly I start to massage. From the crown , each part of the body towards the feet.
