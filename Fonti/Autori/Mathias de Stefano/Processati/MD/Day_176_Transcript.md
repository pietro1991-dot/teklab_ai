## Introduction

Hello everybody , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening everyone. I hope all of you have been able to listen to me.

So today is 26 January 26th and in today 's 28th will be the full moon of this month which is in Leo and this moon represents like a very heavy tension which is the worst tension in the whole year of 2021.

So will be the 28th will be the full moon Leo and that would be like a very heavy tension in this sky for the whole year. Because of this I posted in my Instagram in just so you read. I posted there a video in Spanish and soon will be a video in English explaining the idea of what is , it 's not me , it 's Mercedes who is explaining this from the astrology point of view what this information means , what that day means.

So we know how to handle it when we arrive to that day.

So it 's a very heavy day.

So I I recommend you to take benefit of it and I already did it because of course I am a virginia student.

So I did it before and as a great , a great Leo example , I did it in front of 4,000 people , live streaming a few days ago as I was crying all my Leo shit from within with all of you.

So with the public of thousands of people.

So that 's the way Leo does kettarsis.

So I would recommend you to see this videos in the Instagram.

So you know how to handle this energy.

So once at this we go to the topic for today related to the scrum chara in the Capricorn physical week , which is the topic of culture.

Today I wrote a lot about what culture is.

So as always I recommend you to go to the blog to read the blog and to see a little bit more of what culture means.

So let 's go into the topic of culture because for us today , a culture is something that we usually relate with the conjunction of history traditions , knowledge and art of a group of people in a certain place in a certain time.

So but that way of seeing what is a culture is really new. Because it 's been like from the 20th century that we call culture to that conjunction of attributes of one , one , group of people. But before that what it really meant , it was how the people used to live the cycles of time. That 's what really meant culture.

How people lived the cycles of time.

So that 's what we are going to explain. Culture from where the concept of culture comes. Because sometimes we used to describe the person that has a lot of culture as someone that is cultivated like we describe the cultures in the fields.

So the relationship that we used to do is that a person is cultivated a lot of knowledge within.

So it has a lot of fruits within. That 's what it would mean.

So it represents the person that is growing a lot of information inside that harvest a lot of knowledge from the outside.

So that 's what the concept of cultivated person means. But the word cultivated , the word called culture cultural culture comes exactly from that from the harvest in the fields.

So that 's what it really means. It comes from the agriculture , from the people that is cultivating. That 's why we call it ivory culture. But the word culture comes from the concept of seeding , so-ins , growing and harvesting.

This process , this entire process , is something that describes the cycles of the fields , the cycles of the seasons.

So it , the seasons will change , telling us what is what we have to show or harvest in that month.

So that 's why the concept of cultural comes from the in the European language that we call the Delle. Delle means to move to another home to move on.

So that 's the word Delle.

So Delle is to move from one house to another to an inhabited and new house. And this relationship that we have with the word is because the people in the fields needed to harvest or needed to.

So according to where the stars are.

So we started to call the different stars like houses.

So there 's the house of Leo , the house of Virgo , the house of Santa of Libre.

So we have all this different houses.

So according to the house we are moving in in each part of the year , we know what we have to do in the fields.

So that 's why the cult debate , to make the cultivation , I do n't know what to say , to sow the plants , to grow the plants , to harvest the plants , all of that was related to the moving on of the astrological chart.

Sorry , astrological houses in the sky. And that created the concept of the cycles.

So that 's why cult is related to the cycles that repeat themselves in order to have food.

So as you see and as we have been speaking all this time , everything that we do is related with food because we are animals and we need to eat.

So because we need to eat , everything that we started to create is related with food.

Remember that we were creating our civilizations as sedentary people because we understood how to harvest , how to sow.

So because of this , we started to understand the skies. We started to understand the cycles of the sow in and harvesting and so on. And we started to have specific dates where we could know exactly when was the moment to sow , when was the moment to harvest and so on.

So because of this , because of this we created celebrations. These celebrations had these ceremonies.

Remember the word ceremony which is harvest. It comes from the agriculture god.

So the ceremony and by the ceremonies we create traditions because this repeats every season in every year.

So they started to repeat. And this is how we started to create the cultures.

So all the cultures of the world are related to what we eat , to what , to the agriculture.

## Q&A

So the word called that we also used to come from the same origin. And why is this? Because remember , the people in the past used to say , in order to have food in order to have things for us , we need to ask help to the gods.

So a lot of people started to have this opportunity of not only surviving by the food , but they started to think and to feel.

So they started to cultivate their souls. And when they started to think about the cultivating their souls , they said , so we have to honor the invisible ones that allows for everything to exist. They allowed to the matter to exist.

So they started to to honor them. And now remember that cult is not related with an culture and cultivate. Culture is not related with to honor divine divinity or to cultivate the plants. The word called comes from coming from one home to another , changing houses , that 's the origin of the word.

So that 's why when we have to sow , we have to honor the goddess of sowing. When we have to grow , we have to honor the divinity of growing. When we have to harvest , we have to honor the divinity of harvesting.

So that 's why remembered celebration which is to honor the agriculture. That 's the origin of the word celebration.

Sorry , ceremony.

So that 's why the origin of the word is a cycle that repeats going from one home to another.

So this is why when you honor the god that allows the sowing in the fields , you relate culture with cult because both of them are the same. Both of them are telling you we are moving on from one house to another. Cycles of time in the year. E.

C. To understand , I guess.

So it 's important to understand this relationship of how this starts to be created. That in the ancient times , the gods and goddesses were not divine things that were away in the conceptual , sorry , in the magical realm and so on. No , they were aligned to the natural world because they were connected to the idea of the nature.

So every one of the gods was just an attribute of the cycles of the nature. This is how the gods had this human emotions and they were living like human stories with different attributes , with different tools and so on because each one of the gods were a conceptual representation of what was happening in their cycle of earth. That 's why the life of earth and life of the gods were so similar because they are almost the same.

So because of this is that the cultivation and the cult is exactly related , it 's perfectly related. In the middle we created the ceremony , the ceremonies to celebrate the cultivation , the cultures. And because of this relationship is how we created the cultures through the ceremonies. Perfect.

Once the people got to manage the food , this means that people were able to survive and they were not fighting for food all the time and they created a system called civilization to ensure the continuity of eating basically.

So people started to be relaxed and they were able to think instead of just working hard in order to get food.

So this allowed the moment of relaxation.

Remember , scholar , is the moment of enjoying just relaxing and thinking because you do n't have to fight for survival.

So because of civilization , here comes the people that starts to think the world in a different way because they do n't have to fight for life. And they start to see that maybe the gods are not the ones that are allowing us to survive. Maybe it 's just the way in which we humans have been able to design ways to manifest , to create. Because of this is that these people started to way to look for different ways to cultivate their souls , not following the gods , but following the knowledge that were with them.

And that 's what we call to cultivate the soul , to cultivate the spirit. These people used the idea of the cultures , the fields , of the farmers , but for their souls and they were the philosophers.

So the philosophers were these people that had all this time to think about because they do n't have to take care of food. And they understood that their bodies were the terrain , the fields. Their soul was the water to be poured on the body. And the spirit was the seed that must grow in ourselves.

So from this philosophical point of view , let 's try to understand how this works. The spirit is a seed. Inside the seed , there is all the information. It 's like every seed has the potential of becoming a tree , but it does n't become a tree unless it has the help of the emotion of the water.

With the water , the seed awakens it potential , expanding itself through the emotion that allows the seed to terminate.

## Energy Work

So this expansion of the seed is not enough because in order for the seed to become a tree , when it expands emotionally , it needs to take roots to absorb the minerals , able to create the plant.

So the minerals like phosphorus , nitrogen , calcium , silicium , iron , all of this is in earth. All this information is on earth.

So the water helps the seed to expand. And by this expansion , it goes down to look for these minerals in the body. And that 's how the tree can exist. The tree can expand and create flowers and fruits.

## Practice Structure

So it 's impossible for the spirit. Even if it has the whole potential of the whole tree to leave what is possible for it unless it does n't leave the emotion of the soul and the structure of the body. It 's because of the soul and the body that its spirits can expand its potential at become and become a tree. Following this idea , remember that you are three things.

You are a body , a soul and a spirit.

So this means that you have a terrain. You have a land , which is the body. Within you , you have the water and within the water , you have the seed.

## Energy Work

So that seed has the potential of the whole tree that you might become. But to do the tree , to make the tree , you need to balance the water because as a huge amount of water can kill the seed. But when you just balance the water , you have the seed to grow , to expand , to take roots and where are going those roots in order to grow. It kind of go just flying around the spiritual beings in the middle of nowhere.

In order for the tree of life of who I am , to exist , we need to take roots on the ground and that ground is the body.

So we need a firm land. We need to take care of our bodies in order to manifest where we are.

So now what? There has been some people that allows the seed to expand.

So those people that God to expand the seed , create the tree , so gave fruits and were able to what? To awake its technology as we spoke yesterday. The technology is this beauty , this art that comes from the spirit , able to be manifested and share with others outside.

So for example , when these people expand the tree and gives the fruit , share the fruit , it starts to create a culture because it 's cultivating.

So for example , when we are doing here , every day is creating a culture. Why? Because it 's a cycle that repeats once again , in which I am sharing some of my fruits that we then share with everyone and for sure , everyone that is here.

Sometimes you do n't even have to think about seeding a 2020 at 8 Px to see this. It gets normalized. You get to know what is coming in the next day.

So that 's created a culture at tradition.

So by this concept , constantly , once and again , once and again , this tree gives the fruits , but then it creates also seeds. And this seeds grows again as new trees. And this tree gives new fruits and creates more trees.

So suddenly starts to repeat so so much that the first tree is not even remembered because nobody knows what was the first tree. Suddenly , all of them became the tree. And that 's why a culture is alive.

So a culture , a live culture , is born in the moment when the rest of the people is not eating just for one tree , but each one of them have become a tree by itself.

So they interact in between one another , sharing the fruits.

So what happened here? When this culture starts to grow and expand and expand and suddenly , it takes the terrain of many others. These trees that only absorb one of those elements or minerals start to kill the land because there are a lot of other elements in nature that they are not being absorbed.

So they start to kill the terrain. And because of this , when there is a culture that eats other cultures , making them by force to become like them , that starts to kill the terrain. And eventually it will kill the same culture.

So when we have a monocultive , which is only one culture , what happens is that they are using so much the same terrain that it absorbs all the nutrients of that terrain. And there is no cycles.

So that starts to kill the land. And when it 's only one , so it starts to create a desert. The same thing happened when one only culture tries to put over the other ones and kill the other ones. When that happens , when that happens , that culture is not only killing the other cultures , but it 's killing itself eventually.

This is because when you have a flat terrain , there is no possibility to make anything grow because when it comes , a lot of water just pours around and goes away. And when it comes the wind , the seeds just fly away with the minerals.

So it 's impossible to make something to grow.

So that 's why you need a terrain that is curved.

So in that curvature , the water can pure. The seeds can be imaging the the crats. The minerals can stare there.

So that 's how this terrain starts to be able to create a lot of a lot of life.

So this means that a terrain must be flexible. There 's a boat with music passing by.

Okay , so the diversity.

So a land that is corrugated , a land that is like this , helps many other plants to grow to allow the land to be more rich.

So that 's why many cultures , many cultures we have is like having a lot of plants.

So there is diversity. And as many cultures we have in this world , the best for the earth.

So remember that the goal of all of all of this is for the spirit to awaken its potential to find what is capable of.

So if we are all trying to do exactly the same thing , we are losing the opportunity to allow many options to exist.

So this is why we need to we need a world with a lot of cultures.

So the key for today is basically to recognize that we should not be this this only culture , only way of thinking like being all spiritual , all aware and that 's the goal. No , the goal is diversity. As much diversity we have in our planet , the best we will get to understand the potentially of the spirit.

So that 's why that this is an invitation to be open like the terrain with many different flexibilities in order to accept diversity to assimilate many other ways of understanding ourselves.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's tourism ourselves from the cultures that the spirit has created. Let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is due. The statement for today is I am the essence of the mother matrix.

The code for today is nitrogen. The 78 % of the atmospheric gas is composed of the basic element. It 's one of the most important basis for life. In Greek it means generator of salt.

And has the very important function of flourishing the elemental world of recitals. Recitals. The high consumption consumption of this chemical makes plants grow faster and big , which at the same time helps the development of all beings that live from plants and that ca n't naturally process nitrogen from the environment.

So it 's related to what we have been speaking.

So let 's go to the alignment. It 's come for trouble. Close your eyes. Pay attention to your breathing.

As you start to make a soft massage to all your body. I become aware of all my body. My pain attention to my feet. My legs hands and arms.

My chest , back and waist. Neck and head. Realizing that my entire body is a seed on earth. I recognize the deceit that I am.

As we 've been the potential of the whole world , the entire planet , the tree of life. It 's encoded in the spirit and the will of become the creator , the mother , the matrix. The true human emptiness is granted. .

. Taking you into account the morals that the sacred human can be written through your mind The minerals and emotions. I recognize that within my body I can feel the oceans , the seas , the rivers , all of them in my blood. In my veins.

I can feel within me the waves of the Indian ocean , the Atlantic ocean , the Pacific ocean , surrounded my body from within and towards my feet in the south. I filled in the Atlantic ocean as above in my head , the Arctic ocean. I can feel that Atlantic ocean moving from north to south in front of my body. I can feel the Pacific ocean moving behind in my back from north to south.

In the Indian ocean expressed in both sides of my kidneys. I can feel Europe and the height of my heart from the neck to the chest. Africa below by the chest to the stomach , the genitals and the other side North America. It starts in my head , in my throat , coming down to South America , ending in my feet.

On the back I filled entire continent of Asia and below surrounding my hips and waist , oceania , as below of my body I filled in Antarctica and in my nose the fresh air of Greenland. And now I can feel every culture in this body. I can perceive every religion , every race , ethnicities , every tradition , philosophy. All of them as the attributes of this seed of the world that I am.

Everyone connected to the great Mother Tree. Through my singing I activate the potential of my own culture of the earth that I am. I am the essence of the Mother Matrix. I am the essence of the Mother Matrix.

I am the essence of the Mother Matrix. I am the seed of the great world , the great tree. I am the culture of my spirit. Take a deep breath and I recognize every culture lives within me.

So to awaken the potential , the lives in me , I have to open myself to all the cultures of the world. I am the culture. Take a deep breath and start to expand this consciousness throughout all the body. My carries and stretching and warning.

Coming back here and now each one at its own time. Thank you everybody for being here and as always see you tomorrow at the same time. Thank you.
