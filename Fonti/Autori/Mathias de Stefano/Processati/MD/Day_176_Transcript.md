## Overview

Today marks Day 176 of our journey, connecting with the sacral chakra during the mental week of Aquarius, focusing on the profound concept of culture. This teaching arrives during a significant astrological moment—January 26th, just two days before the full moon in Leo on January 28th, which represents the most intense tension in the sky for all of 2021. This cosmic backdrop reminds us that we are always moving through cycles, and understanding these cycles is the very essence of what culture truly means.

The modern understanding of culture—as a collection of history, traditions, knowledge, and art of a group of people—is actually quite recent, emerging only in the 20th century. Before this, culture had a much more direct and visceral meaning: it was about how people lived the cycles of time. It was about knowing when to plant, when to harvest, when to celebrate, and when to prepare. Culture was not abstract; it was survival woven into the rhythm of the cosmos.

When we speak of someone being "cultivated," we use agricultural language—a person who has grown knowledge within, who has harvested information from the outside world and bears fruit internally. This is no coincidence. The word culture comes directly from the fields, from agriculture, from the sacred act of seeding, growing, and harvesting. And all of this was guided by the stars, by the movement through astrological houses, which told our ancestors exactly what needed to be done and when.

Today's teaching will take us deep into the etymology and spiritual significance of culture, showing us that everything we've created as civilizations—our languages, religions, philosophies, and social structures—stems from our relationship with food, with the earth, and with the cycles of time that govern all life.

## Core Teaching

### The True Origin of Culture

The word **culture** comes from the concept of **seeding, sowing, growing, and harvesting**. This entire process describes the cycles of the fields and the cycles of the seasons. As the seasons change, they tell us what we have to sow or harvest in that particular month. This is why the concept of culture comes from the European language word **"delle"**.

**Delle** means "to move to another home, to move on." It refers to moving from one house to another, to an inhabited and new house. This relationship exists because the people working in the fields needed to harvest according to where the stars were positioned. We started to call the different stars "houses"—the house of Leo, the house of Virgo, the house of Libra, and so on through all the zodiac signs.

According to the house we are moving through in each part of the year, we know what we have to do in the fields. That's why **cultivation**—to sow the plants, to grow the plants, to harvest the plants—was all related to the moving on of the astrological houses in the sky. This created the concept of cycles that repeat themselves in order to have food.

### Culture and the Need to Eat

As we've been exploring throughout this entire journey, everything that we do is related to food because we are animals and we need to eat. Because we need to eat, everything that we started to create as civilizations is related with food. Remember that we became sedentary people because we understood how to harvest, how to sow.

Because of this understanding, we started to comprehend the skies. We began to understand the cycles of sowing and harvesting. We started to have specific dates where we could know exactly when was the moment to sow, when was the moment to harvest, and so on.

Because of this knowledge, we created **celebrations**. These celebrations had **ceremonies**. Remember, the word ceremony comes from the agriculture god—it is related to harvest. Through these ceremonies, we created **traditions**, because these celebrations repeated every season, every year.

This is how we started to create cultures. **All the cultures of the world are related to what we eat, to agriculture.** The word "cult" that we also use comes from the same origin.

### The Connection Between Cult and Culture

Why are cult and culture connected? Because remember, the people in the past used to say, "In order to have food, in order to have things for us, we need to ask help from the gods." Many people who started to have the opportunity of not only surviving by food began to think and to feel. They started to **cultivate their souls**.

When they started to think about cultivating their souls, they said, "We have to honor the invisible ones that allow everything to exist. They allow the matter to exist." So they started to honor them.

Now remember: **cult is not just related to honoring divinity or to cultivating plants. The word cult comes from moving from one home to another, changing houses—that's the origin of the word.** That's why when we have to sow, we have to honor the goddess of sowing. When we have to grow, we have to honor the divinity of growing. When we have to harvest, we have to honor the divinity of harvesting.

That's why **ceremony** (which is to honor agriculture) has the same root. The origin of the word is a cycle that repeats, going from one house to another.

### The Divine Aligned with Nature

This is why, when you honor the god that allows the sowing in the fields, you relate culture with cult—because both of them are the same. Both are telling you we are moving on from one house to another, following the cycles of time in the year.

In ancient times, the gods and goddesses were not divine things that were away in some conceptual, magical realm. No, they were aligned to the natural world because they were connected to the idea of nature.

**Every one of the gods was just an attribute of the cycles of nature.** This is how the gods had human emotions and were living like human stories with different attributes, with different tools—because each one of the gods was a conceptual representation of what was happening in the cycle of earth.

That's why the life of earth and the life of the gods were so similar—because they are almost the same. Because of this relationship, the cultivation and the cult are exactly related, perfectly related.

In the middle, we created the **ceremony**—the ceremonies to celebrate the cultivation, the cultures. And because of this relationship is how we created the cultures through the ceremonies.

### When Survival Became Civilization

Once the people managed to control food—meaning people were able to survive and they were not fighting for food all the time—they created a system called **civilization** to ensure the continuity of eating, basically.

When this happened, when food was ensured, people started to have time. They had time to think, to feel, to create. They didn't have to spend every waking moment hunting or gathering or protecting themselves. This is when culture as we think of it today began to emerge—art, philosophy, complex religions, written language.

But all of it, every single piece of what we call civilization, rests on that foundation: **the understanding of cycles, the ability to work with the earth and the stars to ensure food.** Culture is not separate from this. Culture IS this.

## Practice

### Connecting to the Cycles

Today's practice is about recognizing yourself as part of the eternal cycles that created all culture. You are not separate from the seasons, from the stars, from the ancient rhythms that governed your ancestors' lives.

**Step 1: Ground in Your Body**  
Sit or stand comfortably. Place your hands on your sacral chakra (below the navel). This is the portal of creation, the place where you connect to the cycles of fertility, growth, and harvest—both literal and metaphorical.

**Step 2: Acknowledge the Cycle**  
Speak aloud or internally: "I am part of the cycles of time. My ancestors learned to read the stars, to plant by the moon, to harvest by the sun. This knowledge lives in my body. This wisdom flows through my blood."

**Step 3: Recognize Your Culture**  
Think about the food you eat. Where does it come from? What season are you in? What is growing, what is dormant? Recognize that every meal you eat connects you to the same cycles that created the concept of culture thousands of years ago.

**Step 4: Honor the Houses**  
Visualize yourself moving through astrological houses. See yourself passing from Leo to Virgo, from one cosmic home to another. With each passage, you know what to do. You are guided. You are not lost in the expansion of the universe—you have patterns, you have structure.

**Step 5: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"My"** three times. Feel it resonate in your sacral chakra.  
Then speak the statement: **"I Am the Portal of Creation."**  
You are the doorway through which the ancient cycles continue. You are the continuation of culture.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Track the Cycle You're In:**  
Today, research what agricultural season you are currently in based on your location. Are you in a planting season, a growing season, a harvest season, or a dormant season? What foods are naturally available in your region right now?

Write down what you discover. Reflect on how disconnected modern life has become from these cycles—we can eat strawberries in winter, corn in spring, anything anytime. What have we lost? What have we gained?

**Honor a Meal:**  
At one meal today, before you eat, pause. Speak a simple acknowledgment: "Thank you to the cycles that brought this food. Thank you to the earth, the sun, the rain, the seasons. I am part of this cycle."

This is not religious—this is cultural in the truest sense. You are recognizing your place in the pattern.

### Applying This Teaching

Culture is not something you consume or learn about—it's something you live. When you align yourself with natural cycles, you are practicing culture. When you eat seasonal food, celebrate the solstices, recognize the phases of the moon, you are participating in the same patterns that created every civilization on earth.

You don't need to belong to a specific tradition or ethnicity to be cultural. You need to belong to the earth, to the cycles, to the patterns that govern all life. This is universal culture—the culture of being human on this planet.

As you move through the coming days, begin to notice: What cycles govern your life? Work cycles, sleep cycles, moon cycles, seasonal cycles? Are you fighting them or flowing with them? Are you creating your own ceremonies to mark the passages?

You are not separate from culture. You ARE culture manifesting through time.

## Aquarius Mental Week Context

We are in the mental week of Aquarius, learning to think in new ways, to break old mental patterns. Understanding culture in this original way—as cycles and movement through cosmic houses rather than static traditions—is exactly this kind of mental shift.

Aquarius asks us to see the patterns, to recognize the networks, to understand that we are all connected through these ancient rhythms. The sacral chakra today (My - I Am the Portal of Creation) reminds us that we don't just think about these cycles—we create through them, we birth through them, we continue them.

This week is teaching us to use our minds not to separate ourselves from nature, but to recognize the intelligent design of natural patterns and align with them consciously. Culture is one of those patterns—and you are a living expression of it.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: If culture comes from agricultural cycles, what happens when humans become disconnected from the land?

We lose the root meaning of culture and start to see it as something external—traditions to preserve, art to consume, history to study. But true culture is lived, not observed. When we disconnect from the land, we lose the rhythm, the pattern. We start to feel rootless, without identity, searching for "my culture" when in fact, the deepest culture is simply being human on earth, aligned with seasons and cycles.

### Q: Why did ancient people see gods and goddesses as attributes of nature rather than separate divine beings?

Because they understood that divinity IS nature. When you plant a seed and it grows, there is magic in that—real, observable magic. The force that makes the seed become the tree, that's divine. So they honored it, named it, created stories about it. The gods weren't separate from the process; they WERE the process, personified so humans could relate to them, honor them, work with them.

### Q: How can I create personal ceremonies in modern life?

Start by recognizing the cycles you already live—the new moon, the full moon, the equinoxes, the solstices, even the weekly rhythm. Choose one cycle and mark it. Light a candle on the new moon and set intentions. Celebrate the spring equinox by planting seeds. Create a harvest ceremony in autumn where you acknowledge what you've "harvested" in your life that year. It doesn't have to be elaborate. Ceremony is simply conscious attention to pattern.

### Q: What's the relationship between cult and culture?

They are the same word with the same root: "delle," meaning to move from one house to another. Both refer to the cycles of time and the movement through astrological houses. Cult is honoring the divine forces that govern those cycles. Culture is living within those cycles, creating traditions around them. When you honor the goddess of spring planting, that's cult. When you plant in spring because that's what the cycle requires, that's culture. They're inseparable.

### Q: If all civilization is based on ensuring food, what does that mean for spiritual practice?

It means spirituality is not separate from survival—it grew FROM survival. When we had food handled, we had time to think, to feel, to create, to honor the divine. But we can't skip the foundation. A spiritual practice disconnected from the body's needs, from the earth's cycles, from the basic truth that we are animals who need to eat—that's not transcendence, that's dissociation. True spirituality includes the earth, works with it, honors it.

### Q: How does understanding culture as cycles help me in daily life?

It gives you permission to move, to change, to cycle through different phases. You're not supposed to be the same all the time—you're supposed to be like the seasons. Sometimes planting, sometimes growing, sometimes harvesting, sometimes resting in winter. When you fight these cycles, you suffer. When you work with them, you flow. Understanding this is the essence of wisdom.

### Q: What is the significance of the sacral chakra for culture?

The sacral chakra is the portal of creation, the womb, the place where new life emerges. Culture is created—it's not static, it's not dead history. Every generation creates culture by living the cycles in their own way. The sacral chakra reminds us that we are creators of culture, not just inheritors. We continue the pattern, but we also add to it, adapt it, birth new expressions of the eternal cycle.
