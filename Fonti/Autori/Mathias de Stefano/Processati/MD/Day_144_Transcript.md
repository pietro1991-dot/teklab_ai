## Overview

On this special day, December 25th, we explore the true meaning of this date—not as the literal birth of Jesus, but as the ancient celebration of the winter solstice and the resurrection of the sun. We examine how this day represents the moment when the sun begins its return to the northern hemisphere after three days of stillness.

More importantly, we journey into the heart of the planet: Europe. Not as a political entity or collection of nations, but as the beating heart of the world—the continent that has absorbed and pumped energy, culture, philosophy, and influence throughout human history. We explore how Europe's history of imperialism and colonialism reflects humanity's struggle with unconditional love, and how healing the heart of the world begins with healing our own hearts.

Today's vibration is "THi," combining the celestial with the heart. The statement "I Am the Axis of Heaven" reminds us that we are the balance point between light and shadow, between giving and receiving love. The color gray represents this balance—neither pure light nor absolute darkness, but the acknowledgment that both are the same thing vibrating at different frequencies.

## Core Teaching

### The Truth About December 25th

For some of you, today you celebrate Christmas. The day December 25th is not related to the birth of Christ, of Jesus. It is related to the solstice—the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, which was December 21st.

Remember that this week, what we celebrate is the moment when the sun stays for three days in the same spot and then starts to move back again towards the north. The planet is divided into the equator, the northern hemisphere, and the southern hemisphere, and they will always be opposite in seasons. When we have summer in the north, it is winter in the south. When we have spring in the north, it is autumn in the south.

### The Crucifixion of Time

This movement of the planet that brings the four seasons is divided into four stages of three months each—the four seasons with three months, making the 12 months total, which is the solar year. **This is what we call the crucifixion of time: equinox and solstice.**

Equinox means there is a kind of balance in the planet. Both places are equal in the axis. Autumn and spring are this balance that we have. Remember, equinox comes from the word "equal"—it means to be equal.

The other line, the solstice (winter and summer), means the moment when the sun stays. "Sun stays" is "solstice" in Latin. That's why we call it the two solstices. The solstice and equinox represent the four cycles, which is the crucifixion.

### The Sun as Symbol of the Divine

This crucifixion represents the four perceptions of the sun, not the earth. From our point of view living on the earth, we look at the sun like it is moving, but the sun is not moving. It's us, the earth, who is moving. That's why we perceive that the sun is moving from different positions in the horizon.

The solstice and equinox are related to the sun. **This is the symbol that is crucified.** This cross in the past was designed like a cross and a circle in the center, representing the sun—the four positions of the sun along the year.

### Understanding the Winter Solstice

What is the solstice? The solstice is that moment when the sun stays. How can the sun stay? The earth is moving. The planet is moving constantly in this position. The sun is always in the same spot. When the earth moves like this, it seems like the sun is going to the south. When it goes like this, it seems like the sun is going to the north.

In this movement, we perceive that the sun is moving through the horizon. But **the planet needs three days to go back, to move into the other position.** Those three days, it is like the sun stays in the same spot in the horizon. That's why we call it the solstice.

From the point of view of the northern hemisphere, the 21st of December, the sun is in the south because the earth is pointing to the south. The 21st of December is **the longest night for the northern hemisphere**—the moment when the sun is pointing to the south.

### The Three Days and the Resurrection

When the earth starts to move back, it stays like this for three days—the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of December. The earth will be still until it comes back again. The day it starts to move again towards the south, so the sun seems to move towards the north, is **the 25th of December.**

**Today, for the northern hemisphere, begins the moment in which the sun is coming back.** That's why we call it **the resurrection of the sun.**

For the southern hemisphere, it is the opposite. The solstice of winter is June 21st. In the southern hemisphere, we are celebrating this day, the 25th of December, because all the countries in the southern hemisphere have been colonies from countries in the northern hemisphere. We took the tradition.

For us in the south, we should celebrate this in June—June 21st or 25th of June—not in December. For the southern hemisphere, the 25th of December represents the moment when the sun starts to go away, to begin the autumn and move toward death. It is the opposite of celebrating the birth, the resurrection.

### Ancient Celebrations of the Sun

In the northern hemisphere, all the cultures that lived in tribes—the cultures of Europe, the native cultures of Asia, northern Asia, and North America—they celebrate the 25th of December as a moment of resurrection because of the sun.

**If God is the sun, if the sun is thought in the skies, then whoever comes to rule the world from the sun would be representing the king or queen of God on earth.** In order to be accepted as a son of God, what they have to do is be reborn, to have the resurrection and rebirth on the 25th of December.

That's why so many gods and important people from the past were chosen to be born—not chosen to be born, but chosen to be reborn in their lives as a spiritual being—the 25th of December.

### The Symbols of Transformation

All these people from the past were related to this movement of the sun. Their goal was to move this wheel of the four equinoxes and solstices in order to change, to transform, the reality. Their goal was to allow the world to be transformed every year so we are not stuck in one only season. **What they represented is transformation.**

That's why the symbol of the cross, the symbol of the circle, the symbol of the swastika—these were all symbols that represented the seasons and were connected to those masters and gods on earth.

### What We Celebrate Today

**What do we celebrate the 25th of December? We celebrate that the sun is coming back to the northern hemisphere.**

### The Nordic Traditions and Santa Claus

As a detail of this story: when the Christian traditions came to Europe from the Middle East, they started to mix with the traditions of the north—the Celtic traditions, the Celtic people, the Vikings, the Saxon people. All these traditions were from the Vikings.

The Vikings had as their main god **Odin.** Odin was this god from the north, from the ice in Lowland, and he accomplished going into the tree of life that they call **Yggdrasil.** From Yggdrasil, he took the runes—the symbols of knowledge, like in the Christian tradition.

He took this information to give it as a gift for new life, the 25th of December, to give it as a gift for humans. In the tradition, this big guy with the long beard, coming from the north, from the ice, from the North Pole, would come to bring this information under the tree. **That's the gift of the holy tree.**

When Christianity and the Nordic traditions mixed with each other, they created this tradition of celebrating Christmas under the tree with this fat guy that comes from the north and gives gifts below a tree. That's kind of why people believe in Santa Claus.

In the Nordic traditions, if you go to Russia or Nordic countries, you will see that **Santa Claus is blue.** He was like this. Yes, there was a campaign of Coca-Cola in the 20s or 30s that changed it into red, just for marketing. And we bought it. That's why Santa is red.

But all the traditions for today are related with the sun starting to come back again to the north. So if you were thinking about not celebrating Christmas anymore, maybe you can celebrate the solstice. By celebrating the solstice, you're celebrating all the traditions from the north where this came from.

### Separating Jesus and the Christ

Now let's separate the concept of Jesus and the Christ.

**Jesus was not born this day, 25th of December.** Jesus—I don't know when he was born. Maybe April, I don't know. I have no idea about that. But something is for sure: **he became Christ on December 25th.**

Jesus is like some other person, like many others that came to do something for the earth. But the 25th of December is the day that represents the Christ. They have to be reborn in the Christ energy, the 25th of December, because this day represents that **the sun is bringing down the information of the new king or ruler of the world.** That's what the tradition used to say, because the sun is coming back. The king of the sun is coming back.

That's why they take this idea of becoming Christ the 25th of December. **So it doesn't matter when Jesus was born. What is really important is what he did when he became Christ.** It's not about when he was born, unless you are a scholar and a curious person. But it doesn't really matter. It's not the point.

The point is when he, as many others, took that information to become Christ.

### Europe: The Heart of the Planet

All these traditions of today came from Europe. And why Europe? **Because Europe is the heart of the planet.**

Europe is basically beating the energy. That's why, along history, Europe is the one that absorbs the information and energy from the outside and pushes it into the outside again. It's beating.

That's why the information from Europe is the one that created all the information of our cultures today around the globalization. As we did yesterday, let's take away the idea of the countries of Europe and let's think just of the territory, the continent of Europe.

### The Legacy of Europe

What we have today—this globalization, the languages that we speak, the connection that we have today, the technologies that we accomplished, the philosophies, the republics, all the ideas that we have today as globalization—basically create what we are now. **All are made in Europe.** All are made basically in the concepts of the European way of thinking.

### The World's Pain with the Heart

The whole world has kind of this resentment with the heart of the world, the heart. It's very difficult. That's why the world is like it is—because we have pain with the heart. Because the heart, instead of just loving, the heart wanted to basically conquer.

Now think in a different way. **If we are the world and Europe is the heart of the world, our body is the world. Our heart is a fractal of Europe.**

If we look into Europe and the heart of Europe and we see the history of Europe, everything that happened, now try to think: **How do you love in your life? How is your relationship with love?**

### Examining Our Own Hearts

Sometimes it's easier to judge continents or countries when we are not paying attention to how I myself love and use the heart. **Why is Europe not in the axis and not able to love unconditionally in history? Basically because we humans cannot love unconditionally. We don't know how to do it.**

Now think about your relationships with your loved ones, your loving ones—with your family, with your partners, with your friends, with all the people that you know. How do you relate with them? Are you jealous? Do you want to control their lives? Do you want—are you waiting for something from them? Are you expecting something from the other ones?

**Just think about the way in which you love.**

### Colonialism as a Reflection of Conditional Love

This link, this dependence with others—we need the other. I need to be loved. I am conditioned by the love of the other ones. In the planet, we call that **colonialism.**

When I am saying to the other ones, like to the countries, "You are an imperialist. This is imperialism." Imperialism is to put your power over the others. When you are saying "This is imperialism," it comes from the word "impede"—it means to put your power on others.

**When you are trying to put your idea upon others, it's imperialism.**

### The Great Scale and the Tiny Scale

This is why we have to understand that all the things that we see that happen in a great scale is because they happen in a tiny scale. **The reason why this body, this physical body, exists is because a tiny proton, electron, and neutron go together.**

Now think in a whole world: how many atoms and molecules exist? There is no world without these families. When we speak about the countries, we are just speaking about the projections of this region, this continent, which is just the result of these tiny particles that coexist.

### Healing the Heart with Love

**Europe is the heart of the planet, but not because it is the heart is something beautiful. It's because the heart beats. And that's what Europe does.**

If this heart is willing to control the others, it's because this heart has never learned how to love. **How can you teach a heart that is trying to control how to love again, how to be in balance? The only way to do that is by love, not by judging.**

### Remembering and Recording

The way in which we connect again is by **remembering.** Remembering means to put all the members together again, all the different parts.

But it comes from another word, which is: all information is **recorded.** Recorded means "come back to the heart." **All the records of our history, we can only heal all of them if we come back to the heart.** That's "record" in Latin, which is "come back to the heart."

### The Journey to the Vatican

That's why every person in the world is connected somehow with the history of Europe. **The only way we can come back to the original pulse to create a new one is if we come back to the heart with love.**

This is why, for example, in 2014, we did this trip to the Vatican, because from the Vatican, the information of the religion spread to the whole world. So from the whole world, we brought that information to the Vatican again with love, so we can start to heal the history.

### Not Attacking Our Enemies

**We are not earning anything by hating those we can see as our enemies.** The reason why we should not attack our enemies, as we were taught to do, and we have to bring love to the origin of those spots, is because **everyone in this world is a part of the same body.**

If we attack each other, what we are just doing is cells killing themselves. That's like, for example, a topological disease like AIDS or cancer—different cells eating each other. That's the disease. And the body dies anyway.

**It doesn't matter who won because they were right, because the body dies anyway.**

### Coming Back to the Heart

This is why to come back to the heart is to bring all the history that we inherited from Europe and bring it back to Europe with love, so we can create a new heartbeat.

**From now on, feel Europe in your heart.**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Reflect on how you love. Examine your relationships with family, partners, and friends. Are you jealous? Do you try to control others? Do you expect something from them? Notice where you are conditional in your love, and practice bringing unconditional love to those relationships.

### Applying This Teaching

Recognize that Europe's history of imperialism and colonialism is a reflection of humanity's struggle with unconditional love. Instead of judging Europe or any nation, bring love and healing to the heart—both the heart of the world and your own heart. Practice "recording"—coming back to the heart—by forgiving history and choosing love over judgment.

## Q&A

### Q: Is December 25th really the birth of Jesus?

No. December 25th is not the literal birth of Jesus. It is related to the winter solstice, the moment when the sun begins to return to the northern hemisphere. Jesus was likely born at another time, but he became Christ on December 25th, symbolically taking on the energy of the resurrection of the sun.

### Q: What is the crucifixion of time?

The crucifixion of time is the cross formed by the equinoxes and solstices—the four positions of the sun along the year. It represents the four seasons and the transformation of reality through these cycles.

### Q: Why does the sun appear to "stay" during the solstice?

The earth needs three days to move into the other position. During those three days (December 22nd, 23rd, 24th), the sun appears to stay in the same spot in the horizon. On the 25th, it begins to move again, symbolizing resurrection.

### Q: What is the connection between Santa Claus and Odin?

Santa Claus comes from the Nordic god Odin, who came from the north, from the ice, to bring the gift of knowledge (the runes) under the tree of life (Yggdrasil). When Christianity mixed with Nordic traditions, this became the tradition of a fat man from the North Pole bringing gifts under a tree. Originally, Santa Claus was blue, not red.

### Q: Why is Europe the heart of the planet?

Europe is the heart of the planet because it beats—it absorbs energy and information from the outside and pushes it out again. Europe has created the languages, philosophies, technologies, and ideas that form the basis of globalization today.

### Q: How is my heart a fractal of Europe?

If Europe is the heart of the world, and you are part of the world, then your heart is a fractal of Europe. The way you love—conditionally or unconditionally—reflects the way Europe has loved throughout history. We are conditional in our love—jealous, controlling, expecting something from others. This is reflected in colonialism and imperialism.

### Q: How can we heal the heart of the world?

By coming back to the heart with love, not judgment. Bring all the history we inherited from Europe back to Europe with love. This is "recording"—coming back to the heart. Heal your own heart by practicing unconditional love, and you heal the heart of the world. By healing your own heart, you contribute to healing the heart of the planet.
