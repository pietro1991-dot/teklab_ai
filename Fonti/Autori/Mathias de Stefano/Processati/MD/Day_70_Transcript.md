## Overview

Today we arrive at the tenth and final pair of the Mind Week in Libra: **Everything and Nothing.** We're working with the **torus**—the full energy field that surrounds and encompasses the entire body, holding all the previous chakras and teachings in one unified field.

This is the culmination, the completion, the integration of all ten balanced pairs we've explored. And fittingly, we end with the most encompassing pair of all: **Everything and Nothing.**

We usually think of these as the ultimate opposites—Everything (all that exists) and Nothing (the void, the absence). But this final teaching reveals what all the Libra teachings have been showing us:

**Everything and Nothing are not opposites—they are completely complementary. They are one process, one reality.**

Here is the profound truth we'll explore:

**Nothing is not "the absence of everything." Nothing is the WOMB from which everything is born.**

The word "nothing" comes from the Latin *nata*, which means **"to be born, to give birth."** Nothing originally meant "that which is in the process of being born—that which hasn't manifested yet."

Over time, it became associated with void, with emptiness. But the deeper truth remains: **Nothing is the womb, the gestation, the creative potential before manifestation.**

**The universe is a being that has been in the process of gestation in the womb we call void.**

**Everything—all of manifest reality—is the child born from Nothing.**

**We are the sons and daughters of Nothing.**

This completes the circle:
- **Everything** = Unity, Belonging, Connection, Manifest Reality
- **Nothing** = Void, Freedom, Potential, Creative Source

And they are not separate. **You are both.**

You are a piece of the Everything puzzle, finding your place, connecting, belonging.  
You are also the Nothing—the void, the freedom, the creative potential that cannot be contained.

The journey of consciousness is learning to dance between them:
- Finding your place in the Everything (unity)
- Setting yourself free into the Nothing (liberation)
- Recognizing both as one eternal creative process

**I Am the Destiny of Eternity.**

Not trapped in manifestation. Not lost in void. But the **eternal creative process** itself—forever born from Nothing into Everything, forever dissolving from Everything back into Nothing.

This is the completion of the Mind Week. Tomorrow we begin the Body Week.

## Core Teaching

### A Note from Matías

Before we begin, I want to clarify something:

The conversations between "I" and "I Am" in my writings are **not me channeling a superior being.** This is not Matías receiving lessons from a higher entity.

**This is myself in different aspects, different levels of consciousness.**

It's not someone I'm channeling—it's myself.

Many of the issues I discuss may seem strange or overly philosophical because I had these conversations with myself members ago, often in a tree or on a mountain, by myself. Now I'm sharing them with you.

Sometimes you ask for examples, and I don't have human examples because **some topics come from other dimensions or from my inner self, and I don't have any comparison with human life.**

So sometimes my issues are very philosophical in the conversation.

And yes, sometimes the "I Am" voice seems like a tyranny, disagreeing with the "I" voice—but **it's sincere.** It's my own inner dialogue.

Each one of you has your own way to receive information from the higher self. This is mine.

### The Final Pair: Everything and Nothing

Today we close the cycle of the Mind Week. The torus is very big—it's holding everything. **So the topic is also very big: Nothing and Everything.**

We talk about Everything and Nothing **as if they are a duality, as if they are different things.**

But in reality, **Everything and Nothing are not two different things—they are completely complementary.**

### We Are Part of the Everything

**To begin:** We are beings, and this means **we are part of the Everything.**

We are a tiny part of the Everything.

**For us, Everything means... everything.**

So being tiny parts of reality, **what we try to do through all our life is put all these different parts together to make meaning out of them** so we can understand the whole, the totality of the universe.

### Everything Is Made of Unity

Being part of the Everything, what we understand is that **each tiny little part is a unity in itself.**

What we're trying to do is **find the unity of all those aspects.**

**For us, in this side of the universe that we call Everything, what we are looking for as the final goal is Unity.**

As we are all united, we can understand the whole.

### The Process: Separate, Then Reunite

The first thing we do in our life is **separate the whole into different pieces.**

We divide all these different pieces so we can analyze each one by itself.

The next step is to **find these pieces and put them together**—see the joins of each one so we can understand how they fit each other.

**Like a big puzzle.**

### Joints vs. Unity

The concept of putting all things together is the process of **joining.**

Picture this: The process of joining **doesn't matter if they match or not.** You're trying to put all things together, it doesn't matter if they're different.

**This is the beginning of what we call the "-isms"**—capitalism, communism, socialism. All the -isms are trying to join different aspects that were separated.

It's like taking all the different parts of the puzzle but pushing them all to one spot by force—**they're all together, but they're not connected.**

You say, "Yes, all of this must be together," but they don't fit yet.

### True Unity: Connection

The next step is to **understand the purpose and the place and the qualities that each one of the pieces has.**

**What is the place this piece has to play in this puzzle?**

**This is what we call Unity**—when you start to place the pieces where they belong.

You do that by the thing called **connection.**

**Allowing the pieces to understand:**
- The place where they belong
- The potentialities that each one has

By nature, they start to connect with others. They start to fit. They start to unite through connection.

**By this natural process, they become united through connection.**

### Unity Doesn't Require Force

In order to do this, **you don't need to gather anyone.**

It's a natural process that happens.

Of course, some pieces are the first ones you place, and those say "from here you can begin, you can start."

But **each one of these pieces is as important as the other** because all of them create the image of the whole.

### The Need to Belong

Having this image, we can picture **the need of humans to belong to something.**

This is when we understand the need of humans to belong to:
- A family
- A group
- A society
- A culture
- A religion
- A species
- A race

**The reason we need to belong is because when I belong, I can recognize myself.**

I can understand: **"This is my part in the group."**

I can recognize the purpose I have there. Otherwise, I wouldn't see it.

When I put myself in the place where I belong, **my whole body starts to feel relaxed** because now I know I am part of a whole.

### Feeling Trapped in the Everything

There will come someday when, even if you've been relaxed because now you belong...

**You will start to feel trapped.**

Because in this puzzle, all the other pieces around you are holding so tight that you can't move.

**It's in that moment when I feel so trapped that I feel the need to go beyond and to set myself free from this network.**

### Losing the Everything, Finding the Nothing

But what happens after I set myself free from that network?

**I lose the sense of Everything.**

**I lose Everything.**

And there is when I find myself in front of the concept of **Nothing.**

### The Concept of Nothing

The concept we usually have is:
- I am alone
- There is nothing that has any meaning
- The entire void

**It's in that moment when I recognize:**

The Everything for me was:
- Belonging
- Protection
- Stability

Suddenly, when I step outside, when I detach from the whole and see it from above, I say:

**"What is the purpose of this? What is the meaning? There is nothing beyond. I die and what? Shadow? Anything? Void?"**

### Facing the Absolute Void

All of us someday have gone through, or will go through, **the process of facing the absolute void** where there is Nothing.

You perceive the biggest loneliness you may ever experience.

**There is Nothing.**

### I Am the Nothing

There will come this moment when you recognize:

**"Oh, I am the Nothing."**

### The Etymology of Nothing

This is the moment when we go to the origin of the word "nothing."

**Nothing comes from the word *nata*** (Latin), which is the participle of **"to be born."**

*Nata* means **"to give birth."**

With time, the concept of "being born" and *nata* was used to express the idea of **"something that is just being gestated. It hasn't been born yet."**

In sentences like "This hasn't been born yet," in Latin you would say **"This was not *nata*."**

So it turned into the negative concept: **"This is void because what is being gestated hasn't arrived yet."**

### Nothing = The Womb

This is why the concept of Nothing came from **the idea of being born.**

This brings us to the understanding:

**The universe is a being that has been in the process of gestation in the womb that we call void.**

**This is why vacuum, the void, is what we could call the WOMB of the universe**—where you gestate, where you give birth to reality.

**The Nothing can give birth to reality.**

### Children of Nothing

**From there are born the sons and daughters of Nothing that we call the Everything.**

**We are the children of Nothing.**

### Transforming Our Understanding

This is one of the great concepts we have to transform:

**What is Everything and what is Nothing.**

In our human life, Everything will take us to give meaning to the whole.

**But at the end of the path, we are going to find the Nothing.**

### Coming Back to the Origin

This is why when we talk about **coming back to the origin**, where we are going to go is **back to the womb.**

And the womb is the void.

**The moment before we were born.**

**The Nothing.**

### Masters Describe the Void

This is why when you read or hear enlightened ones, masters, guides, or whoever has experienced the closest connection with the Divine, with the very origin, with the moment of creation...

**All of them will describe the void. Nothing.**

**Because it's the closest thing we could have to explain what we are.**

### The Puzzle and the Void

Remember the example:

The Everything is basically this puzzle where you are just a piece, stuck in that piece between many other pieces.

This is why we have this feeling that **in the Everything, we feel trapped in this network.**

**And in the Nothing, we feel void.**

### Why Create Everything from Nothing?

**So we could ask ourselves:**

If we feel free in the Nothing, **why have we created the Everything? Why have we created all this matter?**

Try to remember what we spoke about yesterday: **What for? What is the closest answer to "why"?**

Yes, the answer, the easiest answer, is: **For nothing. No sense. For nothing.**

Now: **Why? Why for nothing? Why without sense, without meaning? Why create Everything just for Nothing?**

### The Only Way to Be Free

**The answer is very easy:**

**It's the only way in which you can be free in the process of creation.**

Imagine you are the best artist, and suddenly someone from behind tells you:

**"Hey, you are the greatest artist ever. But you have a purpose in your life, and this is your purpose. You have to do this and this to accomplish your purpose."**

**Certainly, you are not an artist anymore. Now you are a missionary, and you are stuck in order to accomplish your mission and your purpose in life.**

### Creation Without Purpose Is Freedom

**The reason why the Nothing creates the Everything without purpose, without meaning, is to set the Everything free to create.**

Everything that exists in life, everything that exists in reality, exists as a tool:
- Brushes
- Pencils
- Colors

**This is basically what we do in our lives: learn how to use brushes, how to use pencils, how to use colors to make our own creation.**

**What I have to understand for myself is:**
- What are the colors and pencils I have within?
- How do I use them to create?

### Who Makes the Decisions?

Now we have to ask ourselves this question:

**If each one of us is a tiny little cell, one of the billions that creates the body of the universe—who makes the decisions?**

**The cells. Each one of the cells ARE the mind of the universe.**

### We Are the Mind of the Universe

Picture that our whole life, we have been **giving the power to "the mind of the universe" as if we are not part of that mind.**

**In order for the cosmos to exist, for a body to exist, we need a cell.**

And the potential within the cell is called **DNA.**

**Without the tools of the DNA, a cell cannot create a body.**

### Each Cell Creates the Universe

This is why **it's not the great universe that creates the idea and the purpose of everything.**

**It's each tiny cell that, in its process of evolution, creates the idea of what the universe is.**

**From our inner void, from our Nothing, is from where we can create a new universe.**

### You Don't Literally Create a Universe

Don't think—because a lot of people think this—that when you are able to create your own universe, it's literally that you can create your own universe.

**It's not like that.**

**It's when you recognize that you can change your perception of the universe.**

**The universe starts to be shaped in that same perception.**

### This Takes Time to Understand

Of course, this is not something you have to acknowledge now.

**This is something that maybe will take your whole life, or maybe a lot of lives, to integrate.**

This is something that will take a lot of time to understand **because this is not something you will understand from the mind.**

**This is something you have to experience, to live.**

What I am doing here is trying to explain a tiny little part of how it works.

**So when you experience it, you don't get afraid, and you can relate it and understand what is happening.**

I say "afraid" because sometimes it's gigantic—like, "Oh my God, there's too much" when you feel it.

**If this is useful, good. If it's not useful, it doesn't matter.**

### Completing the Mind Week

This completes the Mind Week of Libra.

We have explored ten pairs of balanced opposites, each revealing the same truth in different forms:

**What seems opposite is actually complementary. What seems divided is actually unified. What seems dual is actually one process.**

Everything and Nothing are the final, all-encompassing expression of this truth.

**I Am the Destiny of Eternity.**

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch your entire body—all of it. Yawn. Cross your limbs. Massage yourself.

Let the weight of your body fall down. Release all tension.

Focus on your breathing. Feel the air coming inside your whole body.

### Becoming Wind

Focus only on your breathing and how your entire body becomes wind.

Feel the air outside your body. Perceive the wind around you connecting with the wind within yourself.

### The Mountain and the Vortex

Perceive yourself sitting at the edge of a mountain, contemplating a beautiful scene.

From the valley below comes the wind that crosses through your body.

**Feel so light, like a feather.**

Perceive the warm wind from inside you and the cold wind from outside creating **a vortex, a twister, around your entire body.**

### The Eye of the Hurricane

Take a deep breath and put your hands facing up to the sun.

**Breathe the calm in the center of this hurricane.**

Perceive the sun, the light of the sun, coming toward the eye of the hurricane, going through:

Crown → Third Eye → Throat → Heart → Solar Plexus → Sacral → Root → Knees → Ankles

Coming out through your feet.

### The Rainbow Torus

Feel the light coming out from your body through the feet and **going up in a spiral, spinning around like the hurricane around your whole body**, reaching the crown.

**Feel surrounded by a twister of a rainbow.**

From every part of your body, the light starts to go to the palms of your hands.

**Feel this rainbow light filling up your hands, receiving the weight of it—like the gold at the edge of a rainbow.**

### Integration: Everything in One Hand, Nothing in the Other

**In one hand, you hold EVERYTHING—the concept of Unity that completes yourself.**

**In the other hand, you hold NOTHING—the void.**

### Understanding Both

Recognize:

**I created Everything. I created Everything from Nothing.**

**Therefore, it is from Nothing from where I can create a new whole, a new Everything.**

**Both of them live in me.**

### The Final Unification

Bring both hands to your heart.

Make the sound to spread this consciousness in every direction:

**SSñú... SSñú... SSñú... SSñú...**

Feel the vibration unifying:

**I am the Everything and the Nothing. Both of them are one within me.**

### Integration of Ten Days - The Complete Mind Week

Now, for the final time in this week, integrate all ten pairs from crown to torus:

**Crown - Eternal/Finite:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Third Eye - Light/Darkness:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Throat - Truth/Lies:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Heart - Love/Hate:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Solar Plexus - Personality/Essence:** Light splits to hands, unite at solar plexus with **SSñú...**

**Sacral - Creation/Destruction:** Light splits to hands, unite at sacral with **SSñú...**

**Root - Good/Bad:** Light splits to hands, unite at root with **SSñú...**

**Knees - Matrix/Patterns:** Light splits to hands, unite at knees with **SSñú...**

**Ankles - Meaning/Meaninglessness:** Light splits to hands, unite at ankles with **SSñú...**

**Torus - Everything/Nothing:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart, expand to full field with **SSñú...**

### Closing the Mind Week

Place both hands on your heart, feeling the rainbow vortex around your entire body.

Say with full awareness:

**"I Am the Destiny of Eternity."**

**"I Am the Destiny of Eternity."**

**"I Am the Destiny of Eternity."**

I am not trapped in the Everything.  
I am not lost in the Nothing.  
**I am the eternal creative process—forever born from Nothing into Everything, forever dissolving from Everything back into Nothing.**

Take a deep breath.

Begin to spread this awareness through all your body by caressing it, stretching, yawning.

Come back here and now, softly opening your eyes.

**The Mind Week is complete.**

Tomorrow we begin the Body Week.

## Integration

### Final Integration: The Ten Balanced Pairs of Mind Week

**You have now completed the Mind Week of Libra.** Here are the ten pairs you've integrated:

1. **Eternal/Finite** - The pendulum's eternal swing through finite moments
2. **Light/Darkness** - Presence and absence creating form
3. **Truth/Lies** - Verified reality and creative imagination
4. **Love/Hate** - Connection and protective boundary
5. **Personality/Essence** - Mask and authentic actor
6. **Creation/Destruction** - Gathering and dispersing forms
7. **Good/Bad** - Human conventions for safety and harmony
8. **Matrix/Patterns** - Network and tools creating reality
9. **Meaning/Meaninglessness** - Mind's map and void's creative potential
10. **Everything/Nothing** - Manifest wholeness and generative womb

### The Pattern Revealed

Look at the pattern across all ten pairs:

**Every pair shows the same truth:**
- What seems opposite is complementary
- What seems divided is unified
- What seems dual is one process
- What seems contradictory is creative

**The Mind Week has trained you to see beyond dualistic thinking** and recognize the unified creative process behind all apparent opposites.

### Daily Practice Moving Forward

**Continue the ten-pair integration daily:**

Do the full practice (10-15 minutes):
1. Sit comfortably, become wind
2. Create the rainbow vortex around your body
3. For each of the ten pairs:
   - Light from corresponding chakra to both hands
   - Hold the pair (one in each hand)
   - Unite at the chakra with SSñú sound
4. Final integration at heart/torus
5. "I Am the Destiny of Eternity"

**This embeds the teachings into your nervous system,** transforming intellectual understanding into embodied wisdom.

### Recognizing the Everything-Nothing Dance

This week, practice recognizing when you're in:

**The Everything phase:**
- Seeking belonging
- Finding your place
- Connecting with others
- Building unity
- Creating structure

**The Nothing phase:**
- Feeling trapped
- Needing freedom
- Facing the void
- Dissolving structures
- Touching pure potential

**Neither is better. Both are necessary.**

The dance between them is the creative process itself.

### When You Feel Trapped in Everything

**If you're feeling trapped in belonging, structure, the puzzle:**

1. **Honor what it gave you:** "This belonging helped me find myself"
2. **Feel the limitation:** "Now I need freedom to grow"
3. **Set yourself free:** "I step into the void consciously"
4. **Trust the Nothing:** "The void is the womb, not death"

### When You Feel Lost in Nothing

**If you're feeling lost in void, meaninglessness, isolation:**

1. **Honor the freedom:** "This void gave me space to discover"
2. **Feel the loneliness:** "Now I need connection to express"
3. **Seek your place:** "Where do I belong in the Everything?"
4. **Trust the Everything:** "Unity is not trap, it's home"

### Children of Nothing Creating Everything

**Practice the ultimate recognition:**

**You are a child of Nothing.**

You were born from the void, the womb, the creative potential.

**You are creating Everything.**

Every perception, every meaning, every reality you experience—you're creating it.

**This is not metaphor. This is how consciousness works.**

From your inner void (Nothing), you create your experience of universe (Everything).

**You are both the womb and the child.**  
**You are both the creator and the created.**  
**You are both the artist and the art.**

### The Purpose of Purposelessness

**Remember the teaching:**

The Nothing creates the Everything **without purpose, without meaning**—not as punishment or meaninglessness, but **as freedom.**

**If you had a fixed cosmic purpose, you'd be a missionary, not an artist.**

The lack of inherent purpose **is what sets you free to create any purpose.**

This is liberation, not nihilism.

### Weekly Reflection: Completing Mind Week

Take time to reflect on the full journey:

**What have I learned about:**
- How opposites are actually complementary?
- How my mind creates dualistic thinking?
- How unity underlies apparent division?
- How I can transcend either/or into both/and?

**How have I changed through:**
- Ten days of balancing practices?
- Integrating opposite energies?
- Recognizing my role as creator?
- Touching the void and the wholeness?

**What am I taking forward:**
- Into the Body Week starting tomorrow?
- Into my daily spiritual practice?
- Into my understanding of reality?
- Into my creative power?

### Preparing for Body Week

**Tomorrow begins a new week:** The Body Week of Libra.

**Mind Week focused on:** How consciousness perceives, creates meaning, and understands reality.

**Body Week will focus on:** How consciousness manifests, expresses, and creates in matter.

**Rest deeply tonight.** The Mind Week was intense, philosophical, consciousness-expanding.

**The Body Week will be different**—more grounded, practical, physical.

You've completed the mental integration. Now comes the physical embodiment.

## Q&A

### Q: How can Nothing be the womb if it's void, empty, absence?

**Because "nothing" doesn't mean "absence"—it means "not yet born."** The womb is "empty" of the child before birth, but it's full of creative potential, gestation, life forming. The void is not empty—it's **pregnant with possibility.** Every manifest thing emerges from this generative emptiness. Think of it as pure potential before actualization, not absence.

### Q: If I'm a child of Nothing, does that mean I come from emptiness and will return to emptiness with no purpose?

**You come from creative potential and return to creative potential—and the "in between" is also creative potential expressed.** You're not moving from empty to empty with meaningless stuff in the middle. You're the eternal creative process: potential (Nothing) → expression (Everything) → potential (Nothing) → new expression (Everything) → forever. **You ARE the creative process, not a temporary interruption of emptiness.**

### Q: How do I balance the need to belong (Everything) with the need for freedom (Nothing) without constantly swinging between extremes?

**Recognize both as necessary phases of one process, not as enemies.** You don't have to choose. Sometimes you need belonging—embrace it fully while it serves. Sometimes you need freedom—embrace it fully when it calls. The suffering comes from resisting whichever phase you're in. **Flow with the dance.** Belong when it's time to belong. Be free when it's time to be free. Both are home.

### Q: What's the practical application of knowing "I'm creating Everything from my inner Nothing"?

**It means you have creative power over your reality—not through magical manifestation, but through conscious perception and meaning-creation.** You can't control external events, but you shape how you perceive them, what meaning you give them, what reality you create from them. **Your inner void is your creative source.** When you touch it, you can birth new perspectives, new meanings, new responses—new Everythings from your Nothing.

### Q: The ten days feel overwhelming. How do I integrate all of this?

**Don't integrate intellectually—integrate energetically.** Do the daily practice (10-15 minutes) moving through all ten pairs with the SSñú sound. Your nervous system will integrate what your mind can't process. **The intellectual understanding deepens naturally through embodied practice.** Trust the process. Let your body remember what your mind can't hold.

### Q: If there's no purpose and we're just creating freely, what's the point of spiritual practice?

**Spiritual practice is how you consciously participate in the creative process instead of unconsciously repeating patterns.** It's the difference between being an artist (conscious creator) and being a photocopier (unconscious repeater). **Practice awakens you to your creative power.** Then you create purposelessly—not meaninglessly, but freely, without being a missionary stuck in fulfilling some cosmic purpose. You create because you ARE creation.

### Q: How does this Everything-Nothing teaching relate to all the previous nine pairs?

**It encompasses them all:** Eternal/Finite (Nothing is eternal, Everything is finite expressions), Light/Darkness (Everything is light, Nothing is darkness/potential), Truth/Lies (Everything is constructed truth, Nothing is creative potential for new truths), Love/Hate (Everything is connection, Nothing is individuated freedom), Personality/Essence (Everything is expressed personalities, Nothing is pure essence), Creation/Destruction (Everything is created forms, Nothing is the source before and after form), Good/Bad (Everything is moral structures, Nothing has no morality), Matrix/Patterns (Everything is the constructed matrix, Nothing is the field beyond patterns), Meaning/Meaninglessness (Everything is created meanings, Nothing is the source before meaning). **Everything-Nothing contains all previous pairs.**

### Q: After Mind Week ends, do I stop practicing these ten pairs?

**No—continue daily practice of all ten pairs.** They're foundational. Mind Week established them. Now they become your permanent practice, integrated with whatever Body Week adds. **Think of it as layers:** Mind Week is the foundation. Body Week adds the next layer. Each week builds on previous weeks while maintaining daily integration of all teachings.

## Closing Reflection

**We have completed the Mind Week of Libra.**

Ten days. Ten balanced pairs. Ten teachings that all reveal the same ultimate truth:

**What seems opposite is actually complementary. What seems divided is actually unified. What seems dual is actually one creative process.**

Today's final pair—Everything and Nothing—encompasses all the others:

**Nothing is not the absence of Everything. Nothing is the WOMB that gives birth to Everything.**

You are a child of Nothing, creating Everything, forever.

**You are not trapped in manifest reality (Everything) with no escape.**  
**You are not lost in void (Nothing) with no purpose.**  

**You are the eternal creative process**—forever emerging from the womb (Nothing) into expression (Everything), forever dissolving from expression (Everything) back into the womb (Nothing), forever creating anew.

This is not suffering. This is not meaningless cycling. **This is the dance of consciousness—the eternal creative play.**

And you are not a victim of this dance. **You ARE the dance.**

**The Nothing creates the Everything without purpose**—not because nothing matters, but **to set creation free.**

You are the artist, not the missionary.  
You are the creative force, not the slave to cosmic purpose.  
You are the child of Nothing, creating Everything, eternally free.

**I Am the Destiny of Eternity.**

Not bound by time. Not trapped in manifestation. Not lost in void.

**I am the eternal process itself**—the Nothing giving birth to Everything, the Everything dissolving into Nothing, the creative dance that never ends.

**Mind Week is complete.**

**Tomorrow, Body Week begins.**

**The journey continues.**

Rest in the Everything.  
Rest in the Nothing.  
**Rest in knowing you are both.**

See you tomorrow.
