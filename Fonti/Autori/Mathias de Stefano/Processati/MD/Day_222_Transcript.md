## Introduction

I have everyone been running good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

Today we had arrived to our day 222. 222 steps in this path of the I am. It 's very symbolic that today is 222. Then this is our 222 gathering because all we are doing is because of a new humanity.

Trying to put our intention on creating something new , something that we expect to leave this to have 2022 and to experience this day 222 with a gathering in one year. All of this is just an expectation and an idea. It 's amazing that they are two of our elements. It 's the topic of utopia.

So let 's speak today about the topic of utopia. To try to understand what this concept means in our vision of the things from the perspective of our inner pieces is the vision of this aspect of ourselves.

So first of all let 's understand what utopia means.

So we can understand the next. Utopia comes from the Greek stops. Meaning no and tops meaning place.

So this means no place there is no place. And the infinity well not infinity the suffix here or yeah utopia means the concept of the concept of a place that is not there. In Greek language.

So to understand topic we will have to go a few months ago when we were in such a place we were speaking about how the purpose was created in front of us in our path.

So let 's go way beyond before in the past. To the very beginning of this humanity as we know it.

So let 's go to the very beginning of the humanity. How we started. That we said that the first humans they were in the south of Africa in the continent. And they were living in the forest and local.

And suddenly climate change. There was a big bomb and everyone had to to stronger to look for a different place where they could have food mainly.

So they went into the horizon and they started to look for this food. Where can we find it? Trees and animals whatever.

So they started to go towards the horizon. Imagine in how that place would look like with many trees with many animals. A lot of water.

So they kept looking to a never. It was never enough because every time they reached a perfect place they said no but it should have this or that.

So they kept imagining this place that is better and even better than the first one. For the last one they visited.

So they started to create this idea , this path. The stories that the old ones told to the young ones telling this place has the best trees , the best animals , best waters. It has everything you can possibly need , security , happiness , everything is there.

## Q&A

So the stories were so beautiful that no place in the earth would feet that this question. It was like dream.

So that 's why nobody could find it. And they started to call this place the place of no place. And that 's you to be utopia. Along this path when they were trying to reach for this beautiful place , the young two that there is no place in earth.

That could fit in that perfection.

So they just said , well , this place only can exist with the gods in the heavens.

So they started to decide this place in the heavens. And that was the only place where you could go when you die when you go to live with the gods. And that 's why the utopia started to be something attached to the heavens. The cultures and the religions of this idea to design the perfect place where you go after you die.

The ultimate horizon. The ultimate horizon. When you 're in the world , you can find the paradise.

Now utopia.

So they call this the last horizon when you die. They last trip you take and there you find the paradise. They are utopian.

So when they were describing this topic place , we could see that this was like a dream. It was so perfect that it 's like a dream. And you can attach it. You can only think about it.

Dream about it. And this is why this is an ideal place and idyllic place. And idyllic is the origin. Its origin is the idea.

The idea is the shape forms. It 's only real.

So even if this place is just imagination , it was the key for humans to expand for the humans to be what we are. Because without that place , we would n't have moved through all the realities that we have been through.

So for the religious people , for the religious people , the spiritual people , they thought like this place is like an award for everything that you have done in your life or the path of your life. And for the agnostic and at least people , this place , the idea is like the perfect system where you can find perfection. Where all the effort takes its benefit.

So even if it is through the paths , through the body , through the path of society , sociology , the concept of utopia is something that we all need and that we all have used. To improve ourselves , because that 's the idea of perfection that we are looking for. When we look to do something , to make it perfect , to transcend ourselves into perfection , that 's the idea that moves us forward. The utopia is just an idea.

It does n't really exist. It 's not the place. It 's just the image that we have in our mind that we expect to be , like for example , people that is looking for enlightenment , people that is willing to transcend their lives. People that want to to reach the perfect society to reach the world peace.

This is the motto that this people we have in order to go to find it , to keep going. But it 's not real. It does n't exist.

So utopia is like this idea , imaginary idea , that helps us move forward to look for something better , because never is enough. Speaking about utopia , let 's try to make an example of what is utopia. A thousand years ago in the Middle Ages , what we are living today , is a utopia. For everyone , they did n't even have that , but then it was impossible.

Today we have much more people complaining about our reality than people complaining in the Middle Ages during the acquisition. It 's not because of the quantity of population. It was because we only have two options. Or the Christian heaven or the Muslim heaven.

And some others , maybe , around. But we here today , we are living and utopia that has been thought 300 years ago only. 300 years ago , democracy , republics , free decision , free speech , was just an illusion , was just an utopia. A few decades ago , to think about equality in between men and women utopia , a few decades ago , to think about racist equality , even if we should not say racist , also utopia.

And we are still complaining , even if we are living the utopia of people that are still alive. There are people who in this same life , if they live today , and they have seen how their utopia is real. And even so , it 's not enough. There is people alive still that has been , that have seen along their lives.

How their utopia became true. And even though it 's not enough , we are still complaining.

So , we are still complaining because a utopia is an idea that lives only in our mind , that is impossible to manifest. Because it does n't matter what we do here , the things that we imagine in our mind will be never exactly here as we expect. We will have always something to improve. And as much we earn the ability to be free of thinking , not to be pressed by the thoughts of others who are the beliefs of others , and we start to believe in ourselves , each one of us , each individual , will have its own idea.

So , its own utopia.

So , it will never be enough to make everyone happy ever. The idea of utopia is not to arrive to a place. It was made in order to ask for us to move forward. How many of us have been living thinking and asking ourselves , how am I going to leave the change?

I am going to be able to enjoy all this effort that we are doing. And now ask yourself , how many people have died thinking that during the process of that change , but thinking that it was not enough , because it was not like they had it in their minds. When we leave our lives just thinking about reaching our utopia , we are missing the importance , the important thing , that the change is happening right around us , not in front.

So , imagine , for example , this , what we are doing now. We are here speaking about all this. I am sharing all my truth here with you in a Muslim country , being homosexual , and my organization is all ruled by women , how I would have been in jail. This is the utopia that we are living.

I can not expect anymore. The important thing to understand here is that what we are doing of that this knowing that this is perfect , it does n't mean that we should not do anything for the future. We have to do things. We have to work a lot.

We have to do many things to get better to transform , to change many things. We have many things to do. Of course , but it does n't mean the perfection is in front. It does n't mean that it 's in the future where we will see the results.

It 's not there. We have to keep doing things and getting better , but we have to realize that what we are living is our utopia. Then we had accomplished many things. If we are all the time thinking about the perfection of the future , we are not understanding all the accomplish.

Just reminding you of our way we have spoken these days. Nothing exists. Nothing really exists. There is nothing here.

This is just an image , an idea of something , remember , dimension zero. This is all just an idea. If it is so , this means that there is no time and space in the basis of the universe. Which means that everything is in utopia.

Everything. Which means that we are utopian. Why should we put utopia ahead in the future in front? If we can download it here and now.

Remember that the reason why we put utopia in front of us is because in our history of mammals we were looking for that imaginary place in front of the horizon , looking for it. But in the universe there is no horizon , there is no time.

So why to put it ahead? If it is everywhere , the utopia then moves the soul in order to create the body. The utopia is this constant ticking of being something different of transforming ourselves to find out different ways of being. It is an idea like dream that pushes forward.

It is not a place where we have to go. It is not a place of perfection. Utopia is a dream that creates us. This is a good thing for to understand about the attributes of pieces.

The pieces is not looking for that utopia in front. Pieces is trying to leave that utopia here.

Now , by loving everyone and conditional , by living this love , doing everything that they can for the rest. Living it here and now. We can not build utopia and willing to accomplish goals in the future. The way we accomplish our goals is by enjoying them and choosing them here and now , choosing what we leave.

So for example , to seek for enlightenment , when you are looking for enlightenment , like let 's run to get to the seventh dimension to find enlightenment. When you are willing to find enlightenment in that way , you are forgetting something really important that the seventh dimension is not a place you can go. Is the light you can feel within? When you enlighten yourself by acknowledging that you are all that.

So the seventh dimension is the enlightenment , the shining process , where you put together all what you are. What is the goal on running to do that when you are ready to are that? Enlightenment to seek enlightenment in the future is the way in which a mammal understand the utopia.

So for example , I have my own utopia which is the own democracy. The own democracy is the social system that I am imagining in my head which is my own utopia for the future. Because my utopia is not spiritual , it 's not about global peace and so on. That 's too much.

Well , I do n't know. But I 'm not thinking about that utopia. I 'm thinking just willing to build a system that could help to transcend the actual social systems.

So that 's my utopia. But the problem would be if I believe that that utopia is the best one. The problem would be if I say this would be the only system that can help. Actually , my utopia which is own democracy , it does n't have a political or cultural or whatever vision does n't have an ideology specifically.

Because the concept of this utopia is for it to keep being a utopia.

So we can improve.

So we can get better once and again when we just think that this is the perfect system.

So that 's when it does n't work. The basics of an utopia is that we can keep transforming ourselves not that it to be perfect.

So now two things about the utopia that I want for you to have. The first one is that utopia from the point of view of humans is that motivation that we have to move forward to transform ourselves constantly. In the other hand , utopia for the cosmos is everything because nothing really exists. Everything is just a dream from the point of view of the universe.

So everything is an utopia that makes us a dream.

So if we become aware of the dream , we become dreamer. Being able to leave their own utopia. Here comes the idea of the purpose. The purpose , remember to put something ahead.

So a utopia is the purpose that keeps us transforming ourselves. And in the universe , if there is no ahead , so the purpose can be only one thing. One self. Hmm.

Okay. I just realized that when someone starts to wear the glasses doing like this , it 's because you are becoming old already and I am feeling old today.

## Daily Practice Elements

So , I do n't know. The vibration for today is pie. The statement for today is I am the will of purpose. The code for today is to order.

When I am able to manipulate my own energy and have under micro troll all the emotions , the attributes of ordering arrives. This means of placing everything in its place. It intifimed what belongs to me and what does n't. The serving what belongs to the body , to the soul or the spirit.

What to the past , to the present , or to the future. What 's mine and what 's from others. What things are useful and what is useless. Well , we are going to start from the beginning.

Let 's begin with the lines. See the comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. I pay attention to the energy of my body , fill in it , like ways of seeing ways of cold and heat. I try to connect to perceive which emotions are moving around my body as this energy.

## Q&A

How they go for me and I pay attention to the places of my body where this emotion are moving , going through like this way. I am like that the feeling behind my mask when you feel weird is because of my Abi. Darling? !

Recognize that this emotion is the energy that comes from the magnetism , the emerges from the particles that creates the atoms that constitute my body. . . .

I recognize and become aware that all my emotions and energies are nothing else that are false that the merges from the void in between my atoms.

So I take the breath and I expand this energy towards the cosmos. The scene to bridge my body , like a star exploding in the universe. The side breathing. The side feel nothing , expanded in the cosmos.

I recognize myself as a beam outside of time outside of space. I am the uterine of the universe online.

So I become aware that this uterine is nothing from me. It is nothing the perfection of the future. It is right here now. In me and I can create a.

. .

Today. I am the only one able to find the real to be a de-purpose that takes me to the uterine. Take it a breath. A side can imagine this uterine.

I use all these atoms that I expand it of myself. And I imagine creating this uterine , this perfection of myself , expanded the outside around within. The breath. And I also imagine this perfection of this place.
