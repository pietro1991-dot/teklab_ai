- **Chakra Focus:** Third Eye
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Emotional Week
- **Main Topic:** Utopia, Purpose, and the Horizon That Never Arrives

This means placing everything in its place, identifying what belongs to me and what doesn't, discerning what belongs to the body, to the soul, or the spirit, what to the past, to the present, or to the future, what's mine and what's from others, what things are useful and what is useless.

## Overview

Today is Day 222—a symbolic number. This is our 222nd gathering because all we are doing is for a new humanity, putting our intention on creating something new. To experience this day 222 with a gathering in one year—**all of this is just an expectation and an idea**.

And those two elements—expectation and idea—bring us to today's topic: **utopia**.

We are in the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where we feel the dissolution of boundaries and connect to the ideal vision of what could be. The third eye chakra allows us to **see beyond what is** and imagine what could become.

**Utopia** is not a place we arrive at. It is **the dream that moves us forward**, the horizon that keeps us evolving, the idea that prevents us from becoming stagnant.

---

## The Meaning of Utopia

### Etymology

**Utopia** comes from Greek:
- **"U"** (ou) = no, not
- **"Topos"** = place

**Utopia means "no place"—a place that is not there.**

The suffix "-ia" creates the concept of a place, so utopia means **the concept of a place that is not there**.

### The Origin Story

To understand utopia, we must go back to the very beginning of humanity as we know it.

The first humans lived in South Africa, in forests. Suddenly, climate change came. There was a drought, and everyone had to migrate to look for food—trees, animals, water.

They went toward the **horizon** and started to search: "Where can we find it?"

They kept looking, and it was **never enough**. Every time they reached a perfect place, they said, "No, but it should have this or that." So they kept imagining this place that is better, even better than the last one they visited.

### The Stories

They started to create this idea, this vision. The elders told the young ones: "This place has the best trees, the best animals, the best water. It has everything you can possibly need—security, happiness, everything is there."

The stories were so beautiful that **no place on earth could fit that description**. It was like a dream.

That's why nobody could find it. They started to call this place **"the place of no place"**—utopia.

### Moving to the Heavens

Along this path, the young ones realized: there is no place on Earth that could fit that perfection.

So they said, "Well, this place can only exist with the gods in the heavens."

They started to design this place in the heavens. That was the only place you could go when you die, when you go to live with the gods.

That's why **utopia started to be attached to the heavens**—the perfect place where you go after you die.

---

## Utopia as the Last Horizon

### The Ultimate Horizon

The cultures and religions took this idea to design the perfect place where you go after you die—**the last horizon**.

When you're in the world, you can't find paradise, you can't find utopia. They call it the last horizon when you die, the last trip you take, and there you find paradise, utopia.

### Dream and Reality

When describing this utopian place, we see it was like a **dream**. It was so perfect that it's like a dream. You can't touch it. You can only think about it, dream about it.

This is why it is an **ideal place**, an **idyllic place**. "Idyllic" has its origin in "**idea**"—the ideal is the shape, the form. It's only real in the mind.

### The Key to Expansion

Even if this place is just imagination, **it was the key for humans to expand**, for humans to be what we are.

Because without that place, we wouldn't have moved through all the realities we have been through.

---

## Utopia for Religious and Secular People

### For Religious and Spiritual People

For religious and spiritual people, this place is like an **award** for everything you have done in your life, the path of your life.

Enlightenment, heaven, nirvana—all are versions of utopia: the perfect state you reach after all your effort.

### For Agnostic and Atheist People

For agnostic and atheist people, this place (the idea) is like the **perfect system** where you can find perfection, where all effort takes its benefit.

The perfect society, world peace, equality—these are secular utopias.

### The Universal Need

Even if it is through spirit, through body, through society, through sociology, the concept of utopia is **something we all need** and have all used to improve ourselves.

It is **the idea of perfection** that we are looking for.

---

## Utopia Is Just an Idea

### Not a Real Place

Utopia is just an idea. It doesn't really exist. It's not a place.

It's just the **image we have in our mind** that we expect to be.

People looking for enlightenment, people willing to transcend their lives, people wanting to reach world peace—**this is the motivation** that helps us move forward, to keep going.

But **it's not real. It doesn't exist.**

### The Purpose of Utopia

Utopia is like this imaginary idea that helps us **move forward**, to look for something better, because **never is enough**.

A thousand years ago in the Middle Ages, what we are living today **is a utopia**. They didn't even have the concept. It was impossible.

Yet today, we have much more people complaining about our reality than people complaining in the Middle Ages during the Inquisition.

---

## We Are Living Someone's Utopia

### 300 Years Ago

Three hundred years ago, democracy, republics, free decision, free speech—all were just an illusion, just a utopia.

A few decades ago, to think about equality between men and women: utopia.

To think about racial equality: utopia.

**We are still complaining, even if we are living the utopia of people who are still alive.**

### People Who Saw Their Utopia Become Real

There are people alive still who have seen, along their lives, how their utopia became true. And even so, **it's not enough**. We are still complaining.

Why? Because **a utopia is an idea that lives only in our mind**, impossible to manifest.

It doesn't matter what we do here—the things we imagine in our mind will **never be exactly here as we expect**.

We will always have something to improve.

### Each Person's Utopia

As much as we gain the ability to be free of thinking (not pressed by the thoughts of others or the beliefs of others), and we start to believe in ourselves, **each individual will have their own idea**—their own utopia.

It will **never be enough** to make everyone happy ever.

---

## The Real Purpose of Utopia

### Not to Arrive, But to Move

The idea of utopia is **not to arrive at a place**. It was made to ask us to **move forward**.

How many of us have been living thinking, "How am I going to leave change? Am I going to be able to enjoy all this effort we are doing?"

Many people have died thinking that during the process of change, thinking it was not enough because it was not like they had it in their minds.

### Missing the Present

When we live our lives just thinking about reaching our utopia, **we are missing the important thing**: that the change is happening **right around us, not in front**.

### Matias's Example

Matias shares: what we are doing now—speaking about all this, in a Muslim country, being homosexual, and his organization all ruled by women—**how?** In another time, he would have been in jail.

**This is the utopia we are living.**

"I cannot expect anymore."

---

## Understanding Utopia Correctly

### We Must Keep Working

The important thing to understand is that **what we are doing is already perfect**. It doesn't mean we should not do anything for the future.

We have to do things. We have to work a lot. We have to do many things to get better, to transform, to change.

We have **many things to do**, of course.

### But Perfection Is Not in the Future

But it doesn't mean the perfection is in front. It doesn't mean it's in the future where we will see the results.

**We have to keep doing things and getting better**, but we have to realize that **what we are living is our utopia**.

We have accomplished many things.

### Not Waiting for the Future

If we are all the time thinking about the perfection of the future, we are not understanding all we have accomplished.

Remember what we spoke about these days: **nothing exists**. Nothing really exists. There is nothing here. This is just an image, an idea of something (dimension zero).

---

## Utopia and Dimensions

### No Time and Space

If nothing really exists, this means there is **no time and space** in the basis of the universe.

Which means **everything is utopia**. Everything.

We are utopian.

### Why Put It in the Future?

Why should we put utopia ahead in the future, in front, if we can **download it here and now**?

Remember: the reason we put utopia in front of us is because in our history as mammals, we were looking for that imaginary place in front of the horizon.

But in the universe, **there is no horizon**. There is no time.

So **why put it ahead if it is everywhere**?

---

## Utopia, Soul, and Body

### The Dream That Creates

Utopia moves the soul in order to create the body.

Utopia is this constant **ticking of being something different**, of transforming ourselves, to find different ways of being.

It is an idea, like a dream, that **pushes forward**.

### Not a Place of Perfection

It is not a place where we have to go. It is not a place of perfection.

**Utopia is a dream that creates us.**

---

## Pisces and Utopia

### Pisces Doesn't Seek Utopia Ahead

This is a good thing to understand about the attributes of Pisces.

**Pisces is not looking for that utopia in front.** Pisces is trying to **live that utopia here**, now.

By loving everyone unconditionally, by living this love, doing everything they can for the rest, **living it here and now**.

### Building Utopia Now

We cannot build utopia by willing to accomplish goals in the future.

The way we accomplish our goals is by **enjoying them and choosing them here and now**, choosing what we love.

---

## Enlightenment as Utopia

### Seeking Enlightenment

For example, to seek enlightenment: when you are looking for enlightenment like, "Let's run to get to the seventh dimension to find enlightenment..."

When you are willing to find enlightenment in that way, **you are forgetting something really important**: the seventh dimension is not a place you can go.

### Enlightenment Is Within

It is the **light you can feel within**.

You enlighten yourself by acknowledging that **you are all that**.

The seventh dimension is the enlightenment, the shining process, where you put together all what you are.

**What is the goal of running to do that when you already are that?**

### Mammalian Thinking

Enlightenment, seeking enlightenment in the future, is the way a **mammal** understands utopia.

---

## Matias's Utopia: Own Democracy

### Not Global Peace

Matias has his own utopia, which is **own democracy**—a social system he is imagining in his head for the future.

His utopia is not spiritual, not about global peace. "That's too much. I don't know."

He's thinking just about willing to build a **system that could help transcend the actual social systems**.

### It Must Remain Utopia

The problem would be if he believed that utopia is the best one, the only system that can help.

Actually, his utopia (own democracy) **doesn't have a specific ideology**—political, cultural, or otherwise.

Because the concept of this utopia is for it to **keep being a utopia** so we can improve, so we can get better once and again.

### When Utopia Becomes Dogma

When you just think "this is the perfect system," that's when it doesn't work.

**The basis of utopia is that we can keep transforming ourselves**, not that it should be perfect.

---

## Two Aspects of Utopia

### For Humans: Motivation

From the point of view of humans, **utopia is the motivation** we have to move forward, to transform ourselves constantly.

### For the Cosmos: Everything

From the point of view of the cosmos, **utopia is everything**, because nothing really exists.

Everything is just a dream.

### Becoming the Dreamer

If we become aware of the dream, **we become the dreamer**, able to live our own utopia.

---

## Utopia and Purpose

### Purpose Ahead

Here comes the idea of **purpose**. Remember: to put something ahead.

Utopia is the **purpose that keeps us transforming ourselves**.

And in the universe, if there is no ahead, the purpose can be only one thing: **oneself**.

---

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortable. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. Pay attention to the energy of your body, feeling it like waves of heat and cold.

### Perceiving Emotions as Energy

Recognize that this emotion is the energy that comes from the magnetism that emerges from the particles that create the atoms that constitute your body.

Recognize and become aware that all your emotions and energies are nothing else but **forces that emerge from the void between your atoms**.

### Expanding to the Cosmos

Take a breath and expand this energy toward the cosmos, letting your body dissolve, like a star exploding in the universe.

Let yourself breathe. Let yourself feel nothing, expanded in the cosmos.

### Recognizing Yourself as Utopia

Recognize yourself as **the utopia of the universe online**.

Become aware that this utopia is nothing from the future. It is nothing, the perfection of the future.

**It is right here, now, in me.**

And **I can create it today**.

### You Are the Purpose

Recognize: **I am the only one able to find and create the purpose** that takes me to utopia.

Take a breath. Imagine this utopia. Use all these atoms you expanded of yourself, and imagine creating this utopia, this perfection of yourself, expanded outside, around, within.

### The Vibration Pae

Sound the vibration **Pae** from your third eye.

**I am the will of purpose. I am the will of purpose. I am the will of purpose.**

See the utopia manifesting. See yourself creating your purpose.

### Closing

Expand this consciousness throughout all the body and all yourself. Come back here and now, each one at your own time.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, stop for a moment and recognize: **what utopia are you living right now?**

What would have been impossible for people 50, 100, 300 years ago that you take for granted today?

The freedom to think your own thoughts, speak your mind, choose your path—these were utopian dreams not long ago.

### Shifting Perspective

Instead of asking, "When will I reach my perfect life?" ask, "**How is my life already perfect?**"

This doesn't mean stop working for change. It means **recognize what has already changed** while you continue transforming.

### Your Personal Utopia

What is your utopia? Write it down. Dream it fully.

Then ask: **How can I live aspects of this utopia today?**

If your utopia is world peace, how can you create peace in your home today? If your utopia is enlightenment, how can you be light today?

---

## Week Context

We are in the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where we dissolve the boundaries between dream and reality, between what is and what could be.

Pisces holds the vision of utopia not as a distant goal but as a **present reality we choose to embody**. Unconditional love is Pisces's way of living utopia now, not waiting for a perfect future.

The third eye chakra allows us to **see beyond** what is visible, to imagine what could be, and to recognize that **we are already living in the dream**.

---

## Q&A

### Q: If utopia is impossible to reach, why bother working toward it?

Because **utopia is not a destination—it's the motivation** that keeps you evolving. You don't work toward utopia to arrive there; you work toward it to **become more** than you are now. The journey is the point, not the arrival.

### Q: How can I enjoy the present if I know things could be better?

By recognizing that "could be better" will **always be true**, no matter how much improves. If you wait for perfection to enjoy life, you will never enjoy it. Enjoy **what is** while working toward **what could be**—both at once.

### Q: Isn't it defeatist to say utopia doesn't exist?

No. It's **liberating**. Utopia exists as an idea, a dream, a vision—and that's enough. You don't need it to be a physical place to let it inspire you. The dream creates you; you don't need to reach it to benefit from it.

### Q: How is Pisces different from other signs regarding utopia?

Other signs seek utopia **ahead**—in the future, in heaven, after death. Pisces seeks to **embody utopia now**, through unconditional love and service. Pisces doesn't wait for the perfect world; Pisces creates it through present action.

### Q: What if my utopia conflicts with someone else's?

It will. **Everyone has their own utopia**, which is why no single vision will ever satisfy everyone. This is not a problem—it's a feature. The diversity of utopias keeps humanity evolving in multiple directions simultaneously.

### Q: How does utopia relate to the void we discussed yesterday?

The void teaches that **nothing has inherent meaning**. Utopia is the dream you create **from that void**. Because nothing is predetermined, you are free to dream any future you want. Utopia is your will manifesting from the freedom of the void.

### Q: Is enlightenment a utopia?

If you seek it as a **future destination**, yes—it's a utopia you'll never reach. If you recognize it as a **present reality** (you are already the light), then it's not utopia but truth. The seventh dimension is not ahead; it's within.
