## Introduction

Hi everyone.

So I just forgot which day was today.

So Sunday.

So thank you all who are here on a Sunday watching me here listening to me and doing this with me.

So thank you for this and not being doing other things because it 's Sunday. But anyway , some of you may be are quarantine so it 's the same.

So today we have to work with the with the Lexus but in the physical aspect so it will be the pancreas.

So I was just thinking in Spanish that maybe some of you would see that that my hair is more fine now and this is because it 's been big when I have learned how to wash my hair.

So it 's been like 25 years I 've been washing it wrong and never still late to learn something and but I 'm alone so I have to learn how to wash myself again. Anyway , nobody here to smell. Once I said this , let 's go to work with the information of today. We have been working yesterday with the heart and now we work with the Lexus.

It 's the chara that helps us to be related with external reality and also to bring all information from the external to the inner reality to integrate it within ourselves.

Today in today 's post on the blog I wrote about falling in love. Usually we may think that the love we as humans believe that love is something related with the heart but it 's more related with the Lexus. Basically the reason why we used to relate love with the heart is because when we feel that emotion what happens is that the pulse is the electrical pulses of the body starts to push the heart to the heart to dilute.

Sorry. And we did n't. To expand dictate?

Okay. The heart starts to dictate and contract so the veins can push for blood around so we feel like the heartbeat. This brings and this takes all the blood all around to feed the organs and the muscles with nutrients and so on.

So this is kind of a not lovely way to describe how we feel love. All blood and running and heart dilatating is but it 's like that.

So basically the reason why we relate the heart with this is because the heart is just pushing and moving the blood around but it 's not because of the heart. It 's because of the need of each one of the cells to absorb the nutrients and the sugar okay that has the energy to make us feel full plenty and that 's what we call love that feeling.

So basically the one that needs to absorb these nutrients from the blood is the pancreas that sends the insulin to the blood so it could catch the sugar in the blood so it could go and feed the cells.

## Q&A

So basically who asked for the heart to beat faster so it could distribute , it could distribute blood perfectly around the whole body would be the pancreas.

So to fall in love would be that feeling that we may have felt someday which we used to call to feeling butterflies in the stomach. Basically when we call it we would say this sentence that is full belly , happy heart. I do n't know if you have it in English but when we say that it 's because we culturally relate to being in love with feeling plenty , with feeling full.

So I have everything that I need , I am full of everything so it 's like you have each and everything that you need it so that 's why your heart is happy. Basically what the body does is to we say that that we feel ourselves plenty and full when we fell in love because our body identify to be in love with having very well.

So this is why this is a funny way to kill romanticism but anyway it 's kind of how it is.

So what we relate with to falling in love is the sick of feeling yourself full or plenty. And this is why through all the history we have related love with food.

So basically since we are born in this world we relate the first love of our life with the mother and the love of the mother is because other gives you the milk , the first meal that you have.

So you relate the first meal with the love from one.

So another thing is I recognize the love of the family when we see it all together to have a meal , to eat.

So eating unite us.

So this is why in most of the cultures one of the biggest proofs of love that you have with someone is to invite that someone to eat. I guess that happened to you. We usually when we want to show love to our friends to some new , whatever the thing that we used to do is to invite them for dinner , invite them for a meal to go to drink something. This is also something that we relate with the first date.

Like to go out for dinner to eat something. Maybe you bought or someone bought you chocolate sugar.

So basically now you can picture that in all of the cultures we relate with eating. And the reason why this happens is because who interprets love in our body is the pancreas. And the reason why this happens is because the pancreas creates the insulin that will catch the carbohydrates. How do you say that in English?

I do n't know. The cars maybe. The calories , the sugar , the glucose in the blood.

So it could create the energy to feed the cells. About pulling love while we are describing from the point of view of the soul is the process of the emotional insulin.

Now we should n't say I love you with all my heart. We should say I love you with all my pancreas. Maybe we 'll be like we 're but we will be very original. What it is to fall in love then.

To fall in love is the process that begins when my spirit , my soul , myself. It starts to need something in order to evolve , to go to move forward. And so it jumps to the outside to look for that energy that can help me to fulfill that need. Maybe you have noticed this , but when you fell in love , you feel a lot of energy to do many things.

The reason why we feel like this is because we are acquiring that energy from the outside and we have a lot of energy within to make things because we have processed this energy inside our body.

So we would say that love is the glucose of the universe. I am destroying the romanticism in ten minutes.

So this means that what we are doing we get in love is to assimilate energy to accomplish our goals , our purpose in life. This is why when we get in love and suddenly we accomplish where we were into a complex we stop being in love and suddenly we do n't feel much more love.

So one of the paths from that moment when you stop falling in love , this path is when you say I had accomplished everything so I do n't need this person anymore. I do n't love this person or this thing anymore. I just fall in love for other things or for other person.

Sometimes what we can feel is that the person makes us remember so much about our oldest eye , the myself from the past , that we feel that that person is pushing us back. And this is the moment when we stop falling in love with that person and suddenly we just hate that person. But it 's not that we hate that person. Instead what happens is that that person remembers reminds us about our old self.

So basically to fall in love is to have the energy to be able to transform yourself constantly into new things.

So this is why when we have an environment that is constantly the same we stop being in love and we are hungry. This is one of the sentences that we can use that like I am hungry for new things , for new emotions.

So this is good because we learn that we need to change the environment in order to go ahead to transform ourselves. The problem that we have in our cultures is that we put the partnership , we put the marriage in the level of divinity. We kind of romanticism the concept of the partner. This is the thing that we created as the idea that we have to find someone that makes us feel like complete and then I have to respect that someone until I die.

But this is not something universal. This is something very cultural from our time.

So the reason why today is so important for us is because most of the localized civilization that we have today were born from the monotheistic religion.

So they had to create this idea. But most of the cultures from the past did n't have that. And also for example we took the idea of the twin souls or twin flames , I do n't know how to call it. And we also romanticized that like if it is something from our culture , from the Indo-European cultures.

When for sure the for example the twin souls are more related with the universal metastasis than with the love of partners of two people.

So basically what we used to express and project in the universe is mostly a projection from our cultures. All the things that we used to call like the partnership , the marriage , they are all institutions from our cultures and society. But they have nothing in common with our body , with what we really are.

So this is why when I become aware myself and suddenly I get in , I fall in love with my own self is where , is the moment when the most of the divorces happens in our society.

So basically we have come here to this reality to transform ourselves constantly.

So to be constantly in the same way basically keeps us trapped in limitations. But remember I was just talking about this path.

Now we are going to speak about this path.

So unconditional love would be that I understand why that person appears in my life and what 's the purpose of that person in my life or that thing in my life. And suddenly I just there myself to fall in love again by creating a project and you think ahead for both of us. Or I can look for another thing for another person for another thing to do. But still being in love and to love that other person as a partner for the whole life.

So by unconditional love I do n't break and escape from the system. What I do is to transform the system and integrate the system.

So in unconditional love what happens is that you understand that you can do other things that you can love that person and to create a new project to fall in love together. Or suddenly you just realize that you can become , even if you split , you can become best friends because now you understood the importance of that person and you can still love it. But also what you can do is just to say I do n't want to live this person but I know I have to do something different.

So maybe you have to take a trip for your own to do something different to do something new by yourself in order to get that falling in love again with life.

So this is not specifically related with people , with partner marriage. Can be any person , can be any concept. Maybe you can fall in love with your work. Maybe it 's just other things.

It should be things from where you take energy to keep going to transform yourself.

So when I feel that I had n't been loved , when I can not love myself , when I can not do new things and I feel stuck and I do n't feel the energy that makes me feel alive , all of that energy , all of that knowledge would be the things that made my pancreas get ill.

So basically when you have a problem , if you have any problem in the pancreas , you have to think about what is your relationship with us through love. If you are able to love , if nobody is loving you , if you have all your problems in your relationships with everybody.

So now we can picture that falling in love and being in love is not something from the heart and that you can feel from one person to another. It 's basically your being trying to have the energy in order to do things. And that energy comes from the universe.

So this is why the questions that we have to do for today is how it was the first time we fell in love. How was the first time we fell in love?

So try to remember what have you felt with that love , what have you projected with that love?

So remember that the first time that we fell in love in our lives would describe the idea of how our body interpreted that it loves to eat. That 's the way in which the body wants to eat.

So the reason why we need to understand this time we fell in love is because through our life we start to repeat the same things once and again when we fell in love. This is because it 's our favorite dish.

So now I will say an example that maybe all the descendants from Italy would hate that it is imagine that the first dish , the first meal that you just loved. Any pizza is a pizza but it 's not any pizza. It 's the pizza with anna.

So you may say a lot of banana pizza and suddenly everyone mostly Italians would say how and you enjoy that it 's disgusting but you would say no , no I love the pizza with pineapple. I love it. I love pineapple , I love pizza both together , I love it. All the people would say that that 's disgusting but you keep doing it , you keep eating it because it was the first pizza you ever chased and it was good.

So this is how the first time we fell in love would be exactly the same as our favorite dish because it 's like you will also ask for that dish through your life. But it 's important , it 's important. This is why it 's so important to go back and to understand how was the first encounter with the concept of falling in love in your life. Once I said this I just want to eat a pizza with pineapple right now.

But anyway , I do n't have pizza with pineapple here. Let 's go to the land. The vibration of today is the sound seal. The code for today is the soul pattern PA and it says , we have the food that keeps us in the physical life that the universe created , the energy of the soul , the flourishes with the energy of the matter we consume.

The PA sound radiated in the physical food , the one that keeps us alive , those that we need to sublist in a physical body , the feel of life.

So it 's related with what we have spoken today.

So seal , I am a great of entities. Let 's go to that.

So as always we sit in a comfortable position and we begin messaging the body. Stretch the body , young , a psycho is the body. I think the body for being the physical expression of the spirit in the matter. Let the weight of your body fall down.

Take a deep breath and start to focus only in your breathing. I am aware of the oxygen coming inside my body by each breathing through my nose , to the lungs , heart , blood , organs and muscles. Take a deep breath and become aware of the energy of the body. Of each one of the cells , the thousands of the cells that build my body.

And feel one of them , the ones that calls your attention and head towards that. I get closer to this cell until I see it as a sphere in front of me. Very big. And I recognize this is some others.

Take a deep breath and dive within the cell until you float in the cell. And from the core of the cell , take the chromosomes , it starts to enroll it until you feel the change of the end , all through your fingers. Those are the codes that makes you be who you are. And now I recognize watching around that I am within the body of my mother.

In the cell , the now began. And above me , I perceive the light of the eye , heading towards me with the shape of the spiral , the body of an aspermato sword. I perceive the spermatosolio touching the limit of the cell , changing its polarity , making it shine as a sun. Take a deep breath and allow this aspermato sword , shining with the light of the eye out , to come within my body.

## Energy Work

Take a deep breath and perceive the spiral light of the eye out , coming through the crown , the third eye , the third heart and plexus. And from there , its shinnentical material starts to be spread towards the sacrament , the root , the need and feet. And because of this , I start to perceive how my cell starts to divide , doing meiosis. From my point of view , my cell is I.

And in front of me , the other cell of the ring is I am. I become aware that from this point , my cells are going to be spread and expanded , looking for the energy that feeder , feed the cells , to expand , to grow and to create.

So this is the moment when I recognize that myself starts to fall in love , life. I acknowledge this by love , I feel how these two cells divide and form , and then in age , so in sixteen , so on and on , looking for the creation of the organs on the body. Once I feel the cells expand , I perceive how they create the organs. Hard , long , time-pest , rain , stomach , intestines.

Every organ , muscle and bone. I become aware that the love of the spirit has become in the energy of the soul , that now is the meal , cell.

So all my body is built by love and each one of the cells in my body is in love with me. There 's source of energy. Everything that I do now , everything that I love now , will create love for life. I become aware of my feet , my legs , hands and arms on my head.

And with sound , I start to push for my love to the beyond. I keep my hands in the sound.

So I go outside , the body of the mother , feeling the light in the crying , their eye , throat , and the plexus. I feel half of your body outside in their. And it 's now with the plexus outside that I recognize that every person , every being that will get to love in my life , will build what I am , will feed them. For I am agreed of entities.

I recognize that I am love and everything I fall in love in my life will feed what I am.

So I remember I am agreed of entities. All of them united with me , with unconditional love. Take a deep breath and begin to bring all this information through all your body. Messaging , creating , stretching and joining.

So remember , drink a little water and rest a lot so you can integrate this information.

So from all the love of my pancreas , see you tomorrow at the same time as always. See you tomorrow.
