## Overview

Day 102 continues the emotional week of Scorpio, now focusing on the third eye chakra. Today we explore one of the most misunderstood concepts in spiritual work: resentment. Before diving into this teaching, Matias shares information about the channeling from Day 100 (11/11), where a being from the Hathor energy appeared.

The Hathor beings represent the beauty of light and are connected to Egyptian mythology as the mother energy, the cow that gives milk to the whole entity and creates the sky. They built the cube of creation—the cube of nine dimensions—through singing. One dimension sits in the center, with eight surrounding it to create the cube, representing all dimensions of reality. Four above represent time (the sky, the stars in this time), and four below represent space (the river, the flow of now).

The main teaching focuses on resentment, revealing that we are ALL resentful people. The word "resentment" comes from Latin: "re" (again, to go back) and "sentiment" (feeling). To resent literally means "to feel again." We constantly repeat the same feelings throughout our lives, going back to our history and bringing those same feelings into the present, living today through the feelings we felt yesterday.

## Core Teaching

### The Hathor Channeling: Cube of Creation

Before we dive into resentment, it's important to understand the information shared during the 11/11 channeling. The being who came through was one of the Hathor energies—beings from the part of the Goddess Hathor (Author in Egyptian).

In Egypt they call it Hathor, but it's not just one being—it's a concept that connects many beings with that information. There are many beings that are Hathor, called that because they represent the beauty of light. That's why Hathor—that's their name.

They are related in Egyptian mythology to Hathor, the mother, the energy of the cow that gives milk to the whole entity, that creates the sky. They built the **cube of creation**—the cube of dimensions, nine dimensions—by singing. They activate through singing.

The cube is a representation of the nine dimensions. We have one dimension in the center, and then we have eight around it, creating a cube—basically all the dimensions of reality.

**Four of them above represent time**, and **four below represent space**. The time ones represent the sky, the stars that we have in this time. Below, we have the river, the river of now—the flow of the present moment.

One of the things the Hathor being was doing was sharing the concept of connecting heaven and earth—like 11/11, bringing both together as one in ourselves, creating the center in the cube. Connecting us through all the dimensions, through time and space, with the shape of the cube.

The information shared was extensive, and Matias admits he couldn't remember it all in the moment (as is typical with channeling). The key teaching was about the cube connecting all dimensions and how singing activates this dimensional structure.

### What is Resentment? We Are All Resentful

Now we come to today's core teaching. First, understand this: **we all are people with resentment**. All of you, myself, and everyone who will listen to this—we are all resentful people.

Why is that?

Because "re" means to go back to, or to do again. And "sentiment" comes from "feeling" in Latin. **Resentment means to feel again.**

We all are resentful because we all feel the same things throughout our whole life. We repeat constantly the same feelings, once again, once again. We go back to our history, go back to our history, and we bring all the same feelings to the present. We live our lives today through the feelings that we have felt before.

**That's resentment.**

### Rancor: The Smell of Old Emotions

In English, you also have "rancor." Rancor comes from "rancid"—something that smells old, like something so old that you cannot feel it, it's not good to smell.

Basically, rancor (which originates from the word rancid) means **old emotions that have gone bad**, like food left too long. It's the stale, spoiled quality of emotions we've held onto for too long.

When we talk about being resentful or having rancor, we're talking about emotions that have aged poorly within us, emotions we keep re-feeling instead of processing and releasing.

### We Live Through Yesterday's Feelings

Think about this carefully: How many times do you respond to today's situations with yesterday's emotions?

Someone says something that reminds you of a past hurt, and instantly you feel that same hurt again—even though the current situation is different. You're not feeling the present moment; you're re-feeling the past.

A situation arises that resembles something from your childhood, and you respond with the same fear, anger, or sadness you felt then. You're not responding to now; you're re-experiencing then.

This is what it means to be resentful. We carry our emotional history with us and keep re-playing it, re-feeling it, re-living it. The feelings become rancid because they're old, stale, no longer fresh or appropriate to the present moment.

### Why We Keep Re-Feeling

We re-feel for several reasons:

1. **Unprocessed emotions**: We never fully felt, understood, or released the original emotion, so it stays active in our system, waiting to be triggered.

2. **Pattern recognition**: Our third eye (the chakra focus for today) recognizes patterns. When it sees something similar to a past experience, it recalls the associated emotion.

3. **Protection mechanism**: Sometimes we re-feel old emotions as a warning system—"This situation reminds me of when I got hurt before, so be careful."

4. **Unconscious habit**: We've felt this emotion so many times in response to similar situations that it's become automatic, unconscious.

The problem is not that we have these feelings, but that we're not conscious of when we're re-feeling versus feeling freshly in the present moment.

### The Third Eye and Resentment

Today we work with the third eye chakra, which is the center of perception, vision, and pattern recognition. The third eye sees connections between past and present, between this experience and previous ones.

This is valuable—it helps us learn from experience. But it can also trap us in resentment if we're not careful. The third eye might say, "This is like that time when..." and suddenly we're feeling the old emotion instead of perceiving the new situation freshly.

In Scorpio's dark water, these re-felt emotions accumulate. They settle in the depths, in the invisible emotional waters we carry. The third eye perceives them, recognizes them, and can either help us become conscious of the pattern or trap us in repeating it.

### Breaking Free from Re-Sentiment

The key to working with resentment is not to eliminate old feelings but to become conscious of when we're re-feeling them.

**Consciousness breaks the automatic pattern.** When you can recognize, "Oh, this feeling I'm having right now is not about this situation—it's about something from my past that this situation reminds me of," you create space. You create choice.

You can acknowledge the old feeling: "Yes, I remember that hurt. I remember that fear. I felt it before." And then you can ask: "But what do I actually feel about THIS situation, right here, right now, freshly?"

This doesn't mean the old feeling disappears. It means you're no longer trapped in unconsciously re-experiencing it. You can feel it consciously, recognize it for what it is, and choose how to respond in the present.

## Practice

### Resentment Awareness Meditation

This practice helps you identify when you're re-feeling old emotions versus feeling fresh in the present moment.

**Preparation:**
- Sit comfortably
- Close your eyes
- Bring attention to your third eye (between and slightly above your eyebrows)
- Take several deep breaths

**The Practice:**

1. **Scan for current emotions** (5 minutes)
   - Notice what emotions you're carrying right now
   - Don't judge them, just notice
   - Name them: sadness, anger, fear, joy, etc.

2. **Trace each emotion backward** (10 minutes)
   - Pick one emotion you're feeling
   - Ask: "When did I first feel this?"
   - Let your third eye show you memories
   - Notice if this is a familiar feeling
   - How many times have you felt this exact emotion?
   - Is this emotion about now, or are you re-feeling something old?

3. **Distinguish old from new** (5 minutes)
   - Ask: "What part of this feeling is from the past?"
   - Ask: "What part of this feeling is genuinely about my present situation?"
   - Notice the difference
   - The old feeling will have a "stale" quality, like rancor
   - The fresh feeling will be more immediate, more alive

4. **Release with awareness** (5 minutes)
   - To the old emotion, say: "I see you. I felt you before. Thank you for trying to protect me."
   - To the fresh emotion, say: "I feel you now, in this moment, and I will respond from here."
   - Breathe deeply
   - Let the old emotion settle back into the dark water
   - Stay present with what's actually happening now

5. **Integration** (3 minutes)
   - Place hand on third eye
   - Acknowledge: "I am aware when I re-feel"
   - Commit: "I will notice the difference between old and new emotions"
   - Open eyes slowly

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Re-Sentiment Tracking:**

Keep a journal this week. Each time you have a strong emotional reaction to something, write:
1. What happened (the trigger)
2. What emotion you felt
3. Does this emotion feel familiar?
4. When have you felt this exact feeling before?
5. Is this emotion about NOW, or are you re-feeling something OLD?

Notice patterns. You'll likely find you have 3-5 core emotions you keep re-feeling in different situations.

### Weekly Focus

As you continue through Scorpio's emotional week, pay special attention to resentment. The dark waters of Scorpio hold all our re-felt emotions, all the feelings we've experienced over and over.

This week is about bringing consciousness to the depths. Not to eliminate the emotions stored there, but to become aware of when we're unconsciously replaying them.

### Living the Teaching

Resentment is not the enemy. It's simply unconscious re-feeling. When you make it conscious—when you recognize, "I'm feeling this again"—it loses its automatic power over you.

You can still feel the emotion. But now you feel it with awareness, with choice. You can acknowledge the old hurt and still choose how to respond in the present. This is the gift of working with the third eye in Scorpio's waters.

## Q&A

**Q: If we're all resentful, does that mean resentment is normal and we shouldn't try to change it?**

A: Resentment is normal in the sense that it's universal—we all do it. But becoming conscious of it transforms it. You're not trying to stop having emotions or to erase your history. You're learning to distinguish between unconsciously re-feeling old emotions and consciously feeling present emotions. This awareness is what creates change.

**Q: How do I know if an emotion is old or new?**

A: Old emotions have a familiar, repetitive quality—you've felt this exact feeling many times before. They often feel "heavy" or "stale" (rancid). New emotions feel fresh, immediate, alive—they're a genuine response to what's actually happening now. With practice, your third eye learns to distinguish them instantly.

**Q: What if an old emotion is legitimate—like if someone keeps hurting me the same way?**

A: Then you're having a fresh, appropriate emotional response to a repeated pattern of harm. The emotion is new each time, even if the situation is similar. But notice the difference: Are you feeling hurt because of what they just did, or are you re-feeling the accumulated hurt from all the times before? This distinction matters for how you respond.

**Q: Can resentment ever be useful?**

A: Yes, when it's conscious. Recognizing "I've felt this before, and it didn't go well" can be protective wisdom. The problem is unconscious resentment, where you're automatically replaying old emotions without awareness. Conscious re-feeling says, "I remember what happened last time, and I choose to respond differently this time."

**Q: What's the connection between resentment and the third eye chakra?**

A: The third eye perceives patterns and connections. It sees how today's situation resembles yesterday's. This pattern recognition is valuable for learning, but it can also trigger automatic emotional replays. When the third eye functions consciously, it helps you see the pattern without being trapped by it. You can think, "This reminds me of that, but they're not the same thing."

**Q: How does the Hathor channeling about the cube relate to resentment?**

A: The cube represents all dimensions—time (past) and space (present). Resentment is when we collapse these dimensions, bringing past emotions into present space. The teaching about connecting heaven and earth, time and space, as one is about integrating our history (time) with our now (space) consciously, not unconsciously re-living the past in the present.

**Q: What does it mean that the cube was built through singing?**

A: Sound, vibration, singing—these are creative forces that structure reality. The Hathors used sound to build the dimensional framework. Similarly, we use our emotional "songs"—the feelings we repeatedly express—to build our reality. When we keep singing the same old emotional songs (resentment), we keep building the same old reality. New songs create new structures.

**Q: Is there a difference between resentment and holding a grudge?**

A: A grudge is a specific form of resentment—it's when you consciously hold onto and re-feel anger or hurt toward a specific person or situation. Resentment, as taught here, is broader: it's the general pattern of re-feeling any emotion from the past, whether toward others or not. You can resent (re-feel) fear, sadness, even joy—any emotion you unconsciously replay.

## Closing Reflection

Day 102 reveals something profound: we are all walking around re-feeling our emotional histories. We think we're experiencing the present, but often we're replaying the past.

This is not a failing. It's human. We are made of wet lands, and those wet lands hold our emotional history like water holds memory. The question is not whether we'll re-feel, but whether we'll do so consciously or unconsciously.

The third eye, working in Scorpio's dark waters, can illuminate these patterns. It can help us see when we're replaying old emotional scripts. And in that seeing, in that awareness, we find freedom—not freedom from feeling, but freedom to feel freshly, to respond to what's actually happening now rather than what happened then.

As you move through this day, notice: Which emotions am I re-feeling? Which are fresh? Can I tell the difference? Can I honor both without being trapped by either?

The Hathor beings sang the cube of creation into existence. What emotional songs are you singing into existence through your resentments? And what new songs might you choose to sing instead?

*Day 102: Learning to feel fresh in the dark waters of old emotions.*
