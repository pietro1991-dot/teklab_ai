## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra:** `Third Eye`

## Introduction

So now , we begin with morning , good afternoon , good evening. Welcome all of you to the emotional week of Scorpio , in the third eye. I said that I would explain a little bit about the channeling from today 's ago.

So , two days ago , in 1111 , the being that I was channeling was one of the beings from the part of the Goddess Author , in Egypt they call it Author. In Egypt they call it Author , but it 's not , I 'm going to say , it 's the concept that connects many beings with that information.

So there are many beings that are Author , and they are called like that , because they represent the beauty of light. That 's why Author , that 's their name , Author.

So they are related to the Egyptian mythology with Author , which is the mother , the energy of the cow that gives the milk to the whole entity , that creates the sky. Well , we 'll be all of that.

So what they used to do , or they relate to , is about the human nature. They built the cube of creation , the cube of dimensions , nine dimensions , but the singing by the sounds.

So they activate singing. Oops , they sing it.

Sorry , I was trying to remember what she said , and I ca n't remember anything.

So I had an idea what she said. No idea what it was doing for me. I am the worst child in history. Basically , basically , I was generally an Author , and I was in pain and tension.

I had an idea what she said. That 's how I remember what she said.

So basically , the concept , I do n't remember exactly what she said , but the concept that I remember that she was showing is about the cube. The cube is some representation of the ninth dimensions. We have one dimension in the center , and then we have eight around , creating a cube. Basically , all the dimensions of the reality.

So four of them , above , represents the time and above them below represents the space.

So the time one represents the sky , the stars , that we have in this time. And below , we have the river , the river now.

So one of the things that she was doing , like sharing the concept , was to connect heaven and earth , like 1111 , to both together as one in ourselves , creating the center in the cube.

So that would mainly. Connecting us through all the dimensions through the time and space with the shape of the cube.

Now I remember something about the information that she said , and but it 's too much to explain right now.

So I would rather write it down and then share it with you , and that would be better. Obviously , I am the worst remember of the history , because I ca n't remember what I did yesterday.

So it 's terrible.

So tomorrow , I will try to write down the blog , a summary of , for me , that we have received this two days. But I would like to go now to the information that we have to talk about today. Which is resentment. I was just saying that in Spanish , we can also use resentment , which is a mean to.

But a recording Spanish goes much more deeper in which in terms that I wanted to explain.

So first of all , I would like to say to you that for sure everyone here , all of you , myself and everyone who is going to listen after this , we all are people with resentment. We all are , how do you say , resentful people?

Something like that. And why is that? Because , re means to go back to or to do it again , and sentiment comes from feeling in Latin , okay? This means to feel again.

And we all are resentful. Thank you. We are all resentful because , because we all used to feel the same things like in our whole life. We repeat constantly the same feelings.

Once again , once again. We go back to our history and about our history and we bring all the same feelings to the present and we leave our lives today through the feelings that we have felt us.

So that 's resentment.

So in English , you also have a rank or , I do n't know if you use it much , but rank or comes from the , from the , rcid , okay? That 's the origin of the word.

So something that smells like old , like something that it 's so old that you can not , that you can not , feel it , it 's not good to smell.

So basically , rank or , which is the , it 's originated by the word rcid. It 's an old smell from something that is very old , that is rotten. And then now , you start to feel it again , like when you play it and it 's , feel gaseous or you do n't want to feel it , and it makes you feel uncomfortable , that would be cancer , resentment.

So first of , let 's go to the biology , because this will help us to understand from where it can , from where it 's coming , and then the reason why it 's is perception of smell.

So we could , we could work later with the emotional.

So the main thing to remember , and I will repeat this constantly , is that the body is , to survive.

So the body is built to protect everything , inside , so it could leave as long as possible.

Okay , we have to remember this all the time. And because of this , the body is , thin , all information , as much it can from the whole environment.

So it ca n't later , repeat the code , to survive.

So it does n't have to learn each time , different things. It 's just a quiet information , and that 's it. Then everything will be started to the first things that , that the body absorbs. Like for example , we have explained that , if you touch the fire for the first time in your life , you will get burned , and suddenly you will like , oh , it burned me , so it 's bad.

So all your life , your body , will react to fire , because of that same , feeling that you got.

So your body is , stating energy , by the experiences that you have.

So it says , okay , I see fire , so remember , it 's basically what the body is doing.

So we can relate this , we can relate this to the first seven years of our life. The seventh , the seventh , first years of our life , the first septanim. Is the most important in which everyone can learn a lot of things. We humans are spawn , bringing as much as information as we can from all around , because we are learning how to survive in this environment.

That 's why we use to save that. That keeps learning faster , is because the whole body , not just in , is the butt trying to absorb information. But after the seven years old , we start to repeat the codes , like anything that could happen after our seven days , will be compared with something that happened before I was seven years old. And that , how we create this.

Storage of information of data. This is why , during this , decades of our life , everything that happens to us will be related to what happened to us in this first set year of our life. This is why it 's so important this seven years.

So after our seven years old , of course , we will leave different things , good and bad things. And all of them , it will be forged , inside our body , as a new data. But once it storage , it will be the base to all the other information that are similar to that.

Okay.

So all this information that we storage for our survival is registered in the hypothalamus. And from the hypothalamus , in the center of the brain , the reptilian brain , are born also , the two main important glands , which are the hypothesis and the lineal gland. And the , are the ones that regulate control the whole endocrine out system and the screen system.

So basically the whole body. This brain is the , this here , the one in the core , is the one registered everything.

So this means that the whole system needs a lot of good cells , absolutely information from the outside , because the way in which you storage information is from the outside to the inside.

So you need to bring that information inside. And why , through , through thousands of years of evolution , we started to create the cells that will storage that information.

So this billions of , these , of evolution , created this cells that will storage information to the main core through , the hearing , the side , smelling , and taste. And of course , by the skin , we have the fifth , which is the touch.

## Guided Meditation

So basically , head has these five senses , so it could bring as much as information to the inner brain. In mammals , the most evolved senses is the smell. And for us , for humans , we used to say that smell is the way in which you can contact with the spirit and the soul , because the soul is the air , you breathe , and breathing , and breathing , in Latin is the spirit. Because it 's straight related to the , to the lineal gland.

So one important thing to understand why for mammals is so important to the smell. Is a historical fact that we have to go to the very origin of mammals in our planet , when the dinosaurs were ruling the world. We have to remember that the dinosaurs , big reptiles , not all of them , but most of them , they were like reptiles , so they needed the light of the sun to keep themselves warm. It 's nice , like the lizards , so they were all during the day.

During the night , they had to stay calm , because they had n't , they had n't , how do they say it , they were n't warm. And they all had to walk warm with a whole lot , and I do n't know what to say in English. Are the tiny mammals , okay?

So that 's why we , the tiny mammals around the planet , just to surround , through a , by night , okay? To eat some beetles or some insects around , okay?

So , because they had warm blood blood , so this , because of this warm blood , they , they were able to , to live during the night. But during the night , they were living in the caves during the whole day , and when they went out , they only had to live for insects.

So they were not looking with the eyes. They , they , they were not in the need to see beyond in the horizon. They were just looking in the night , insects.

So that 's why they needed to smell a lot. They needed to develop the , the , the smell in order to , to find the food , okay?

So that 's why all the mammals at the first stage develop the , the smell , the most , okay?

So during thousands of years , we developed so much the smell , that it became more , and intuition , than a fact.

So by intuition , you can smell , that could happen during the night.

So all the things that you do n't see , you can smell them.

So our brain evolved , so we could interpret things , even if they had n't happened yet. This had evolved in a way that , even today , we used this concept of this , this smells really good , a sense that are picking up both situations and not about things.

So what is intuition? Intuition is not a , a sixth sense. Intuition basically is the development , the great development of one of our senses.

So now remember , remember when you were this little mouse 's , this little mammal going in the night , you were so fragile that you needed to survive , so you needed to know , what are the dangers that you have outside?

So what you have to do is to pay attention to the situation , so what you have to do is to pay attention to the smell of your enemies , of the smells of the beings that can kill you , of the smell of those things that can poison you.

So now , you understand that this little mammal started to register so many , informations in order to survive.

Okay? And this is the moment when we understand that for our brain , for our anatomy is so important to discern what smells bad. Because what smells bad can , and this is what we call rank or resentment.

So what is resentment to go back to the past , to see what are all those things that can hurt me?

Someone that is resentful is someone that is constantly thinking , in the past , constantly thinking in the past.

So , to rank or , is that person that used the tools from the past of what that person felt in the past , to protect itself from the things that are coming in the future. We have two different types of resentment of rank or , one of them is the one that is evolution. The evolution one is the one that is preventive. It prevents me from all the situations that can happen that I smell can be that.

And there 's the other rank or the other resentment that says to me , everything that is coming will be like what happened to us before.

So , do n't be open to anything. This are the two types.

So what we have to do is to work with the evolution rank or , which is to acknowledge all the things that happen to us , to acknowledge all the things that happen to us , so we could , to visualize all the things that can happen in the future.

So I can take out of that and to prepare myself for that. What we have to try to solve to try and set ourselves free from is from the rank or the resentment , that keeps us constantly in the past , not allowing us to move forward to evolve.

So we have to be very careful with the smell. Usually , we have heard that women are much more resentful than men.

Today , people say this like , like , how do you say it? Say this like this , this perspective way , but what it really is , is a tool for evolution.

So in order to understand why the women are much more resentful , we have to go back again to the little rats in billions of years ago. This would be like this , male. Male , go out and they hunt , they eat , but they try to survive themselves.

Okay? Just tries to survive themselves. But the female does exactly the same at the moment when the female has babies. And babies for the female body is not at a different being.

It 's an extension of its own body.

Okay? That 's how the feminine body feels it. It 's an extension of the same body. The feminine female evolves to feel its own body away.

It 's both to smell its kids as if it is its own body. It 's the conflicts , it smells the dangers for the babies and for herself.

Okay?

So it is able to perceive and to have more intuition because it evolves with much more perception , because it 's only divides much more.

So through thousands of years , that 's why women had a lot of much more tools to evolve to much more tools to be able to live. And it 's a very effective way to perceive and to feel the other one to have more intuition. And of course , much more data , so much more render. One of the things that I want to clarify is that there 's nothing in nature that is that.

In nature , everything that has survived through thousands and billions of years is because it was you. Nothing is useful. If it is useless for nature , it just , it gets rid of it. And that 's it.

Nature does n't have this thing of , oh , but I want to keep this. No , no. If it 's not useful. Go away.

So if it arrives until , if it arrived until our , it 's because for nature might be useful. I would say , morality has sucked biology. That there 's no other way to say it. Because , because we , we with the spiritual and philosophical aspects , we would say , we need to get rid of render.

We have to get rid of sadness or ego and so many things we have to get rid of. But they are there in our body , it 's because they are useful for something.

So it 's not about how to get rid of it. It 's about how can I learn to see properly. That 's our main goal. How to use it properly.

That 's the most important thing.

So we do n't have to get rid of anything. That 's why we are talking a good about render resentment. Because we have to understand from how to use it. And so this , let 's go to the information for it.

I will use an example for my own life , for example. I would say for example , my dad , my dad recognized me when I was born.

So he said , I 'm not your father. I 'm not the father.

So go away.

So imagine that today with 33 years old , I would still be like , like , not him like with this resentment. Why did you , about me? Why did you , why you did n't recognize me , you know , for example? That 's an example of a render of resentment in that way , because it 's been a long time.

And I 'm still feeling that.

So the resentment or render used in a evolution , in the way of evolution , would be acknowledged that the vision of abandon of my dad. And now understand that I lived throughout my life , different moments of abandon from parts of my friends or of the people I felt abandon in my life. But when you see the pattern repeating , you say , oh , it 's not that people is abandon me , is that I am abandoning myself.

So when you recognize that , you start to work with , okay , I have to , in the moments when I am going to feel abandon , now I know that it 's me who should n't be abandon.

## Daily Practice Elements

So when I recognize that , I also come back to my dad and I recognize that I should not abandon him and that I should not abandon the other ones that I love , okay. But I never forget , because if I forget the concept of me being abandon , I wo n't be able to use it in a proper way in the future , in the future situations , that would be. The vibration for today is VI. The statement for today is I am the consciousness transmutation.

The code for today is the sixth dimension. The associate projected in its polarity creates the sixth dimensional point , forming an octahedral that represents the seed of the tree of life. This , this way , the sixth dimension incorporates the creative capacity , where acknowledges the potential of the seed and programs and programs it to be the best possible tree. Here is where the architects of reality express the manifesting of their words and life.

We sit comfortable , we start to move our shoulders and circles. Until I let all the weight fall down , focus in in my breathing. To get you breath and become aware of the light around me. Take a deep breath and with your eyes closed , peach around you , all the people that you know in your life.

This is one that tells you , and all the rest , away , distribute it all around in different distances. The ones that make you bad , the ones that make you good. I take a look around me , receiving all the people , being surrounded by this same light that I feel. Delight , the emerges from me.

I have served the light reflected on them , shine. And I picture each one of these people as waves , moving soft , shining in the ocean of my mind for my soul. Take a deep breath and dive within the world. Going deeper and deeper to the darkest part of the ocean to the subconscious.

I watch of all the lights , the clarity fading away , a sighted deeper and deeper in the shadows. I feel the pressure of the conscious over the unconscious and all the weight of the unconscious , pushing the subconscious and the entire subconscious , pushing all its pressure on me. I become aware that all this weight that I am feeling is due to the rangle , to the resentment that is pressing all this weight. On my shoulders.

I take him home and to perceive and feel the closest ones. What are my rangers? What are my resentment? And I manifest my intention by the desire to set myself free from rangle and resentment.

And use it properly as a tool.

So I start to violate , so I can bring my intention to transmit the resentment throughout all my consciousness in all its levels. I feel this stress it soften my life.

So. . . I say pronounce the sound , I feel my voices.

Protected in the waves of the ocean. The dark. . .

The dark. . . The dark.

. . The dark. .

. I am. . .

Consciousness. . . Transportation.

I am. . . The Transportation.

. . Of consciousness. .

. I am. . .

Consciousness. . . Transportation.

. .

So you give it bread. To your arms through the heart. Becoming nowhere. .

. Of this power. . .

I bring all these consciousness throughout my body. . . Like a reason.

. . Touching. .

. And setting myself free from all the weight of the deepest part of the ocean. I am. .

. Consciousness. . .

Consciousness. . . In short , in some time , come back here and then.

. . Open your arms. I am.

. .

Today , pay attention to your dreams. . . And.

. . Allow yourself to come to the conditions to show you your resentment and how to heal them. Thank you for being there.

And. . . As always , see you tomorrow at the same time.

Bye.
