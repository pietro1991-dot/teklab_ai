## Introduction

I have everyone and one. Good afternoon , good evening. I was just saying that I would speak like two hours today. I would speak a lot today.

I try and abuse. How to say , and verse ecology with me.

So I speak a little bit. How 's everyone?

So today is the last day I 'm here in this place.

So , I 'm going to start to change.

So let 's begin with today 's topic in the Torres day , the Torres day. The topic for today is the plan.

So talking about the plan. Let 's try to understand this topic a bit much , because we use a lot of this concept of there is a plan in the universe. And we will speak about this plan according to two point of view. One , which is the personal.

So what is a personal plan? Related to our own life , like a plan for myself. And what is the clarification of something? And what is the plan?

The plan of the cosmos , the great plan.

So let 's begin with what is for us a personal plan , something that we have to plan in our lives.

So just before we begin to remind that all the topics that we are speaking about , all the topics we are speaking about are one related to the other. They are not separated. They are not one topic and another topic and something different. All the things that we are speaking is basically the same thing spoken in different ways.

So this is like a like a Russian doll.

So one topic is inside the other and basically all of them looks the same. They want every , all of them are alike.

So that 's why when you do n't get something of this topic , so you just can go and read through the other topics. To help you understand. I just just to share that if you notice that I am tired or a little bit like out of my axis , a bit is basically because today has been a hard day. For many things today I 've been trying to pack everything to put order and all the things that I have because I have to everything back to another place.

So I 've been ranging everything here and also I took me a lot to write the blog today because it was hard even if we are talking about many things every day and the issues are alike one another. The way in which we are treating them makes you understand different ways different things of this.

So today was one of those days that was like a therapy and of course I do n't know how you are taking this path but for me it 's like being in a therapy every day. In observation every day so sometimes I 'm not in the mood of speaking or whatever or still processing the information that it was trying to work that day so. It will take a while. Yes.

I do n't know if you know everything that I that I have done since the very beginning. But today I spoke about the concept of utter tutti in the blog. If you if you did n't so I invited you to read it.

So in the blog I said about the utter tutti and. It was. It was the first name that I used to to to say. Everything to explain everything that I know.

Basically I 'm not going to tell the whole story but when I left the university. I used someone invited me to make a. Conference and she said so you said what what is the name of the conference what 's the name of what you 're going to do and immediately I received. I thought about this memory I had about the plan that we call C.

Hot in here in in Egypt in that time. And the plan was utter tutti.

So I decided to call. After tutti. Everything that I do. Because of the plan the universe of plan as we call it in that time.

So after tutti means heaven on earth. After means heaven and. The whole thing is that the whole thing is. The whole thing is that the whole thing is in.

So that the entire thing is in.

So as an earth. After tutti was the plan. In which the ancient ones used to say. We have come from the universe to the earth.

So we have to take this information from the earth towards. The universe.

So that we are doing. The earth. That means bring heaven on earth. And then bring it 's light into the heavens.

So this concept was like our religion in that time. Our philosophy of life. We. We have pitch many ways.

But that was just a point of view. Just a different way of. Same of seeing things.

Okay.

So the other tutti plan was to download all this information from the heavens and to live it here on the planet.

So we could go up again into the cosmos. And basically the philosophy of the other tutti the plan. And then the. And within the.

The concepts of the seven laws of the universe , the tree of life. And all the things that we are speaking about. But we are. But we are.

We are talking about every day. Here in this. Think that we are doing. What is this.

Well , whatever in this. What we are doing. Everything that we are doing. It 's basically philosophy of the other tutti.

So for me represented that the great plan of everything. Everything that we used to. Learn in that time was from. An architect.

Was from the point of view of an architect. This architect is the one that you know today with the name of. Of. Leben.

Thought , ah ja hu tte by the Egyptians.

So. Yeah.

So.

So. This is the main teacher.

So.

So so Ja hu was an architect. And the reason why he was an architect is because. For all the ancient cultures , the one that that. Try to understand the universe , the spider was the most important concepts to help us understand how everything was created.

So the spider was like this being that represented the whole reality. The first one that was creating the network.

So the spider was the one considered the center of the universe , the one that created everything , because she was creating this tissue in the universe.

So I do n't know if you know this concept , but there is a structure called the Tesseract , which is 8. That 's outside , shaping a cube , and another cube inside holding , being whole in the center. That 's a Tesseract. It 's a.

. . That.

So the Tesseract is a concept of a cube that represents the still reality inside , and the physically inside , but it can spread , expand , and create like a fractal once again , once again , and it 's always the same structure.

So for the ancient ones , the spider was one of the most important symbols , because with the 8 parts that it has here outside , creates the eternal structure by weaving the way. And the 8 eyes that the spider has creates the inner side , the inner aspect , the still aspect. It 's the 8 eyes of the spider can see everything beyond from the still level , and the parts represent the physical , so with the physical it waves the way.

So the ancient ones saw how a spider , what it does , is to create like a system of a network , okay? That is replicating itself once and again.

So after this lines , the spider will start to create like a pattern , depending on the species , it will create a different pattern around. And the spider , when she finished it , it positioned itself in the center. It does n't matter where something falls in the web by vibration , the spider will feel everything , all the time by perception.

So they saw how the spider was being created by polarity , by correspondence , by a pattern of mine , that it generated this vibration with a rhythm.

So suddenly , all the loss of the universe , plus the mathematics in the numbers in the geometry , everything was here. The spider has everything. They had also the 8 eyes inside and the 8 thoughts of the spider outside the test-rack.

So they call the spider as the main weaver , the main weaver.

Okay? The main weaver. From that time on , the first people , if there are people to understand everything , they were called themselves the spider man , which is funny. But the man , yeah , the spider man.

So the main weaver in Greek is Areas Sector. Areas main Sector weaver.

So both together creates the word Architect. The architect is the main weaver.

So what they understood is that the architect is the one that designs the map to build. Then the people come and starts to create.

So the spider is the one that creates this web by expanding its notes by expanding the strings.

Okay?

So this structure is something that is expanded.

So this system here must be expanded in order to exist.

So plan in the ancient languages means expansion.

So something that needs to be expanded is a plan.

So a plan is like a plane is like a plant , clarification , a planning. Yes , something that is extended , expands with many branches. That 's why a plant. And not only describe something that is expanded , but also the movement of that expansion.

So we have something that had expanded like this , like this network , but also describes the movement of this network.

So that 's why we also have the word planet to describe something that moves in a plane.

So we have n't now with our human mind , mind says , okay , if we are here and we can with our mind create a plane , a plan to do something. To create something in this world. If we as an architect mind , we can create manifest something from a clarification.

So we said , we are also a creation.

So if we are creating something , so that means that there must be something that we can create.

Someone bigger that also has this line everything.

So someone that created us by the sign. What they did was to say , if there is the spider , which is the one that is weaving and creating these clarifications , now the humans can think that information to start to create , to start to manifest in the world , to create stuff like the spiders doing maps , doing , doing clarifications to build something , to connect the visible networks and so on.

So the humans said , well , if we are also created , then this being around should be the first one on having created all this on having done this network , this web.

So that 's why it was called the great architect , the great architect. For that moment , the great network , the great web was called the great spider , the spider that created everything. It was not a person , it was the spider.

So they called it the great spider because always was a matrix.

So it was like the womb of the mother , creating everything. For a long time , people did the spider like the great architect.

So related to this concept of how the universe created by Weaver , all the priest and priestess needed to understand. Or to become architects to understand the divine. And through the architecture , they could understand how everything was built in this matrix of the body sample.

So they said , oh , we need to learn about medicine biology. I will try to understand biology. But in the end of the two that if the Weaver is creating this network with strings like the spider web , by vibration.

So they need to understand also music to play with strings and understand it. And because all this structure is spread and expanding through all the universe connecting every level , that 's why in the old languages they call this the plan. This is not related to the word God has a plan or the universe has a plan for me. When we say the universe or God has a plan , it 's not someone saying , I have to do this or that or this or that.

And this is what is going to happen with this one or whatever. But what is really saying is that the universe is an existence that starts to expand and expand , allowing everything to be , to exist.

So when we have this conflict about , but who is the being? Like , what is the being? Who is that being? That is doing that.

That is being. Do you see the answer? It 's not someone. It 's not someone ahead.

I both outside creating is the being. You understand the word , it 's not a subject , it 's a verb. Being. The being is only one.

We as humans used to say , this is my T. S. I 'm my T. S.

This person is this one , this person is that one. But it 's not like this verb. For the universe , we are one. We are being.

So we are only one being expanding itself. One expanding itself.

So when we say , we are only one being. In expansion , is the same thing as saying , we are the universe with a plan. It 's the same thing with different words. Example.

Example. We are being like a galaxy.

So we have a galaxy. And the galaxy starts to expand. Pushing the planets and suns around.

So what is the expansion of a galaxy is when the galaxy expands itself , pushing everything away.

So it sets itself free from the gravity. But what is what we have to understand about this? That it does n't matter how far you push the things away. That 's matter how far you push the things away.

You will still be the things. Because you are. We are only one. Just one thing.

So it does n't matter if you death from the things , you will still be the things.

So what is the touchment? The touchment is to expand. To let the things go. Even if I know that the things are me.

And the opposite would be to hold it because I am afraid. I 'm afraid that if I let go , I wo n't be myself anymore. But no. You will always be you.

It does n't matter what you do.

So for example , how can I know if I am not expanding or how can I know if I can expand or not? Well , we have to think about this. Am I really doing what I like? Am I really expanding what I am?

I am really sharing with others what I like , what I want to do. Am I going to the places that I want? Am I able to transform my life? Or I am inside this pressure of our life.

Like , I am not changing all the time with the things but complaining about the same things. It 's easy to know if you are not expanding yourself.

So as I said in Spanish , there are no excuses. Like , oh , I 'm not being able to expand because I have money. Do n't come with this. Excuse me.

I would say just think about what you really are not expanding , which is to share to expand yourself , to do things , to share with others.

So , when you have to think about is if you are opening yourself , because if you are not opening in your clothes to yourself , you are not accomplishing any plan. But if you expand yourself , you are accomplishing your plan. When you expand yourself is when you are doing your plan , because plan means expansion.

## Q&A

So now the question would be , how can you say that , how can you say that there is no outer plan , but there is no big plan? If we are controlled by the astrology or the things outside external situations like we are living today , that is a plan that is moving me to do something. And I 'm not controlling that. Well , yes , I would say yes , of course , that 's a plan.

A plan that you can control , but the reason why you do control it is because you are not expanding yourself.

So that 's why the things that are expanding outside are pushing you.

So this is like if you are here , not being expanded or contract like this , and here coming something aside , that starts to expand. And in this expansion moves me.

So the force , the strength of the other one , expanding itself , condition my movement. And that 's why we call it a plan , an outer plan , the universe has a plan. Yes , the only plan that the universe has is to push all the things that are not expanding.

So that 's why we are controlled by outer plans.

So it 's not only about things that expand. Also , we have expansion in other dimensions. Things in the fourth dimension , the fifth dimension , the sixth dimension are also expanding themselves.

So that 's why we have plans from the sixth dimension , a plan from the fourth dimension. We have plans everywhere , because everything is pushing us to accomplishing some plans , according to what is pushing us. But it 's pushing us by the lives from other times , other spaces , dimensions , whatever.

So the plan is expanding and I am not being able to expand myself.

So I am being controlled by the other plans.

So the only way in which I can get aside the universe of plan is if I myself become the plan itself.

So I have to expand myself to become my own plan.

So there is an explanation that I did n't do in this question myself. This days , like , why? I am so , I am feeling so fine. Why?

I am feeling so that this year , 2021 , are being the best years of my life. I can not understand it. I was like , why? Why?

If the world is so bad , why this year has been the best year of my life? And today I got it. I understood it. Because I am expanding every day with all of you.

I expand myself every day sharing my body , my soul , my mind. Everything that I have inside , I 'm expanding everything , constantly.

So , so every day is an expansion expansion and I understood that the reason why I am accomplishing my plan this year is not because I was meant to do my business year. It 's because this year I decided to expand myself. And that 's why I am accomplishing my plan. That 's it.

I think that 's it. Who knows? There are so many things that I want to say that comes to my mind right now. But I was thinking , no , we have six more months ahead.

## Daily Practice Elements

So , I wish that. Let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is like saying a B. But by rating , the statement is I am the eternal home.

Which is related to today 's topic , which is I am the only thing that there is. The cold day is helium. This is the second chemical element of the cosmos. The one with the highest atomic quantity after hydrogen.

Helium , He , comes from the Greek Sun. An element related with several planets , most of all , gaseous and gaseous ones. And with the Sun , its energy and its energy. This means the fire.

With a high capacity of generating temperatures , this element expands among the stars and our galaxy being the 24 % of the elements.

So let 's close today with the tourists.

So just to tell you that tomorrow we start with the physical aspect of Capricorn.

So we will go into the systems. I do n't know the order , I guess. But for sure , we will go and speak about politics , religion , education , economics.

So take a deep breath and absorb the fire for today.

So I 'm just saying that depending on what happens this week , we will determine if I keep going with the project or if I just quit and I go back home. This week , the 10 days that come will be the exam of Capricorn. And what I mean with this is that I know that when we speak about the universe , everything is beautiful. But when we start to speak about politics , economics and so on , the things that are here.

Usually we forget about everything that we spoke.

So take a deep breath and let 's try to see if all the things that we have been working with in six months are working on.

Okay.

So that 's why if it does n't work , I go by home. That 's it.

So 10 days of exams.

So I think it 's good that I will have this 10 days on a boat because I will flow with this information for sure. But I must say that at least I have all my things packed already.

So depending on what happened these 10 days of exam , I will. I have everything already to go back home. I do n't know. Is it comfortable?

Today when I was in the pyramid , the guide that appeared was an architect and when he said , I was thinking myself , it 's good that tomorrow I go to the boat and I will be relaxing there and suddenly this this architect told me , you know that we we 're going to be waiting for you in each step , you 'll give there.

So I was like , it 's never about relaxing. Always about doing something.

So I was like , it 's not about relaxing.

So I was like , it 's not about relaxing.

So I was like , it 's not about relaxing.

## Q&A

So I was like , it 's not about relaxing. All of them are related to the plan of my being. I asked myself , have I accomplished my plan? Am I doing my plan?

Or I do n't know how to accomplish my plan. I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan?

I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan?

I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan?

I asked myself , what is my plan? I asked myself , what is my plan? Take any breath. I see faces of all these people and I recognize that they are part of my plan.

They are part of me and I am not going to be able to accomplish my plan until I become it. Take a deep breath and stand up. There were you and what had towards the fire. And you feel that the fire does n't burn.

## Energy Work

So you stare inside the fire. And it nights you from your feet to your crown in head. It burns your body. It does n't hurt.

It burns your soul and your spirit. As you violate , rebound , seeing you become the fire. I am not going to be the fire. I am not going to be the fire.

I feel the fire expanding from myself creating this great network of tourists. And each one of these people around me becomes a stream in this world. I am the eternal home. I am the eternal home.

I am the plan. Take a deep breath and start to bring this consciousness all around your body. And each part of the body stretching all your body and warning. And each one at its own time come back here and now.

And for today we arrived down. What is our plan? How do we feel with the plan of our life? Thank you everybody for accompanying me in this.

Having accompanied me in this emotional wake of Capricorn and see you tomorrow. And the same time to begin with the physical wake. Thank you.
