## Overview

On January 20th, Matias closes the **Emotional Week** of Capricorn and prepares for the **Physical Week** ahead with a profound teaching on **The Plan**. This is both **personal** (what is a plan for your life?) and **cosmic** (what is the great plan of the universe?).

The teaching centers on **Ater Tuti** (Heaven on Earth)—the ancient Egyptian philosophy that Matias used as the foundation for all his work. This was not just a concept but **the plan of the universe**: to download information from the heavens, live it on Earth, and then bring Earth's light back into the heavens. **The cycle of descent and ascent, bringing spirit into matter and matter back to spirit.**

The **spider** is revealed as the primary symbol of the Creator—the **architect** who weaves the universal web from the center outward. The spider has **8 legs** (creating the external, physical structure through weaving) and **8 eyes** (perceiving the internal, still reality). This creates the **Tesseract**—the geometric structure of reality: a cube within a cube, the still center within the moving exterior, the eternal pattern that can expand fractally forever.

**The universe's plan is expansion**—not a fixed destination, but an eternal process of **weaving the web, creating the network, connecting all consciousness** through the toroidal field that encompasses everything. **You are part of this plan not as a follower, but as a weaver, an architect, a creator of the eternal home.**

## Core Teaching

### Two Aspects of Plan

Matias begins by clarifying that we'll speak about **the plan** according to two points of view:

**1. Personal Plan**
- What is a personal plan?
- Something related to our own life
- A plan for myself

**2. The Great Plan**
- The clarification of something
- The plan of the cosmos
- The great universal plan

**Both are connected.** All the topics in this series are **not separated**—they are **one related to the other**, like Russian dolls, one inside the other, all alike.

### Ater Tuti: The Original Philosophy

Before diving into the plan, Matias shares the **origin story** of his entire work.

When he left university, someone invited him to give a conference. She asked: **"What is the name of what you're going to do?"**

Immediately, he received a **memory from ancient Egypt**—the plan they called **"Ater Tuti."**

**Ater Tuti** became the name for **everything he does**.

#### The Meaning of Ater Tuti

**Ater** = Heaven
**Tuti** = Earth

**Ater Tuti = Heaven on Earth**

But it's not just "heaven on earth" in the sense of paradise. **It's the PLAN.**

### The Philosophy of Ater Tuti

**The ancient ones used to say:**

**"We have come from the universe to the Earth. So we have to take this information from the Earth towards the universe. We are doing the Earth."**

**This means:** Bring heaven on Earth, and then bring Earth's light into the heavens.

**Ater Tuti was the plan:**
- Download all information from the heavens
- Live it here on the planet
- Then go up again into the cosmos **carrying Earth's experience**

**The cycle:** Spirit → Matter → Spirit (enriched by material experience)

### Ater Tuti as Religion and Philosophy

**Ater Tuti was:**
- Our **religion** in that time
- Our **philosophy of life**

**We have reached it in many ways.** But that was just a **point of view**, just a different way of seeing things.

**The Ater Tuti plan included:**
- The **seven laws of the universe**
- The **Tree of Life**
- All the things we are speaking about every day in this series

**Everything we are doing in this "I Am" work is basically the philosophy of Ater Tuti.**

For Matias, this represented **the great plan of everything**.

### The Architect: Thoth/Tehuti

Everything they learned in ancient Egypt about Ater Tuti **came from an architect**.

This architect is known today by the name **Thoth** (Greek) or **Tehuti** (Egyptian pronunciation).

**Thoth/Tehuti was an architect.**

**Why an architect?**

Because **for all ancient cultures**, the one trying to understand the universe found that **the spider** was the most important concept to help us understand **how everything was created**.

### The Spider: Symbol of the Creator

**The spider was this being that represented the whole reality.**

**The spider was the first one creating the network.**

The spider was considered **the center of the universe**, the one that **created everything**, because she was **creating this tissue in the universe**.

#### The Tesseract

**Do you know the concept of the Tesseract?**

A **Tesseract** is:
- **8 points outside**, shaping a cube
- Another **cube inside**, being held in the center
- A structure that represents **still reality inside** and **physically expandable outside**

**The Tesseract:**
- Can **spread, expand, create like a fractal** once again, once again
- Is **always the same structure**
- Represents the **eternal pattern** of creation

**For the ancient ones, the spider was one of the most important symbols because:**

**With the 8 parts (legs) it has outside, it creates the eternal structure by weaving the way.**

**The 8 eyes the spider has create the inner side, the inner aspect, the still aspect.**

**Breakdown:**
- **8 legs (external/physical)** = the parts that **create the physical web**, the external structure
- **8 eyes (internal/still)** = can **see everything beyond** from the still level, perceiving the inner reality

**The ancient ones saw:**
- **The physical** (8 legs) waves the way (creates the structure)
- **The inner perception** (8 eyes) sees beyond (perceives the pattern)

### The Spider's Web: Creating the Network

**What does a spider do?**

It creates **a system of a network**.

**The spider:**
1. Sits in the **center**
2. **Weaves outward** from the center
3. Creates a **radial pattern**—lines going from center to edge
4. Creates a **spiral pattern**—lines circling around the center
5. Builds a **network/web** that connects all points

**The spider's web is:**
- **Radial** (from center outward—like spokes of a wheel)
- **Spiral** (circling around—like the golden ratio)
- **Interconnected** (every point touches every other point through the web)

**This is the structure of the universe.**

### The Spider as Architect

**Thoth/Tehuti was called "the architect"** because:

He taught the **spider's way of creation**:
1. Start from the **center** (the still point, the Self, the Source)
2. **Weave outward** (expand, create, manifest)
3. Build the **network** (connect all things)
4. Create the **eternal structure** (the Tesseract, the pattern that can repeat fractally forever)

**An architect doesn't just build—an architect PLANS.**

**The architect sees:**
- The **pattern** (the Tesseract, the eternal structure)
- The **process** (weaving from center outward)
- The **purpose** (creating the network that connects all consciousness)

**This is the Great Plan.**

### The Personal Plan and the Universal Plan

**Now we can understand both:**

**1. The Universal Plan (Ater Tuti)**
- Bring heaven to Earth (spirit into matter)
- Live it, experience it, embody it
- Bring Earth to heaven (matter enriched with experience back to spirit)
- **This is the eternal cycle of expansion**
- The spider weaving the web from the center outward, forever

**2. The Personal Plan**
- Your individual expression of the universal plan
- Your unique way of **weaving your part of the web**
- Your path from **spirit to matter to spirit**
- Your contribution to the **network/web** of consciousness

**Your personal plan IS the universal plan**, expressed through your unique perspective and creative contribution.

### Expansion: The Core of the Plan

**What is the plan of the universe?**

**Expansion.**

**Not a destination. Not a final goal. Not a finish line.**

**The plan is the eternal process of EXPANSION:**
- Weaving more of the web
- Connecting more consciousness
- Creating more network
- Experiencing more of itself
- Knowing itself more fully

**The spider never stops weaving.** The web is **never finished**. 

**This is why the Toroid is the eternal chakra**—because the plan is **eternal expansion**, not temporary achievement.

### The Toroid: The Eternal Home

**The Toroid Chakra** is the **complete energetic field**, the full electromagnetic structure around the body and consciousness.

**The Toroid is:**
- The **field** that encompasses everything
- The **pattern** of energy flow (in through the top, down through the center, out through the bottom, back up around the outside, in through the top again—eternal circulation)
- The **home** where all the chakras, all the energy, all the consciousness exists

**The Toroid is shaped like:**
- A donut
- An apple
- The electromagnetic field around the heart
- The field around the Earth
- The structure of the universe

**It's the spider's web in 3D**—the network that connects all things through eternal circulation.

### "I Am the Eternal Home"

**This statement reveals:**

**You are not just IN the eternal home. You ARE the eternal home.**

**You are:**
- The **Toroid** (the complete field)
- The **Web** (the network connecting all consciousness)
- The **Tesseract** (the eternal structure, still center with expanding exterior)
- The **Spider** (the creator weaving from the center outward)
- The **Plan** (Ater Tuti—the cycle of bringing heaven to earth and earth to heaven)

**You are the eternal home where:**
- Spirit descends into matter
- Matter rises enriched back to spirit
- The web is woven
- The network expands
- The plan unfolds

**You are not FOLLOWING the plan. You ARE the plan.**

### All Topics Connect as One

Matias reminds us throughout this teaching:

**All the topics we are speaking about are one related to the other. They are not separated.**

Looking back at the Emotional Week of Capricorn:
- **Day 161: Reason** - The three levels of consciousness creating different perspectives
- **Day 162: Projects** - Throwing ahead what we've experienced from the past
- **Day 163: Aid** - Supporting those who are learning, creating freedom
- **Day 164: Relations** - Expanding ourselves through connection with others
- **Day 165: Family** - The group that shares and exchanges
- **Day 166: Frustration** - The fraud of expectations not matching reality
- **Day 167: Work** - The manifestation of soul and body in the material world
- **Day 168: Adversities** - The bending of the universe to see itself from different angles
- **Day 169: Beliefs** - What is recorded in the heart through emotion
- **Day 170: Plan** - The eternal expansion, the weaving of the web, Ater Tuti

**They're all the same thing spoken in different ways.**

**Like Russian dolls:** one topic inside the other, all alike, all connected.

**They all describe:** The universe's process of **expanding, connecting, experiencing, and knowing itself**—and you are part of that process, **weaving your part of the eternal web**.

### The Seven Laws and the Tree of Life

Matias mentions that **the Ater Tuti plan** included:
- **The seven laws of the universe** (which we explored in the Mental Week: Mentalism, Correspondence, Vibration, Rhythm, Cause/Effect, Polarity, Generation)
- **The Tree of Life** (the structure of consciousness and creation)

**All of this is the same plan:**
- The **laws** describe **how the web is woven** (the principles of creation)
- The **Tree** describes **the structure of the web** (the pattern of consciousness)
- **Ater Tuti** describes **the purpose of the web** (bringing heaven to earth and earth to heaven)
- **The Spider** describes **the creator of the web** (the architect weaving from the center)

**It's all one teaching, one plan, one eternal expansion.**

### From Emotional to Physical Week

Today closes the **Emotional Week** and tomorrow begins the **Physical Week**.

**This is perfect timing for the Plan teaching:**

**The Emotional Week** taught us how **emotions record beliefs in our hearts** (Day 169) and how we **relate, work, navigate adversity** (Days 164-168).

**The Physical Week** will teach us how to **manifest, embody, ground** these understandings into **material reality**.

**The Plan bridges both:**
- **Ater Tuti** is about bringing **heaven** (consciousness, emotion, spirit) **to Earth** (matter, physical, body)
- Then bringing **Earth** (enriched by physical experience) **to heaven** (consciousness expanded by material learning)

**The plan is the eternal dance between emotion and physical, spirit and matter, heaven and earth.**

### Every Day is Like Therapy

Matias shares personally:

**"I don't know how you are taking this path, but for me it's like being in therapy every day."**

**"In observation every day. So sometimes I'm not in the mood of speaking or whatever, or still processing the information I was trying to work that day."**

**This is honest and real:** The plan is not always easy. The weaving is not always smooth. But **the process continues**, because **expansion is eternal**.

Even the teacher, the architect, the spider **is still weaving, still processing, still learning**.

**That's the beauty of the eternal plan—it never ends. There's always more to weave, more to expand, more to discover.**

## Practice

### Becoming the Architect: Weaving Your Web

**Setup:** Sit or stand comfortably, close your eyes, take deep breaths.

**Part 1: Find Your Center (The Spider's Position)**

1. **Bring all your awareness to your center**—your core, your heart, your still point.

2. **This is where the spider sits:** In the center of the web, still and aware.

3. **Feel your Toroid Chakra** surrounding you—the complete energetic field that encompasses your whole being.

4. **Recognize:** You are the **architect**, the **spider**, the **creator** of your web.

**Part 2: See the 8 Eyes (Inner Perception)**

5. **Imagine 8 eyes opening** within your consciousness—the ability to **see beyond**, to perceive the **inner reality**, the **still aspect** of existence.

6. **These 8 eyes represent:**
   - Crown, Third Eye, Throat, Heart (upper 4)
   - Plexus, Sacral, Root, Knees (middle-lower 4)
   - All seeing inward toward the **still center**, the **eternal pattern**

7. **From this inner vision, perceive the Plan:** Ater Tuti—bringing heaven to earth, earth to heaven.

**Part 3: Feel the 8 Legs (Outer Creation)**

8. **Now feel 8 legs extending from your center**—the ability to **weave**, to **create**, to **build the web** in the physical world.

9. **These 8 legs represent:**
   - Your actions in the 8 directions
   - Your manifestation in the physical realm
   - Your weaving of the network

10. **From the center outward, begin to weave:**
    - Imagine each leg spinning a thread
    - The threads create **radial lines** (from center to edge—like spokes)
    - The threads create **spiral lines** (circling around—like the golden ratio)
    - The web **expands** from your center, connecting to all things

**Part 4: The Tesseract (Still Center, Moving Exterior)**

11. **See the Tesseract forming:**
    - **Cube inside** (the 8 eyes, the still center, the eternal pattern)
    - **Cube outside** (the 8 legs, the expanding web, the physical manifestation)
    - **Connected** by your consciousness, your energy, your being

12. **Recognize:** You are **both** the still center and the expanding exterior. **Both** the eternal pattern and the ever-growing web.

**Part 5: Ater Tuti (The Eternal Cycle)**

13. **Feel the descent:**
    - Heaven (spirit, consciousness, ideas) **descending** into your crown
    - Moving **down** through your chakras
    - **Grounding** into Earth (matter, physical, manifestation) through your root

14. **Feel the ascent:**
    - Earth (experience, embodiment, lessons) **rising** from your root
    - Moving **up** through your chakras
    - **Returning** to Heaven (spirit enriched by material experience) through your crown

15. **Feel the Toroidal flow:**
    - In through the top, down through the center, out through the bottom
    - Around the outside, back up, in through the top again
    - **Eternal circulation**, eternal expansion, eternal plan

**Part 6: Affirm Your Eternal Home**

16. **"I Am the Eternal Home"** (repeat three times)
    - You are the **Toroid**, the complete field
    - You are the **Web**, the network connecting all consciousness
    - You are the **Plan**, the eternal expansion
    - You are the **Spider**, the architect weaving from the center
    - You are the **Home** where heaven and earth meet

**Part 7: Personal Plan Revelation**

17. **Ask from your center:** "What is my personal plan?"

18. **Don't think the answer—FEEL it, SEE it with your 8 inner eyes:**
    - What part of the web are you here to weave?
    - What unique thread do you add to the network?
    - How does your personal plan express the universal plan?

19. **Know:** Your personal plan IS the universal plan, expressed through your unique creative contribution.

**Closing:**

20. **Breathe deeply** and slowly open your eyes.

21. **Look around at the world** and see the **web**—the network of consciousness connecting all beings, all things.

22. **Know that you are weaving this web** every day, with every action, every thought, every emotion, every choice.

23. **Stand and stretch** your 8 metaphorical legs—your ability to create, manifest, and weave in all directions.

24. **Take one step forward**, knowing you are **walking the plan**, weaving the eternal web, bringing heaven to earth and earth to heaven with every step.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Throughout the day, practice being the architect:**

1. **Find your center** (like the spider in the middle of the web)
   - Take a moment to breathe and return to your still point
   - From here, perceive with your 8 inner eyes
   - From here, create with your 8 outer legs

2. **See the web** around you:
   - Every person is a point on the web
   - Every connection is a thread you're weaving
   - The network expands as you interact consciously

3. **Ask with each action:** "How does this weave the web?"
   - Does this action **connect** or **separate**?
   - Does this choice **expand the network** or **contract** it?
   - Am I weaving **from the center outward** or randomly?

4. **Practice Ater Tuti:**
   - **Descend:** Bring consciousness (heaven) into your actions (earth)
   - **Ascend:** Bring experience (earth) back to awareness (heaven)
   - **Circulate:** Feel the toroidal flow—in, down, out, around, up, in again

5. **Remember your eternal home:**
   - You are the **Toroid**, the complete field
   - You are the **Web**, the network
   - You are the **Plan**, the eternal expansion

### Applying This Teaching

- **See yourself as the architect** of your life, not just a follower of someone else's plan
- **Weave from the center outward**—start with your still point (meditation, awareness, being) and expand from there
- **Connect consciously**—every interaction is a thread in the web; weave with intention
- **Embrace the eternal process**—the plan is never finished; expansion is eternal; the web is always growing
- **Bring heaven to earth** in everything you do—manifest consciousness into matter
- **Bring earth to heaven** in everything you experience—transform material experience into spiritual wisdom

### Entering the Physical Week

Tomorrow begins the **Physical Week** of Capricorn with the topic of **Religion**.

**The Plan teaching prepares us:**

**Ater Tuti** is about **bringing heaven to Earth**—which is exactly what the Physical Week addresses: **how to manifest consciousness in matter**, how to **ground spirit into body**, how to **live the plan physically**.

**You now know:**
- The **pattern** (Tesseract—still center, expanding exterior)
- The **process** (weaving from center outward)
- The **purpose** (eternal expansion, creating the network)
- The **cycle** (Ater Tuti—descent and ascent, heaven to earth to heaven)

**Now you will learn how to EMBODY this**, how to walk it, how to make it physical.

**The Emotional Week taught you what to feel and believe.**

**The Physical Week will teach you how to manifest and live it.**

**The eternal plan continues.**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What is Ater Tuti and why is it called "the plan"?

**Ater Tuti** means "Heaven on Earth"—the ancient Egyptian philosophy that became Matias's foundation for all his work. **The plan** is: bring heaven (consciousness, spirit, information) **down to Earth** (matter, physical, manifestation), **live it and experience it here**, then bring Earth's **enriched experience** back **up to heaven** (consciousness expanded by material learning). **This cycle of descent and ascent, spirit-matter-spirit, is the eternal plan of the universe.** It's not a destination but a **continuous process of expansion and integration**.

### Q: Why is the spider the primary symbol of the Creator/Architect?

Because **the spider creates the web**—the network that connects all things. The spider has **8 legs** (creating the external, physical structure through weaving) and **8 eyes** (perceiving the internal, still reality). This creates the **Tesseract**: the geometric pattern of a **cube within a cube**, still center with expanding exterior, the eternal structure that can **repeat fractally forever**. **The spider sits in the center and weaves outward**, creating radial and spiral patterns that connect all points—exactly how the universe creates and expands.

### Q: What is the Tesseract and how does it relate to the plan?

The **Tesseract** is a **4-dimensional cube**: 8 points outside forming a cube, another cube inside held in the center. It represents **still reality inside** (the eternal pattern, the 8 eyes, the unchanging truth) and **physically expandable outside** (the moving creation, the 8 legs, the growing web). **The Tesseract is the structure of the plan**—the pattern that can **expand fractally forever** while maintaining the same core structure. It's **both unchanging and eternally growing**—stillness and expansion simultaneously.

### Q: What does "I Am the Eternal Home" mean?

You are not just **in** the eternal home—**you ARE the eternal home**. You are the **Toroid** (the complete energetic field), the **Web** (the network connecting all consciousness), the **Tesseract** (the eternal structure), the **Spider** (the architect weaving from the center), and the **Plan** (the eternal expansion, Ater Tuti). **You are the space where heaven and earth meet**, where spirit descends into matter and matter rises back to spirit. **You are both the journey and the destination, the weaver and the web, the plan and its fulfillment.**

### Q: How does the personal plan relate to the universal plan?

**Your personal plan IS the universal plan**, expressed through your unique perspective and creative contribution. **The universal plan is expansion**—weaving the web, connecting consciousness, bringing heaven to earth and earth to heaven. **Your personal plan is your unique way of weaving your part of that web**—your specific thread, your particular pattern, your individual expression of the eternal process. **You are not following someone else's plan; you ARE the plan manifesting through your life.**

### Q: Why is the Toroid the "eternal" chakra?

Because **the Toroid represents the complete energetic field**—the whole structure that encompasses all other chakras. Its shape (like a donut or apple) creates **eternal circulation**: energy flows in through the top, down through the center, out through the bottom, around the outside, back up, and in through the top again—**forever**. **The plan is eternal expansion, not temporary achievement**, and the Toroid holds this eternal process. **It's never finished, always circulating, always expanding**—just like the universe's plan.

### Q: What are the 8 legs and 8 eyes of the spider, specifically?

**8 Eyes (Internal/Still Perception):**
- Crown, Third Eye, Throat, Heart (upper consciousness)
- Plexus, Sacral, Root, Knees (embodied consciousness)
- These **see inward** to the **eternal pattern**, the still reality, the unchanging truth

**8 Legs (External/Moving Creation):**
- Your **8 directions of action** in the physical world
- Your manifestation, your weaving, your contribution to the web
- These **create outward**, building the **network**, expanding the structure

**Together:** Inner perception guides outer creation. **You see the pattern with your 8 eyes, then weave it with your 8 legs.**

### Q: How do I "weave from the center outward"?

1. **Find your center**—your still point, your awareness, your being (meditation, presence)
2. **See with your 8 inner eyes**—perceive the pattern, understand the plan, know the truth
3. **Create with your 8 outer legs**—take action, make choices, interact with the world
4. **Always return to center** between actions—don't lose your still point
5. **Weave radially** (straight out from center in all directions) and **spirally** (circling around, following the golden ratio)
6. **Connect everything**—each thread you spin creates more network, more web
7. **Never stop**—expansion is eternal; the weaving continues forever

**The spider doesn't weave from the edges inward or randomly. It sits in the center and spins outward, creating the web from a place of stillness and awareness.**
