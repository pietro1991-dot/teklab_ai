## Overview

Today we arrive at the root chakra of the Physical Week of Pisces, with only three days left to finish the month. We are in Luxor, Egypt, the solar plexus of the Nile, after visiting the Temple of Edfu (the Temple of Horus).

The topic for today is **forgiveness**.

We have gone through eight months of the process of the spirit and the soul of the 12 zodiac signs. We are finishing in three days with the concepts of the soul and the spirit. This means we now begin the four months of manifestation of the body.

Today, connected to the root chakra, forgiveness is about giving away all the things we have been going through these past eight months, so we can manifest something new in these new four months.

## Why We End with the Physical

### Not Ascending—Descending

The reason why we didn't begin by the physical and end in the spiritual (like in typical ascension processes) is because our goal with this path is not to go to the heavens.

Our goal is to **bring that heaven here to Earth**, to manifest those realities that are in the subtle planes here in this matter.

That's why we end with these four months of physical manifestation of this will of the 12 signs.

## The Etymology of Forgiveness

### For-Giving vs. Receiving

The word **forgiveness** comes from:
- **For** = to, toward
- **Give** = to give

The concept of forgiveness is the ability to **give something for** or **something to**.

This is kind of the opposite of **receiving**.

**Receiving** comes from the Latin concept **"recipere"** that means **to capture**. The word capture is the same origin of receiving.

So:
- **Receiving** = to take again, to capture things again, once again for myself
- **For-giving** = to leave the things away, to let the things go

---

## The Cultural Understanding of Forgiveness

### The Christian Concept

In our cultures today, to forgive is related culturally with a Christian concept, mainly a religious way.

When we ask for forgiveness, we kind of ask for the freedom of the guilty, of the blame, the judgment that another person has put on us because of our mistakes.

So we did something wrong, and we kind of ask the other one to set us free from that mistake by asking for forgiveness.

The ones that say "I forgive you"—they are like setting the other person free from that weight. It's like someone saying: "I set you free. I don't care about what you did."

### But It's Not Exactly Like That

As always, we are here to raise patterns, so it's not exactly that.

When we go to the etymology of the word forgiveness, we can see that **we are not setting the other one free**.

The etymology of the word is saying that **I am giving something from me**—something that I had within, in my own.

---

## Forgiveness: Giving Away What's Within

### Not Setting Others Free

Forgiveness is something that you have within that you are giving away.

So it's not that you're setting someone free from the mistake. It's basically that **you are giving away your perception of the mistake of the other**.

It's clearly related to what I feel according to the mistake of the other.

---

## Everything You Feel Is Within You

### Emotions Are Ours

We have been speaking about this for a long time: understand that everything that you feel, that you think, that you receive in your body, in your soul, in your spirit is not part of the other one. **It is only within you**.

When you feel:
- Hunger
- Rage
- Happiness
- Love

All those emotions are inside of you, are not in the other person.

### Love and Hate Are Within

When you love someone, you're not loving the other person. **You are feeling that love within you**. This means that you had that love, not the other one.

When you hate someone, is not because the other person represents the hate. **It's because you have that hate inside**. That's why you can feel it.

---

## We Blame Others for What We Feel

### Taking Responsibility Away

When we feel emotions, we are attached to the concepts, the ideas of these emotions. We live through those emotions in our life and we blame others.

We say that the others are guilty for what we feel. But actually it was never like this because **everything that we have inside is only ours**. What we feel is ours.

### The Struggle

The reason why we usually struggle with this is because we blame others for what we feel. We kind of say that whatever happens to us is because of the others.

So we take all our responsibility away and we don't take awareness of the reality that we have that emotion inside of us. It's not the other one that had it.

---

## Becoming Aware to Transform

### Realizing the Source

When we become aware about we being the source of that emotion and energy, we start to realize that we have to let go of that energy in order to be able to transform, to transcend that emotion that stops us and doesn't allow us to move forward.

So I start to look for freedom.

### How Do I Set Myself Free?

By giving away the things that stuck me and don't allow me to move forward.

So by **for-giving**—to give to the world what is here inside of me—I have to give to the world those energies that are stuck within my system.

---

## Forgiveness Is About You, Not the Other

### Setting Yourself Free

As you see in this explanation, the action of forgiving is not to set the other one free.

**It's actually to set myself free from my own perception of the other one.**

I release the tension of this energy that I have inside.

### Forgiveness vs. Apology

There's a difference between forgiveness and apology:

**Apology** (from "apo-logia"):
- Means to go beyond the topic
- You're trying to set free from a conflict
- "I'm sorry" comes from the word "sorrow" (feeling sad)

**Forgiveness**:
- Is not the same as apology
- Apology is trying to set you free from something outside
- Forgiveness comes from within
- It's something that you take out, the weight that you have within
- You're not setting free someone from the outside
- You're setting yourself free from your own perception

---

## Forgiveness Is Not About Feeling Superior

### The Gift of Forgiveness

When we think about forgiveness, we have to remember that **the gift of forgiveness is not something that makes you feel superior** because you have the right consciousness of forgiving someone and setting free the other ones from their mistakes.

### It's About Your Own Liberation

Whenever you are ready to say "I forgive you" or "forgive me," remember that when you are doing that, **it's all about yourself**.

It's about taking out all the weight that you're carrying from the perception of the other person.

When you do that to your own, you are setting free the other one from that mirror, from that perception.

---

## Forgiveness Transforms You

### For Your Own Transformation

The concept of working with forgiveness is not that you are doing this for the other.

Forgiveness is to let you know that **you are setting free yourself** in order to move forward, to transform yourself into the next stage.

We are forgiving ourselves from those things that we have within.

### Speaking Out Loud

The best way to transform, to give this forgiveness, is by **speaking, by speaking out loud** the truth.

Why am I feeling like this? Why do I have to say this? To show my position in the things? Not to shut up. To share the energy that I have inside, to speak it out loud.

Once I say the things that I have to give in order to forgive, if the other one doesn't know how to handle that energy, that is what that person needs to forgive to himself or to itself. **It's not our problem anymore.**

---

## The Electrical Circuit Metaphor

### Positive and Negative

Imagine an electrical field, positive and negative:
- The **negative** is receiving—you receive energy
- The **positive** is giving—you give energy to the world

Like in a torus, you receive energy constantly from others and you give energy to the world. That's how you get light—the positive and negative currents, you get light on the lamp.

### When There's a Mistake

This is a constant movement. But what happens if that energy that you receive has a problem, has a mistake?

If you don't give it away, you will have that mistake inside and it won't help you to make light.

**When you receive the energy with a mistake, you have to forgive it** in order to keep the circuit with light. Otherwise you have a short circuit—the lights go away.

### Protecting Our Own System

What happens to us in this concept is that if we don't forgive the energy, if we don't give it away, that energy, we have the problem now in our own.

We're going to fuse, to take back the energy and use it to make it work. We don't have the problem in our house.

**That's why when we forgive, it's not about setting free the others. It's about protecting our own system in our own body.**

Maybe this is a bit selfish way to understand forgiveness, but it's much more objective than the Catholic version.

---

## There Are No Others

### We Are One System

Remember that we have this perception that we have to forgive the mistakes of others. But when we think that we have to forgive the mistakes of others, we have to remember that **there are no others in the universe**.

The universe is the whole system, a constant system of energy, where the others are the transformers of energy. But the energy is always the same, flowing around everybody.

### The Same Energy

If the other makes a mistake, it's done with the same energy that we are sharing.

This is why it's much more useful to understand forgiveness as a circuit of energy, so we know how to use it and why we need to forgive in our daily life.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortable. Close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing. Breathe deeply.

Take a deep breath and start to massage your body from your feet to your head, becoming aware of each part of it.

Feet, legs, genitals, hips, back, chest, hands, arms and shoulders, neck, face and head.

### Releasing Tension

Take a deep breath, holding the tension with strength in all the body. And let it go, releasing.

Take a deep breath and take your attention to the **coldest parts of your body right now**. Where you feel cold.

It can be just a tiny part of your body or many big parts at the same time.

### Finding the Stuck Energy

I become aware that these parts of cold are the places of the energetic circuit, mistakes, folds in my energetical field.

It's in this part of the body where I can find the stuck energy—the one that doesn't move, related to the mistakes and the rank or rage that I feel with the world and with others.

### Seeing What You Can't Forgive

I open myself to perceive what are those things, those people that I wasn't able to forgive yet.

I try to feel and see the faces, the situations, of those things that I cannot forgive yet. I bring all to me.

I observe and recognize that all those things live only within me. And they are hurting only my own system.

### Recognizing They Don't Have the Conflict

I recognize that all these facts, these situations, these faces, don't have the conflict. **It's only me who is stuck in this energy.**

If it is my will to move forward in evolution, I must recognize now that it's my decision to stare and watch into the faces of these beings and say "forgive me."

And I say this to each one of them.

### For-Giving

**I accept. And in peace. In account. This isn't my weight anymore.**

The fruit of forgiveness is freedom.

### Sounding the Vibration

Breathe. And through these greetings with my resonance, vibration, I set free, flourishing the freedom in me by forgiving all the people that are connected to me.

**To. To. To.**

**I am the manifested universe. I am the manifested universe.**

### Integration

I see everything in my mind. The universe is the territory. Everything I need is competing for light. No need for each one of them chasing me.

### Closing

Take your breath and start to bring all the consciousness through your body, stretching and warming.

Each one at some time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, identify one person or situation you haven't forgiven.

Feel where that stuck energy sits in your body. Where is it cold? Where is there tension?

Recognize: "This energy is mine. This perception is mine. The other person doesn't carry this—I do."

### Speak Your Truth

If appropriate, speak your truth about the situation. Not to blame, but to release the energy that's stuck within you.

Say what you need to say, then let it go. For-give it to the world.

### The Circuit Check

Throughout the day, notice when you're "receiving" energy with a "mistake" (someone's anger, judgment, negativity).

Ask yourself: "Am I holding onto this? Do I need to forgive (give it away) to keep my circuit flowing?"

---

## Week Context

We are in the **Physical Week of Pisces**, grounding the lessons of unity and connection into the body.

Tomorrow is the last day of Pisces. We're preparing to enter Aries—the month of action and manifestation.

Forgiveness is how we **let go of the past eight months** so we can begin the next four months fresh, unburdened, ready to manifest.

The root chakra (today's focus) is about survival, grounding, and our relationship to the physical world. Forgiveness at the root level means: "I release the survival patterns that make me hold onto pain."

## Q&A

### Q: If I forgive someone, does that mean I have to stay in relationship with them?

No. Forgiveness is about releasing the stuck energy within you. You can forgive someone and still choose to have boundaries, distance, or no contact. Forgiving doesn't mean enabling.

### Q: How is this different from spiritual bypassing?

This teaching isn't saying "just let it go" without processing. It's saying the emotion is yours to process. The other person doesn't carry your rage—you do. So you need to feel it, speak it, and then release it. That's integration, not bypassing.

### Q: What if the other person never apologizes?

Their apology is not required for your forgiveness. Forgiveness is about you releasing the weight within. Whether they acknowledge their behavior is separate from your liberation.

### Q: How do I forgive myself?

Same process. Identify where you're holding self-judgment, shame, or guilt. Recognize it's stuck energy. Speak your truth (maybe in a journal or out loud). Then for-give—give it away. Let it move through and out.

### Q: Why does Matias say this is "selfish"?

Because it reframes forgiveness from "I'm being noble by setting you free" to "I'm taking care of my own energy system." It's self-care, not martyrdom. And that's actually more honest and sustainable.

### Q: Can I forgive without confronting the person?

Yes. You can speak your truth to yourself, in a letter you don't send, in ceremony, in meditation. The other person doesn't need to hear it for you to release it.

### Q: What does "there are no others" mean practically?

We're all part of one energy field. When someone harms you, they're using the same universal energy you have access to. The "mistake" in the energy needs to be released so it doesn't keep circulating. Your forgiveness is part of healing the whole system, not just yourself.
