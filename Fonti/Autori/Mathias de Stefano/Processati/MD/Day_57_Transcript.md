## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good evening , good night.

## Energy Work

So today we have to talk about the root chara and in the physical aspect so that would be the genitals.

So today I wrote in the blog a little bit more about the concept of the process but focusing a little bit more in the aspect of the trauma.

So the issue we are discussing today is basically the trauma.

So trauma comes from the Greek word trauma , trauma , that means wound. We all had lived in our life some trauma and we had some wounds from the mental aspect , the emotional aspect and the physical aspect.

So we all have these wounds in our history and they are very important because they need us what we are.

So yesterday we spoke about the whole process that we go through but today in the blog I described the beginning of this process which is being crewed by the teeth and the one which is to the part of the increment.

So remember that yesterday I spoke that life is like the process of digestion but the first thing is the first part of this is when you go to the mouth and when you are crewed by the teeth.

So that 's the part when your self is being molded by the genetics , by your family , by the most closest ones that shape your body. We all know that mostly by nature we are supposed to be born through the vagina and the vagina has these two lips through where the baby is being born.

So if we take the digestive system as the path of life so we would have these two other lips in the mouth through where the holy meal will come inside and become an individual.

So the first thing that we do is to bite the foot , the aspect of the whole to take a tiny part that we will call an individual. Of course that the first thing that we are going to leave when we begin the process of life would be the lips of the mother and then the tongue of the father.

So by the shape of the two organs you will picture also the genitals , the other organs.

So in the same the mouth will represent the feminine aspect through where life is beginning to the process and the masculine aspect will be the tongue with the phillip shape. The individual will be separated from the whole by the bite.

So this will represent that is the beginning of my personality who I am and individual from the other one.

So this is why the first teeth are the ones that you usually show when you smile , when you are angry , these are the ones that shows the others who you are.

So once I have divided myself as an individual with personality between my mother and my father in the mouth , I start the process of being two by my ancestors , grandmothers , grandfathers and all the rest , the biology tree of life. That will cut myself in pieces.

So the process would be kind of like this. Once you start the process that once you are being created , so you are just one cell.

So now this cell must be divided into many.

## Practice Structure

So it creates the organs , it creates the muscles , the bones , the structure of the body until you have created the body.

So the body is just the division of all these parts. And each part of this is the history of your own ancestors of your tree of life.

So each one of the ancestors has something to give to.

So each organ , each part of the body will have a attribute of those ancestors.

So if we relate that with the separation of the being , we can recognize that every tooth is an ancestor that is going to shape and divide my self , my being.

So it could be created as a body in the separation.

So this means that when you are being born or created life , each one of the different aspects will be divided.

So you could experience your whole , your potential.

## Q&A

So the question would be why a spirit would want to be divided.

So the thing is this , the spirit is a thing that has a whole information , but it can not see the details of that information.

So the only way in which it can feature and understand and work with each one of the process of the aspects is by divided it. This is why as we said yesterday , you need to digest an information when you do n't get it , when you do n't understand , you need to digest it by separating the different parts and understand the different parts.

So the process of life is basically the spirit trying to understand what it has within to experience its own potential.

So basically the teeth , what they are going to do is to separate and divide each one of the aspects of the self.

So then in the path of love could be better.

So we could experience it each one of them by separate.

So we have to recognize that what we used to call the process of chewing , so the teeth divided in the food is what we in our lives call meiosis and metals , which is the process through which the cells starts to be divided.

Okay , so they create different organs , muscles and at the end our whole body.

So what we are , we are a divided aspect from the whole and express in different aspects.

So we could experience each one of our potentials. But as I said before , what I have to understand in order to accomplish this process is that we need the pressure of our biology , okay , by metals and meiosis.

So basically we have a picture to understand about this is that the genetic codes are like the pressure that our being is receiving from the tree of life from each one of our ancestors in order to divide us and to form yourself to be who we are now.

So for many people , we could say that this is why even before we are supposed to be born , we can call this process a trauma because it 's very traumatizing to the essence into many parts. It 's like a wound.

So basically when we start to leave , we are not only receiving the pressure of our ancestors and by genetics , but we also receive the pressure of the family , the partners , friends , culture , school , work , everything , the whole world. And all that world is in the team.

So when we bite , it 's a way in which our body makes us remember where our trauma.

So let 's picture this in our life. Even if we are in a very traumatic process and something that it 's hurting or also in. And also in the ecstasy process , we would relate this with our teeth.

So one of the things that we used to do when we get mad from very long time ago , billions of years is this. Basically , the reason we do this , like with the teeth when we get mad , is because billions of years ago , when we were only animals , with the teeth to attack the animals that we 're trying to attack us.

So we have in our body , or biology , that the , the reminders that when we have to , when we show our teeth this is because we are trying to protect ourselves. And we are trying to stay into the other one , acre.

So the teeth are the tool that we use to show us humans. Be aware , I will attack you , stop , or you can come. Everything is good. What we do is that when we put this face of a , be careful , I will attack.

But when we smile , it 's because I 'm showing that you can come.

So the teeth are showing us in our life , the way in which we are reacting through thousands of years of pressure and trauma.

So , and also our comforts.

So one of the things that I have to pay attention to is if I , if I , I do n't like to show my teeth , if I chew very hard , if I chew when I sleep , what happened to teeth? How do I use them? What 's , what are the problems that I have in them?

So when I bite a lot , when I make a lot of pressure with my teeth is because in my subconscious , I have a trauma that is not healed yet.

So , you are trying to protect yourself , like from that.

So basically to try to understand your teeth and the problems that you have in your teeth will help you to understand the trauma that you live in your life.

So remember that trauma comes from the word wound.

So the trauma are those pressures that our environment has downed to us to separate our parts. And it 's all this pressure that we receive to shape what we are.

So one of the things that we have to recognize is that this is a natural process , it 's normal. And we should n't wait for the universe to just make disappear the suffering of the world. Because the universe does n't understand the suffering of the world. And I 'm going to explain why now.

So first of all , we have to understand that suffering is not a system , suffering is a choice. And it is a choice because it 's our actions that takes us to the suffering. It 's not the universe creating a system of evil.

So this means that we are the ones , the only ones able to transform the system of suffering into a system of pressure. There is no need to suffer. It 's an election. It 's a choice.

And the suffering is something that happens because the cycle is repeating once and again , something is working once and again. And to understand why this system is constantly repeating , we have to go to the other extreme of the system , which is the place where the poo is created. The extreme. In the other extreme , we have the extreme , which I do n't know the words for English.

Well , of course , that you may say poo , sheet , and those words. But in Spanish , the Latin languages , it says aka that comes from the word makes in Greek. And it means bad , something that is bad.

Something , yeah , something that is bad. And also in the Latin words , cheat is nerd , nerd , which is the origin from the all-slag language , which is stirred , that means smell , that smells bad.

So this represents everything that was bad , okay , everything that we did n't use.

So to ban the bad things , the bad things of the body are the ones that we have to excreted.

So take away from the body.

So there 's a lot of people that in the process of life , through the digestive system of life , they were not able to express their truth , their reality , their inner power.

So they start again , the same process , they repeat the cycle. Basically , this means that the food , the sheet , is going to the plant , and the plant creates the flower again , and then the fruit , and the fruit is eaten again , and the cycle starts all over. In this process , we used to call to name groups of people like good people or bad people , and that bad people , we used to call it the shift people. Here we come in the question , and this is why I was explaining this before , that why we as a person , as a child , as a kid , has to leave so many trusts.

If you said that we are the responsible of what we have created , the choices , hours of the suffering , I may say , but why the children has to leave this , and why the children are leaving this. But this question is very short , because you are just thinking that life is from the moment you are born till the moment you die. And I guess that we all here know that this is not like this , that life keeps going. Life is a lot.

Big.

So remember that when we asked ourselves why I had to leave that , remember that you were once the compose , because you did all the process , and then you came back as food.

So this is the process constantly , never ending.

So the process would be that the only way in which you can get outside this cycle , constant cycle , is when you , in the process of digestion , you realize yourself that you can transcend the trauma and use the trauma as a tool to build yourself. Is the moment when you recognize that everything that you have lived , every trauma that you have lived has a meaning , because it helps you to be what you are.

So you change the whole system. We used to think that the bad things that happened to us in our life is because there are bad people or shift people in life. Why these people are like this , because they are in the process of the intestine , and they do n't accept their inner power. The moment where I set myself free from this is when I realized that all those bad people that I had in my life , they gave me the compose to tourism the plural , to flower and to create my fruits.

So if I am not able to transcend that and to understand that I have to become a flower to create my own fruits , I will also become poo. This is why the task of today is to think about and to write down each one of the trauma of our life , the bigger ones , and try to understand them as the company to create our own projects in life. And I repeat myself , yes , even the worst things.

So I know that many of these things are very heavy , and many of the things that maybe happen to you are very strong and horrible. But the truth is that the one that is suffering is the victim.

So there is a law in the universe that if you want to keep going to transform yourself , you have to transform what is making you suffer. It 's a law. You can not move forward if you do n't transform the anchor that you have behind.

## Energy Work

So the only way to stop suffering of this is by stopping being the victim. Suffering is a concept related to the root chara. The body is the one that tries to recognize the suffering by survival. It needs to survive.

This is why it 's related to with the root chara because it 's survival in this planet.

So the body interprets the suffering as to clue for victim , for being a victim of anything.

So usually from the subconscious or the conscience , the body will feel like we 'll feel victim of something. Because the key of the body is to survive.

So anything that will represent a physical or an emotional pain will be interpreted by the body as a victimization.

So what I have to do is to change the idea of the victimization.

So can use the energy of suffering for something else with a different focus. The basic thing that we have to do is to face the trauma to understand it and to picture yourself in the present , trying to understand that you have survived that you are here. And that what can you do with that power of being of having survived the trauma.

Remember that the example , the easy example of this would be the one that you have from the first time you were trying to write a bicycle. In order to , so you realize now that you know how to write a bicycle and the scars that you have.

So you had are the clue to let you know that we 're able to what you do now.

So basically to face the trauma is like going back to the moment and look at the wound to the eyes and then the wood. What I have now , I know how to write a bicycle.

## Q&A

So for that , I have to identify what was my trauma useful for in my life. This is what the task for today is today to write down your trauma and to give them a meaning and a purpose for you today. As much I face the trauma , as much I heal my trauma and I give them a purpose. I start to set myself free from this and through the generations , sadly , suffering wo n't be necessary anymore.

So for the four difficult things to say , I 'm sorry , thank you. I 'm sorry , I love you. Thank you. Quite good.

And for , forgive me. Yeah , forgive me.

Okay. I 'm sorry , forgive me. I love you. Thank you.

## Daily Practice Elements

And then we start to go outside the circuit. The sound of today is the vibration. The statement for today is , I am agreed of creations. The code for today is the soul pattern , the one that makes has a goal and it requires planning , which implicated thoughts.

The raw sound is the pattern that was heard in the cosmic thinking , creating the plan to accomplish its goal. Critical and discarding thing that delivers with and gives the gift of doubt. At the same time , activates the beliefs , patterns that are inherent in history , believes that determine families , groups , cultures , nations , states , philosophies and religions.

## Energy Work

So let 's go to the root , to all the truss and pains and things that are there. Stopped there. Let 's bring it to our hands. I begin to stretch the body to young.

I make a tiny massage to the body. The attention to your breathing and feel the oxygen coming through your nose towards the lungs , heart , blood. Organs and muscles. Take a deep breath and allow yourself to fall down within looking for a cell.

Picture it bigger and bigger as your body. Until you feel it in front of you. Take a deep breath and go within the cell , filling yourself floating in the sea of the blast. With your hands , take the chromosomes in the core of the cell and start to pray until you feel the chain of NA curling in your fingers.

Recognize that they are the cause that makes you be who you are. Take a deep breath and recognize that you are in a mother cell within the womb of your mother. I am a neg. I watch over me and I feel the light of the eye am coming towards me in this power within the shape of an espermatisoid.

I perceive how this espermatisoid touches the egg , changing its balladity , making it shine as the sun. Take a deep breath and allow the light of the eye am to come within in the shape of the spiral. Come in down through the crown , with your eye , throat , heart , plexus. And from there , its genetic material starts to be spread through the scrum , the root , knees and feet.

I feel how through my ulcers , my cell starts to divide into two. Myself , I , here , and in front of me , I am Joseph. I perceive how this cell is to divide in four , eight , sixteen and so on until the cells start to get organs , muscles , bones , my entire body. I feel the cells creating my heart , my brain , stomach , intestines , lungs.

Until I start to perceive my feet , legs , hands , arms and head. I recognize the pressure of the human , the pressure of biology , genetics and life. And I become aware of the pressure that I will receive in the life I 'm heading to. I become aware , heading to the light , that all this pressure is the one that will help me to activate my potential.

I start to sound , activate the potential of each one of the creations that forms me , of the speed of creations that connects my whole body. Through the sound , recognize the pressure , pushing outside. I begin to perceive how my crown is outside in the light of the outer world.

Now my head starts to pull outside. Neck , shoulders , arms and hands , back , chest , stomach and waist. My hip enters all outside in the light of the world. I recognize from now on I am agreed of creations , I am agreed of creations.

And all the pressure of the world is the energy that I will use to create. I recognize from now on I am agreed of creations. I recognize from now on I am agreed of creations.

So , I take my hands to my heart. I recognize that every trauma , every pressure that I have received in my life are the energies that I will use to tourism my body. I recognize that every trauma , every pressure that I have received in my life are the energies that I will use to tourism the flowers , to blossom and to create for I am agreed of creations. I take a deep breath and begin to bring through all your body the sadness , crossing , stretching and warning.

And come back here and now open your eyes.

So , something for you to know is that as we eat , biting with the place from where we receive the energy around is through the joints in all. And all the energy from where we are with a lot of energy we will fit the vibrating that is coming out from my teeth , vibrating.

So , we have here a hole where the energy comes in and another hole down there the anus through where the energy goes out.

So , from this one I assimilate the energy , absorb the energy and from the other one I affirm the energy.

So , are the two doors , conducts that must be in balance.

So , this is the beginning and the ending of the digestive system of life. First , I absorb the energy to create what I am and then at the last spot I affirm that energy who I am.

So , thank you for being there , for being part of this path and see you tomorrow for me.
