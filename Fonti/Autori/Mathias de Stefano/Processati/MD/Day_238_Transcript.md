**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Knees
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Humility and Honoring Our Earthly Nature
- **Vibration:** `Tu`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Manifested History`
- **Code:** Capricorn - when all the answers are found, it's the moment for confinement and materializing new truth. The stellar winter came and the goat is heading to the cave to lock up in its sacred space of loneliness where it will process everything learned on its journeys, where it will write its books, leave its legacies and recess its thoughts over and over again until making them palpable and absolute on earth. It's pragmatic, barely spirit that won't stop until achieving the best version of itself.

## Overview

Today we are in Abydos, Egypt, in front of the Temple of Seti the First. Behind is the Temple of Ramses II. This is one of the places where you can touch an Atlantean Temple—the Osireion Temple, named after the god Osiris.

This temple is special because here you can find the **Flower of Life**. The famous Flower of Life was done here, and it's really amazing because now when you see it, you can tell that it was done by a laser. It's the most ancient place where you can find the Flower of Life. There's not only one flower of life, there are like 16 of them, but there's only one that you can see the best.

For Matias personally, this place is special because in that time, in the Atlantean Temple, certain women used to come to this place to give birth. According to his memories, here was the place where he gave birth to his two kids in that time.

Today we explore the topic of **humility**, related to the knees in the Physical Week of Pisces.

## The Cultural Misunderstanding of Humility

### What We Think Humility Is

In our cultures, when we hear the word humility, we usually relate this with being poor, like being poor in many senses.

We usually say that someone is humble, has humility when:
- They don't have material things
- They don't show everything of themselves
- They're quiet
- They shut up
- They don't show themselves
- They don't have things

This is the concept that we have usually in our culture regarding humility. And we are pushed to be like this, somehow in our cultures.

---

## The True Etymology of Humility

### Humility = Human

**Humility** has the same root as **human**.

Where does human come from? From the Latin word **humus**.

**Humus** means **wet land**, **wet soil**.

The origin of the word is humus. So humility, human, humility—all have the same etymology: **wet land**.

### People of the Wet Lands

This is because in history, we described humans as the people that came from earth and water.

That's why we are the humans—the people from the wet lands.

The quality of being a person that comes from the wet land is called **humility**.

---

## Humility as Living in Harmony with Nature

### An Earth Being

Basically, when we are speaking about humility, we're describing the attribute of being a person from earth—an **earth being**.

Humility was describing the attributes or the ability of this being to **live in harmony with the rest of the world, with nature**.

---

## When Humans Became Nomads

### Looking to the Skies

In the moment when humans stopped living in forests and we started to be nomads, searching for new food, for new lands to take food from, water and so on, we had to adapt to many different geographies.

It was so difficult to know what we were doing. It was so difficult to know where we were heading to, that we had to start to look for the only things that are always there: the stars, the sun, and the moon.

### Following the Stars

When we started to become nomads, we stopped looking into the nature exactly, and we started to watch the skies to see the stars.

This concept of being nomads following the stars created the idea that **the stars are guiding our lives**.

The wise people that were guiding us through life had died. Suddenly they said their spirits are guiding us, exactly like the stars.

### Souls Going to the Heavens

In that moment is when we started to believe that the souls of the people went to the heavens, to the stars, and they were guiding us like the stars used to do.

These nomad people that started to walk around the planet and started to look into the skies more than the ground, they started to see how the stars, the bright things in the heavens, were guiding us every day.

We created the idea that that was the good thing to follow.

---

## Creating Gods in the Sky

### From Brightness Came Divinity

We created the images of the holy—the things that are bright in this sky.

What was the Indo-European language word for brightness? It was **De**.

De is day, day is De, the unity. From that we have the words, Latin words like **Deus**, **Dios**, which is **God**.

In this way we created gods because of the things that were bright in the sky.

### Leaving the Earth

But we started to believe that in order to follow those gods in the sky, we need to **leave the earth**.

---

## Two Different Traditions

### Those Who Believed Gods Created Life to Enjoy

Some traditions used to believe that the gods created all this in order for us, their kids, to enjoy this reality, this life.

These people were much more:
- Democratic
- Political
- Republican

They started to create systems of society in which every island or every region had its own gods. They had their differences, but they shared ideas. They created:
- The parliament
- Public squares to share ideas and thoughts

That was the structure of that society that used to believe in many gods.

### Those Who Believed Gods Punished Us

For other traditions, the gods were punishing us because of our mistakes. They sent us here to live because we suffer here.

The people that believed that the gods punished us with the idea of being here in this life, they thought of God with the image of the **father that punished his kids** because they did something wrong.

Because of this idea of only one god, they also needed the image of only one father. So they created:
- **Imperialism**
- **Oligarchy**

Only one guy that ruled over the rest like a god—a king, a president, and those images that are pyramidal to control the rest of the people that are the kids.

---

## Why Empires Spread

### Easier to Run

It's really much more easy to run an oligarchy and an empire than a democratic republic.

Why? Because:
- In an oligarchy and an empire, it's much easier to solve a problem by only one person
- In democracy, it's so difficult because many people have to agree and it takes time

A lot of people, because of being threatened, decided to be part of an empire. So one person can defend everyone and take decisions for everyone.

### Monotheistic Religions and Control

This made that the monotheistic religions were much more useful for the oligarchy empires.

Systems of monotheism like:
- Islam
- Christianity
- Judaism

These were religions that were taken by the empires because it was easier to control a system.

That's why they were trying to use this in Europe, in Asia, in Africa. And then by colonialism, it spread into the rest of the world—in America, Australia, Asia, and so on.

The use of democracy of the religions, the monotheistic religions, were really useful for the systems to create a planetary government and much more easy to run.

---

## Two Paths of Humility

### Humility from Humanism

Because of this spread of monotheism, the ideas of humility according to the humanistic point of view were left behind.

And the humility from the point of view of **humiliation** was taken as a system.

These are the two paths that humanity could have taken:

1. **Humility from humanism**: the idea that we have to enjoy the life of the creation
2. **Humility from humiliation**: the one that says life is not to enjoy; you have to do hard work in order to survive, on your knees, on the ground

### Empires Choose Humiliation

Of course, for an empire it's much more easier to use the system of humiliation than the system of humanism.

Christianity was taken in order to politically take control over Europe in one system.

---

## Humility as Humiliation

### The Christian Concept

That's why all the cultures that came from the Mediterranean cultures in the past usually have this idea of humility being humiliation.

**Humiliation** is the word to put your knees on the ground and to be under the control of others.

### Not Showing Your Potential

When we speak about humility today, we usually refer to the idea of humility according to Christianity, in which this philosophy is to say that to be humble, you need to:
- Be poor
- Not have things
- Try not to show up a lot of what you have within
- Not make a difference between the people

Actually, the idea of humility from this point of view is to **not awaken the potential of each one of the persons**. So everyone can be very low, thinking exactly the same, and much more easy to be controlled in the system.

---

## The Humanistic Humility

### Recognizing We Are Human

The humanistic humility is to recognize that we are humans.

This is the first step—to recognize that we are humans, that humanity is an aspect of this reality that we are part of. We are part of this reality that we have to love, this reality. And that this is our own creation, that we have our own divinity inside.

We have to respect the divinity of others.

### Divinity Is Everywhere

Humility is to respect the divinity in everything that is here in life and in the universe.

The entire creation is not to say that the divinity is only in the sky, but the divinity is here, everywhere.

### Learning from Everything

By humility is accepting that:
- The trees
- The plants
- The animals
- The stones

Everyone has something to teach me. Everyone has something to give to me to understand the world.

To be humble, to work with humility, is to **take a seat into the earth** and understand that I have something to learn from everyone in this reality, from everything.

From everything that exists here, I can learn much more from an insect maybe than from a master. I have greater things to learn from nature than from the things in the sky.

---

## We Also Shine in the Sky

### Earth Is a Star Too

To be humble and connected to the humility in the humanistic point of view is to remember that the divinity is not up there in the heavens and we have to leave the ground, the earth, in order to reach the divinity.

To be humble with this idea is basically to remember that **the earth is also levitating in between the stars**. And from the point of view from other planets and other stars, **we also shine in the sky**.

---

## Humility Is Not About Having Less

### Accepting Divinity in All

Humility is not related to not having things or to being less than others.

It's about recognizing that:
- You have your own divinity being human in this earth
- You can and must accept the divinity in others

When you accept that truth in others, you are able to learn from others—not expecting that learning from someone that is wiser, but being open to learn from anything, everything, that maybe is just an insect.

---

## The Problem with Judging Humility

### Judging Is Not Humble

Sometimes when we use this concept of humility, we kind of judge the others by saying if that person is humble or not.

By trying to reach people that are humble, we are not being humble, judging the ability of being humble of others.

### When Others' Brightness Bothers You

This happens because humility is about accepting the brightness of others as you shine yourself.

When the shine of others is bothering you usually, it's because **you don't realize your own brightness** and you start to judge the brightness of others.

And that creates the conflict of your own humility.

---

## Humility Is Shining Together

### Learning from Each Other's Light

Humility is to learn about the brightness of others, to learn to shine with others.

Humility is not about looking to the skies to follow the brightness of the stars. It's to recognize how you and the things of this world can shine too and discover that ability here.

### Coming Back to Earth

Remember: humility is earth—to come back to earth. And that would be the basis for humanism.

---

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortable. Close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing. Breathe deeply.

Take a deep breath and start to massage slowly each part of your body, from your feet to your head, becoming aware of each part of your body.

Feel the feet, the legs, the genitals, hips, waist and back, chest, hands, arms and shoulders, neck, face and head.

### Bringing Hands to Knees

Softly bring my hands to my knees. Start to massage softly, bringing all this energy to your knees.

I become aware and remember that here in my knees, there are many ancestors. The pain that may be here is all of them here.

### Honoring the Ancestors

I become aware that I wouldn't be able to be here today if it is not because of every action, emotion, and belief of my ancestors.

I recognize that in every act, every emotion, and every thought, I am honoring my ancestors.

### Connecting with Lineage

I connect with the image of my parents, my grandparents, the fathers and mothers of my parents. I keep looking way far away in the past for every generation, back in time, to all of them through every country, through the ascension, culture.

And I allow myself to feel how they come to me.

### Going Back in Time

I keep going backwards, featuring the hominids, the apes, all the mammals, reptilians, amphibians, fishes, the multiple cell living beings, unicellular organisms.

I picture all the history of my ancestors till the very end, till the very beginning.

### Recognizing the Result

Take a deep breath, and I recognize that I am the result here and now because of everything, all that I have learned from each one of them in the past.

### The Temple of the Body

The greatest action of humility is to honor each and every one of the beings that taught me something to be who I am. Here and now, **my body is their temple**.

I am the earth. I am human. And I honor to be a human.

### Sending to the Future

I take a deep breath and I express my teaching towards all of them in the future for them to have this humility.

**Tu. Tu. Tu.**

**I am the earth. I am the earth.**

**I am the manifested history. I am the manifested history.**

**I believe in the world. I believe in the world.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and softly begin to bring this consciousness all around your body, stretching and warming.

## Integration

### Daily Practice

Today, practice learning from something "humble" in nature—a plant, an insect, a stone.

Ask: "What is this teaching me?"

### Recognizing Your Ancestors

Place your hands on your knees. Feel the lineage that brought you here.

Say: "I honor all those who came before me. My body is their temple."

### When Someone's Brightness Bothers You

Notice when you judge someone for "showing off" or "not being humble."

Ask yourself: "Am I bothered because I haven't recognized my own light?"

---

## Week Context

We are completing the **Physical Week of Pisces**, grounding the spiritual and emotional lessons into embodied practice.

The knees chakra connects us to our ancestors, our lineage, our path through time. Humility here means: "I recognize I am part of the earth, part of the lineage of all beings who came before me."

Tomorrow is the last day of Pisces. We honor our earthly nature before entering Aries—the fire of new beginnings.

## Q&A

### Q: How do I practice humility without becoming a doormat?

True humility isn't about diminishing yourself. It's about recognizing the divinity in all things equally—including yourself. You can shine brightly and still be humble by honoring the light in others too.

### Q: Is it humble to be proud of my accomplishments?

Yes, if you recognize that your accomplishments came from the lineage of all who taught you, all who came before you. Your body is their temple. Your success is their success. That's humble pride.

### Q: How does this relate to environmental issues?

Humility is remembering we are earth beings, not separate from nature. When we harm the earth, we harm ourselves. True humility would mean living in harmony with all of creation, not dominating it.

### Q: What if I was raised in a culture that values humiliation-style humility?

You can honor the intention (recognizing something greater than ego) while releasing the distortion (self-diminishment). Reframe humility as honoring the earth, the ancestors, the divinity in all things—including yourself.

### Q: How do I learn from an insect?

By observing without judgment. Watch how it moves, how it creates, how it survives. Ask: "What does this being know that I don't?" Often the smallest creatures teach the greatest lessons about persistence, cooperation, transformation.

### Q: Why is humility connected to the knees?

The knees connect us to our ancestors (the lineage we walk upon) and to the earth (we kneel on the ground). True humility is kneeling not in submission, but in reverence for the earth and all who walked before us.

### Q: How do I stop judging others for not being humble?

Recognize that your judgment is showing you where you haven't accepted your own light. When you're comfortable with your own brightness, others' brightness doesn't threaten you—it inspires you.
