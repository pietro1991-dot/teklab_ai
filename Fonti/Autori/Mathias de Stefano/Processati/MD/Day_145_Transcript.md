## Overview

On December 26th, we journey to the continent of Asia, the solar plexus of the planet Earth. Today's alignment explores how Asia shaped humanity's cultural identity and gave birth to the concept of "I Am" as a civilization. Matias shares this teaching from a cinema after watching the movie "Soul," which he highly recommends as it beautifully connects to today's themes.

Asia is where humanity first declared, "I am human. I am a thinking being." This is where homosapiens became homosapiens sapiens—the human that truly thinks, the one capable of creating cultures and civilizations. The continent holds the geographical and spiritual center of self-awareness in Tibet, where information from the deepest oceans meets the highest peaks of the sky.

Today's vibration is "THï," combining the celestial (TH) with the being (ï). The statement "I Am the Ethereal Being" reminds us that we exist in the subconscious ocean that connects all of humanity. The code speaks of the subconscious as the ocean where we all swim, never having left, containing and uniting us all.

## Core Teaching

### The Geography of Asia

The continent of Asia is related to the solar plexus of the planet. It is one of the biggest continents, but we must understand its true geographical boundaries.

The Middle East, also called Asia Minor, is not actually part of the Asian continent. That territory was once a group of islands that united when the pressure of Africa and Asia came together, creating the mountains and regions of the Middle East.

Asia has two other territories within it that seem to be Asia but are not. The first is the north of Siberia, which is connected to North America—a different plateau. The second is India. Geologically, India is connected to Australia, not Asia.

### The Formation of the Himalayas

When Australia started to move toward the north, India also started to move faster north and pushed inside the continent of Asia. This pressure that India created started to raise the land, creating the Himalayas and, of course, Tibet.

The limit of Asia with Europe can be seen in the Ural Mountains. They start in Novaya Zemlya, an island in the Arctic, and go down through the Ural Mountains toward the Caspian Sea.

In the south, the continent of Asia arrives at all the islands of Indonesia, but not Papua Island, because Papua is connected to Oceania.

### Asia: The Molder of Humanity

The continent of Asia is basically the one that molded humanity. From 300,000 years ago to a million years ago, the changes of Asia were shaping the way we survived in the world.

The explosion of the Toba volcano in Sumatra Island changed the whole weather and environment in Siberia. What happened to humans in that continent basically shaped the idea of who we are as homosapiens.

This is why this continent was the one that said to humans: "You are this. You are humans." In Asia was the first continent where we could say, "I am. I am human."

### From Homosapiens to Homosapiens Sapiens

Homosapiens means "the human that thinks." Due to the process we lived through in Asia, we became homosapiens sapiens—the human that really is thinking. This means the humanity that started to be the one able to create cultures, the one able to create civilizations.

### The Indo-European People

We all have a common ancestor regarding our philosophy, our way of talking, our traditions, and cultures. We all come from the people we call the Indo-Europeans.

These people were living around the Caspian Sea in the lands of the Great Stan, mainly in the Kazakhstan regions and southern Russia. They spread toward India and also to Europe, to the plains of Hungary.

All this territory was the region of the Indo-European people because they connected from India to Europe. These people were the basement, the seed of all our traditions and thoughts of Asia and Europe.

All the ways of thinking, the philosophy, and the traditions that we share in the biggest part of humanity come from those people—the Indo-European people.

### The Great Stan

The great territory of Stan, where the Indo-European people used to live, is very important because "Stan" means "the land of."

We call the Great Stan all the territories of countries that end in "stan": Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan. All these countries are the Great Stan.

This territory, plus the Manas territories (China, Mongolia, Siberia), are the ones that molded the way of thinking of the whole world.

### The Spread of Culture from Asia

The people from the Great Stan, the Indo-European people, started to expand toward the West. These people populated the regions of Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East.

From the Middle East, they started to conquer North Africa. From half of Africa to the West and North, all the traditions came from the Middle East, which came from the Great Stan.

On the other hand, we have populations from the Indo region—India, the rivers of India, Tibet, the Taklamakan Desert. From there, they started to go to the East, populating the south of Asia and then going up toward Mongolia, China, and Siberia. They also went south through Indonesia, populating Australia and the Pacific Ocean.

### The Migration to the Americas

The people from the north of Asia started to migrate toward Alaska and North America, spreading all through North America. From the south, they started to go to the Pacific Ocean, reaching Chile, and from there they populated South America. They came together in Central America.

As you see, all the cultures from the Americas were basically born in the center of Asia. Even though humans were born in Africa, from Africa they went to the Middle East, and from there to Asia. From Asia, they started to expand toward all the world.

### The Cultural "I Am" Born in Asia

The idea of the cultural being, the civilization saying "This is me, I am"—all these bases of every culture around the world were born in the center of Asia.

The center of all this power of acknowledging yourself is the center of Asia, which is Tibet. It's not because of the Tibetan culture—it's because of the geography.

### Tibet: Where Ocean Meets Sky

The reason why Tibet is so important is because of geography. Thousands and millions of years ago, Tibet was the region of a great sea called the Tethys.

Tethys was a big sea between Oceania and Asia. When India went to this region, it started to bring that ocean, that sea, toward the sky. All the information from the oceans went up toward the highest spot of the planet.

The inner part of the planet was connected to the highest point in the sky. This means the highest peaks of the world are the youngest mountains of the world, and they have the information from the deepest part of the oceans.

This territory, Tibet, is the one that holds the information of the skies, the earth, and the seas. All this information got stuck in the center of Asia.

### Finding the Self in Tibet

All the people that used to go to Tibet found the information of the whole planet. They understood how to become their own planet, how to become their own self.

This is why in this territory of Asia the "I Am" was built, and the cultures related to the "I Am" were born. That's why Eastern cultures are the ones that help us understand all the different concepts of the "I Am."

### Shamanism Born in Asia

Some may ask, "Why all of Asia? In America, shamanism has all this information too."

Well, shamanism wasn't born in America. Shamanism was born in Mongolia, in the Gobi Desert and the territories of Siberia, in Lake Baikal.

In all that territory, women were the first ones to become shamans, connecting to the earth. Then they taught men how to use it. Shamanism started in northern Asia.

### All Cultures Connected Through the "I Am"

All cultures are connected as cultural beings in philosophy related to the "I Am." This is because all cultures were born in the center of Asia where the "I Am" was created.

When we speak about the "I Am" and picture the whole world, we have to think that this center of the "I Am" is connected to the plexus, the center of the self, which is in Asia—specifically Tibet.

### The Current State of the Solar Plexus

One of the things to reflect on today is the relationship we have with the "I Am," reflected by the actions of countries in those territories. They are not working exactly with the "I Am." They are just fighting against each other, trying to control one another.

For example, the plexus (Tibet) is under the power of China, which is the stomach. The "I Am" is basically under the pressure of the processor of the world.

This is why we have conflicts in our self as humanity related to the "I Am."

### The Fractal of the Self

This takes us to the fractal of this: How do you relate yourself with the "I Am"?

Are you free to express who you are, or are you just living through the perceptions of others? Do you just do whatever other ones are trying to tell you to do, or are you really free to be who you really are?

Just think about that, and you will acknowledge how humanity—all of us together—are living this reality.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Reflect on your relationship with your "I Am." Are you free to express who you really are, or are you just doing what others expect of you? Notice throughout the day when you act from your authentic self versus when you act from the perceptions and expectations of others.

### Applying This Teaching

Recognize that Asia's current struggles—Tibet under pressure from China—reflect humanity's collective struggle with the "I Am." Your personal struggle to express your authentic self mirrors the planetary struggle. By freeing your own "I Am" from external pressures and expectations, you contribute to freeing humanity's collective "I Am."

## Q&A

### Q: Why is Asia considered the solar plexus of the planet?

Asia is the solar plexus because it is the center where humanity's sense of self—the "I Am"—was born. Just as the solar plexus is the center of personal identity and power in the body, Asia is where cultural identity and self-awareness emerged for humanity.

### Q: What is the difference between homosapiens and homosapiens sapiens?

Homosapiens means "the human that thinks." Homosapiens sapiens means "the human that really is thinking"—the humanity that became able to create cultures and civilizations. This evolution happened through the experiences humans had in Asia.

### Q: Who are the Indo-European people and why are they important?

The Indo-European people lived around the Caspian Sea in the Great Stan region. They are the common ancestors of most human philosophy, language, traditions, and cultures. They spread from India to Europe, creating the foundation for the ways of thinking shared across most of humanity.

### Q: Why is Tibet so spiritually significant?

Tibet's significance comes from its geography. It was once the Tethys Sea, and when India pushed into Asia, it raised the ocean to the highest peaks. Tibet holds information from the deepest oceans and the highest sky—the earth, sea, and sky all meeting. This is why people who went there understood how to become their own planet, their own self.

### Q: Where did shamanism originate?

Shamanism was born in northern Asia—specifically Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, and the territories of Siberia around Lake Baikal. Women were the first shamans, connecting to the earth, and then they taught men. From there, shamanism spread to the Americas and other parts of the world.

### Q: What does it mean that Tibet is "under pressure from China"?

On a planetary level, Tibet represents the solar plexus (the "I Am"), and China represents the stomach (the processor). Tibet being under Chinese control symbolizes how the "I Am"—our authentic self—is under pressure from the processor, the system that wants to control and digest. This reflects humanity's struggle to express authentic identity against external control.

### Q: How does Asia's story relate to my personal "I Am"?

Asia's geographical and cultural history mirrors your personal journey of self-discovery. Just as all cultures found their "I Am" in the center of Asia, you must find your authentic self at your own center. The current pressure on Tibet reflects how your own "I Am" may be under pressure from external expectations and control.

### Q: What is the subconscious code about?

The subconscious is described as "the ocean where we all swim, from where we've never left." It contains, unites, records, and moves us all. What happens in the subconscious happens to all of us. It is the shared ocean of humanity's collective consciousness, connecting us all beyond individual awareness.
