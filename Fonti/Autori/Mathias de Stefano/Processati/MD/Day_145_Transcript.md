## Introduction

Hi everyone. How are you? I hope you are listening to me. I hope you , most of all , I hope you are hearing me.

Good morning , good afternoon , good evening. First of all , I will tell you that I am in a very different situation for a person , which is very from the third dimension.

The reason why the environment is different is because I love to go to the cinema. It 's been many months without going to cinema and just discover that there is a cinema close by. But we did n't made the right timing.

So the movie has just ended , so we would n't be able to arrive to the hotel.

So that 's why I 'm here in the cinema. And we came to see the movie Soul , which is very beautiful.

So I really recommend this movie because really it 's incredible.

So today , the topic is Asia , the continent Asia.

So to be to go to the point , the Asia continent is related to the solar plexus of the planet.

So we are going to talk about the main territory of Asia. Like Middle East. Middle East was also called Asia Minor or Asia Minor. But it 's not part of the continent because that territory once was a group of islands that got all united when the pressure of African Asia got together.

So that 's how they connected and created the mountains and this regions of Middle East.

So the continent of Asia is one of the biggest one , but also has two other territories within Asia that they seem to be Asia , but they are not. And those are one in the north , which is the north of Siberia , which is connected to North America. It 's a different plateau connected to North America. And the other one is India.

India , we all think that is connected to Asia , that is part of Asia , but geological it 's connected to Australia.

So when Australia started to move towards the north , India started to also move faster to the north and got inside the continent of Asia.

So this pressure that India created started to make to rise up the land creating the Himalayas. And of course , the , of course , the Tibet.

So also the limit of Asia with Europe , sometimes we do n't see it , we can not appreciate it , but we can see the limit in the euro mountains. And they start in Nova Zambia , which is an island in the Arctic. And from there it goes down in the euro mountains towards until the Asian Sea.

So in the south , the continent of Asia arrives until all the islands of Indonesia , but not the Papua island , because Papua is connected to Oceania.

So I invite you to see some map if you can.

So you can get , you can get to know the solar plexus of the , of the body.

So you , you can relate with that part of the body that we all are.

So that would be the whole Asia.

So when you see the maps , you can. You can perceive it and you can just get to know a little bit better your plexus. The continent of Asia is basically the one that molded the humanity , because from 300,000 years ago , till a million years ago , the changes of Asia were basically shaping the way in which we survived in the world , like the explosion of the Told volcano in Sumatra Island , changed the whole weather , changed the environment in , in Siberia.

So so what happened to humans in that continent basically shaped the idea of who we are of as homosapiens.

So this is why this continent was , was the one that said to the humans , hey , you are this , you are humans.

So in Asia was the first continent in which we could say , I am , I am human.

So remember that homosapiens means the human that thinks , okay.

So human that things and due to the process that we lived in Asia , we become to be homosapiens sapiens. Homosapiens sapiens would be the human that really is thinking , okay , a lot.

So this means the humanity that started to be , to be the one able to create cultures , the one able to create civilizations and so on. Also important to know that we all have the common ancestor regarding our philosophy , our way of talking , our traditions , cultures. We all come from the people that we use that we call the Indo-European. And those people were living around the Asian Sea in the lands of the Great Sun , mainly in the Kazakhstan regions and the southern Russia.

And they spread towards the India and also to Europe to the plains of Hungary.

So all this territory was the region of the people called the Indo-Europeans because they connected from India to Europe. These people basically were the basement , the seed of all our traditions , of all the thoughts of Asia and Europe.

So all the ways of thinking , the philosophy , the traditions that we have sharing in the biggest part of humanity comes from those people from the Indo-European people.

Okay.

So this is why the great territory of Sun , where the Indo-European people used to live , is very , very important because Sun means the land of , okay.

So we call the Great Sun , all the territories of the countries that end in Sun , like Pakistan , Afghanistan , Turkmenistan , Tajikistan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , all these countries.

So all these countries are the Great Sun. And this territory , plus the Minus territories , which is the China Mongolia , Siberia , all these territories , are the ones that molded the way of thinking of the whole world. And now we are going to see why. The first thing is because the people from the Great Sun , so the Indo-European people , they started to expand towards the West.

So all these people were populated in the regions of Europe , Mediterranean Sea , and of course the Middle East.

So from Middle East then they started to conquered the North and Africa.

So from the half of Africa to the West North , all the traditions came from the Middle East that came from the Great Sun. And in the other hand , we have this other populations from the Indo region , which is the India , the rivers from India , and Tibet , Tehlamak and desert , all this territory. And from there they started to go to the East , all of them went to the East.

So they populated the south of Asia , all these countries from the south of Asia. And then they went up towards Mongolia , China , Siberia , and towards the south through Indonesia , populating Australia and the Pacific and the Pacific Ocean.

So they spread towards the East , the opposite of the Sun people.

## Q&A

So you will see that the people from the North of Asia , they start to migrate towards Alaska and North America. They spread all through North America. And from the south they start to go to the Pacific Ocean , they go to Chile , and from there they start to populate South America , and they get together in Central America.

So as you see , all the cultures from the Americas , they basically were born in the center of Asia. Even if humans were born in Africa , from Africa they started to go up towards Middle East and from there they went to Asia.

So from Asia they started to expand towards all the world.

So that 's why the idea of the cultural being the civilization saying , this is me , I am. All these bases of every culture around the world was born in the center of Asia. The center of all this power of acknowledging yourself is the center of Asia , which is Tibet. And it 's not because of the Tibetan culture , it 's because of the geography , okay , is the geography of Tibet that gives that power.

So the reason why the Tibet is so important is because of the geography. Thousands and millions of years ago , Tibet was the region of a great sea that we call the Tetris. Tetris was a big sea in between Oceania and Asia. And when the India went to this region , it started to bring that ocean that sea towards the sky.

So all the inner lands , the information from the oceans went up towards the highest spot of the planet.

So the inner part of the planet was connected to the highest point in the sky.

So this means that the highest peaks of the world , they are the youngest mountains of the world. And they have the information from the deepest part of the oceans.

So this territory , the Tibet , is the one that holds the information of the skies , the earth and the seas.

So it 's , it got stuck in the center , all this information got stuck in the center of Asia. And so why all the people that used to go there , they found the information of the whole planet.

So they understood how to become their own planet , how to become their own self.

So this is why in this territory of Asia is where the AM was built. And the cultures related to the AM were born. And that 's why the Eastern cultures are the ones that helps us to understand all the different concepts of the AM.

So of course some of you may say why all the Asia , because in America , the Humanism has all this information too. Well , because Humanism was n't born in America , Humanism was born in Mongolia. Humanism was born in the goby desert and the territories of Siberia , in the Final Lake.

So in all that territory , the women were the first ones on becoming Chapman 's , connecting to the earth. And then they taught to men how to use it.

So Humanism started in North and Asia.

So as you see , all the cultures are connected in the center of our connected as a cultural beings in philosophy related to the AM. And this is basically because all the cultures were born in the center of Asia where the AM was created.

So when we are speaking about the AM and picture in the whole world , we have to think that this center of the AM is connected to the Blacks , the center of the self , which is in Asia.

So the center , which is the Tibet. One of the things that I wrote today in the blog is the relationship that we have today with AM is reflected by the actions of the countries in those territories. They are not working exactly with AM. They are just fighting against each other , trying to control one another.

So for example , the Plexus , which is Tibet , is under the power of China , which is the stomach.

So we are the AM is basically under the pressure of the processor of the world.

So that 's why we have this conflicts in our self as humanity related to the AM.

So this takes us to the fractal of this.

So how do you relate yourself with the AM? Are you free to express who you are or are you just living through the perceptions of others? You just want you just to whatever the other ones are trying to tell you to do or you or you really are a threat of being who you really are. Just try to think about that and you will acknowledge how humanity all us together are living this reality.

Just to think about this relationship. There are so many things to talk about this , but remember I wrote a little bit more , I guess , in the blog of today. In the post of today in the blog , remember the blog is just soy. Red.

Okay , AM in Spanish and red , which is not the color. It means I am in the phone.

So I can not read anything from the phone.

## Daily Practice Elements

So I 'm going to use to it. The vibration for today is here. The statement for today is AM , the ethereal being. The code for today is the subconscious.

It says there were all options combined. Lines the list the first of the great consciousness. The one that is deprived of all purposes patterns , objectives , logic , directions , space of or time. We could say that the subconscious is the ocean where we all swim from where we 've never left something that contains us all unites.

Records and moves us all. And what happens in it happens to us all to all of us.

So as you see the subconscious , the information of today is kind of like saying , we have all Asia within because we all come from there.

So we sit comfortable to sit for a moment and align with the continent of Asia. We sit comfortable with comfortable bodies. I remember that I am in this big great sphere of celestial color , light blue and white light. I find myself seated on my heart and do it.

I remember that my body is extension of the animal kingdom. And through my thoughts , I help all them to light too. I remember that I am in this world. I remember that I am in this world.

I remember that I am in this world. I remember that I am in this world. The stage of the iron. And this is how I look into the horizon , the celestial light blue sky.

For the mountains of the world. And the cast can see , it starts to be shining by the sun rising in the east. I take you to the ground. I see a cyaproge , the great plains of the great stun.

And the forest. The cold forest of Siberia. And in the mountains of the outside. The change that protects and hold.

The tackle of my condenser. I see a mirrored horizon of the highest mountains of the Karakoran. In the region of Tamil. Going down to the mountains of Pakistan.

And I expand through the eternal and thousands of colors of India. I feel the great forest and rainforest of Indonesia. Myanmar , Thailand , Vietnam , Cambodia , Laos. And the mountains of the mountains.

I go to the mountains. Watch. How they arise. Put in the lightest.

And the green fields and mountains.

So the highest peaks of white , celestial , in the sky. As I go to the east. I feel the great China. It 's wisdom touching the seeds of the sun.

Observing the dragons of Japan. Korea , Taiwan , and Philippines. And I hold to the center of the continent. To the bridge there.

The bridge , the deepest lake of the world. The bridge. The rainbow bridge. And where every chairman has come to earth.

And there I find again the center. The core of the greatest country that holds the one that connects us all. The roof of the planet. See that.

And there in the center of all things. To the void. I find enlightenment. I find enlightenment.

Bye. I am the hero being here. I am the hero being here. I live within each one living thing of one earth.

For all of them are one for me. I am the hero. Take a deep breath. And they recognize the entire continent of Asia in their forces.

And I begin to bring this consciousness all around my body. Come in back here and now. Thank you everybody for being there. Thank you for being I am.

See you tomorrow. As always. At the same time.
