## Overview

On January 21st, Matias begins the **Physical Week** of Capricorn with one of the most sensitive topics in human history: **Religion**. This teaching is not about criticizing or defending any particular religious system, but about **understanding where religion came from, why it was important, and where it got lost in the distortion of reality**.

The word **religion** comes from Latin **"re-ligare"**—**"to tie back,"** to connect again, to bind once more to the source. Religion was meant to be the **system through which humanity reconnects with the divine**, remembers the eternal truth, and finds its way back to the **Tree of Life** that we've been seeking since our ancestors left the African forest with **faith and hope** in finding something greater.

Matias speaks with profound humility and vulnerability, acknowledging that he was born in a Catholic country (Argentina) but raised in an agnostic family, giving him a unique perspective: **neither attached to religion nor superior to it**. He warns that even those who reject religion can become **attached to the dogma of being "above" religious people**—which is itself a form of religious thinking.

The teaching emphasizes **forgiveness and understanding of the past** rather than judgment. If we want to create something new in the future, we cannot build it **against** the past, trying to erase what was "wrong." We must **understand the reasons** why things happened, **forgive** what was done with incomplete understanding, and **use those lessons** to build something better. **The only way to heal the future is through understanding and forgiving the past.**

## Core Teaching

### A Note on Discussing Difficult Topics

Matias begins with an important disclaimer about discussing **religion, politics, and economics**—the three topics traditionally avoided at family dinners.

**He shares his personal context:**
- Born in Argentina, a Catholic country
- Raised in an agnostic family (grandfather was agnostic)
- Never personally religious
- No attachment to specific political ideology
- No fixed economic doctrine

**Why this matters:** Because he doesn't have these "specific documents to think," it's sometimes easier for him to speak about these things **objectively**, not directly tied to his personal identity.

**The warning:** For many people, discussing these issues is difficult **not because they believe in a religion**, but because they have a **culture inside and preconceptions** of what things are.

**The invitation:** Try to be **open to see a different perception**, to see a different option.

### The Preconception Problem (Both Sides)

Matias identifies a critical issue that affects **both** religious and non-religious people:

**1. People who lived in a religion:**
- Many want to leave it
- They say "I don't want this anymore"
- They have **preconceptions of religion as something bad**
- They experienced something they want to escape

**2. People who were never religious (like Matias):**
- Can have a **preconception of being SUPERIOR** to religious people
- "They are still attached to one idea" (superiority thinking)
- **This belief of superiority is ALSO a religion**
- Being attached to the concept of being superior **because** you don't have a religion

**Key insight:** Even when we're not religious, we can be **attached to dogma or misconception** about what religion is.

**Both positions can be forms of dogma.** This is important to recognize before entering the teaching.

### The Purpose of Today's Teaching

**What this teaching is NOT:**
- Criticizing religion
- Trying to say religion is bad
- Attacking religious systems or people

**What this teaching IS:**
- Understanding **where religions came from**
- Understanding **why they are important in our process**
- Understanding **where they started to get lost** in the distortion of reality

**The goal:** To give religion **meaning**, not to judge it.

### Etymology: Re-Ligare (To Tie Back)

**Religion** comes from Latin:
- **"Re"** = back, again
- **"Ligare"** = to tie, to bind, to connect

**Religion = to tie back, to tie again, to connect back**

**To what are we tying back?**
- To the **source**
- To the **divine**
- To the **origin**
- To the **Tree of Life**
- To the **truth** we've been seeking

**Religion was meant to be the system through which humanity reconnects with what it lost when it left the garden, the forest, the state of unity.**

### The Origin Story: Leaving the Forest

To understand religion, we must go back **much further than 3,000 or 5,000 years**—back to when **human history began**, even before it was registered in writing.

**The story Matias tells:**

**In the beginning**, we were **animals living in the forest in Africa**, living in the trees, eating the fruits of the trees.

**One day**, there were **no fruits on the tree**.

**The question arose:** "Where can we find more food?"

**Someone said** (in their primitive language): "I heard that **beyond there**, there are more trees with much more food."

**One of them left the forest** with **faith** in that promise—faith that there was something beyond, something better, something worth seeking.

### Faith and Hope: The Beginning of Human Consciousness

**This was the moment we became human:**

**We became beings who:**
- Have **faith** (trust in something unseen)
- Have **hope** (expectation of finding something better)
- Seek something **beyond** what we can see right now

**From that first moment**, every human that came from Africa, looking for food, **started to have faith in finding that big tree of food**—the **Tree of Life**.

**This is why every religion has:**
- A **holy tree**
- A **sacred tree**
- A **Tree of Life**
- A **tree of knowledge**

**The tree is the original symbol of what we're seeking.**

### The Growing Tree of Expectation

As humans traveled, **seeking the tree**, something happened:

**The more they traveled, the bigger the tree became in their imagination.**

They started to make the idea of the tree **so huge, so big**:
- "This tree must grow animals!"
- "Different fruits must grow from this tree!"
- "It should be so big you cannot see the horizon!"
- "It touches the sky!"

**Every day it was so difficult to find this huge tree** that they started to **get comfortable with the trees they found**.

**They settled for smaller trees**, but **never forgot the original promise**—the eternal Tree of Life.

### The Parallel to Modern Relationships

Matias makes a brilliant comparison to modern culture:

**Disney and fairy tales** have done a very good job making us believe that there is **the prince or the princess** we have to find in our life.

**The perfect partner**, the soulmate, the one who completes us.

**But what happens?**
- We keep searching for this "perfect one"
- We get comfortable with the people we find
- We never quite find the Disney ideal
- But we never stop believing it exists

**This is the same pattern as the Tree of Life:**
- We're seeking something eternal, perfect, complete
- We find approximations, temporary satisfactions
- We settle for what we can find
- But we never forget the original promise

**This is human nature—and this is where religion was born.**

### Religion: The System to Tie Us Back

**After thousands of years of seeking the Tree of Life**, humans began to create **systems** to:
- **Remember** the original promise
- **Connect back** to what we lost
- **Tie ourselves** to the eternal truth
- **Guide the search** so we don't get completely lost in smaller trees

**These systems became RELIGION:**
- Rituals to remember
- Teachings to guide
- Communities to support the search
- Symbols (like the tree) to keep the vision alive

**Religion was not meant to control.** Religion was meant to **help us remember what we're seeking and tie us back to the source.**

### Where Religion Got Lost

Matias doesn't detail this extensively in this particular day (likely saving it for later discussions), but he mentions:

**Religion started to get lost in the distortion of reality** when:
- The system became more important than the search
- The institution became more important than the connection
- The control became more important than the liberation
- The smaller trees (temporary teachings) became confused with the eternal Tree (ultimate truth)

**This is the tragedy:** The thing meant to **tie us back** became the thing that **ties us down**.

### Understanding the Past, Not Judging It

**Critical teaching on how to approach history:**

**The wrong approach:**
- "Something in the past was wrong, and we are the good ones."
- "If we erase this part of the past, we will heal the future."
- Judging things from our current perspective
- Building the future **against** the past

**Why this doesn't work:**
- We waste time **not understanding why things happened**
- We cannot heal what we don't understand
- We repeat the same mistakes in new forms

**The right approach:**
- **Forgiveness** heals the future
- **Understanding the reasons** of the past allows healing
- **Gratitude** for the lessons learned (even from mistakes)
- Building the future **with wisdom from** the past

**Matias's powerful statement:**

**"The only way you can heal the past is by forgiving the past, because they gave us the tools to understand: 'Oh, look at this—that was wrong. So I had no idea that would be wrong. Now I know it's wrong, so I will do it better. Thank you, ancient systems, for teaching me what is wrong, so I can do it better in the future.'"**

**That's the way you go into the future—not losing time in the past.**

### The Future Looking Back at Us

**A profound thought experiment:**

**What if we tried to think as someone a thousand years ahead in the future?**

If they look backwards at us, they will see:
- We are like a **religion**, like a **sect**, like a **cult**
- Everything we're doing now (including this spiritual work) is just "people believing they are aware"
- We thought we were "superior to others because we were working with consciousness"
- We thought we were doing good things, but we were doing bad things

**From the future's perspective, we are probably doing everything wrong.**

**Why? Because everything is about evolving in the future.**

**The lesson:** When we try to understand what happened in the past, **we should not judge things from the eyes of the future**.

**Maybe the people doing things "wrong" today were trying to do the best in the beginning, but they had no idea how, so they ended up doing it wrong.**

**This applies to religion, politics, economics, education—everything.**

### Not Wasting Time Blaming

**The temptation:** "Yes, but the Vatican does this, or this person does that, or whatever..."

**The response:** "Yes, of course."

**But why?**

**Because they are the last part of a system that was created for hundreds of years.**

**And now it's our time. Now we have to think in our future, in our new time.**

**If we waste our time trying to blame what happened or what they did in the past, we are not going to heal the past.**

**We heal by:**
- Forgiving
- Understanding
- Learning
- Moving forward with wisdom

**Not by:**
- Blaming
- Judging
- Fighting against
- Trying to erase

### Religion as Divine Essence (Crown Chakra)

**The Crown Chakra** is the connection to the **divine**, to higher consciousness, to the source.

**Religion is the Crown Chakra** of human civilization:
- The system meant to **connect us to the divine**
- The structure meant to **remember the eternal**
- The teaching meant to **guide us back to source**

**"I Am the Divine Essence"** means:
- You ARE the connection to the divine
- You don't need an external system to tie you back—**you ARE the tie**
- You are the **essence** that religion was meant to help you remember

**Religion was meant to point to YOU, not replace you.**

### The Physical Week Context

This is the **first day of the Physical Week**—the week about **embodying, manifesting, grounding** spiritual understanding into **material reality**.

**Why start with Religion?**

Because **religion is the physical system** (institutions, rituals, teachings, communities) through which **spiritual essence** (connection to divine) is meant to be **grounded into human society**.

**The Physical Week will explore all the systems** through which consciousness tries to manifest in the world:
- Religion (spiritual system)
- Politics (governance system)
- Education (knowledge system)
- Economy (resource system)
- Technology (creation system)
- Culture (meaning system)
- Agriculture (sustenance system)

**All are attempts to ground divine essence into material form.**

## Practice

### Meditation: Remembering the Divine Essence

**Note:** Matias doesn't include a formal meditation in this particular transcript, but based on the teaching, here's an aligned practice:

**Setup:** Sit comfortably, close your eyes, take deep breaths.

**Part 1: Remember the Forest**

1. **Imagine yourself as one of the first humans**, living in the forest, eating from the trees.

2. **Feel the safety and abundance** of living in unity with nature.

3. **Then feel the moment of lack**—no fruit on the tree.

4. **Hear the promise:** "Beyond there, there are more trees with much more food."

**Part 2: Feel Faith and Hope Arise**

5. **Feel the birth of faith**—trust in something you haven't seen yet.

6. **Feel the birth of hope**—expectation that you will find something better.

7. **Recognize:** This is the moment you became **conscious**, became **human**, began **seeking**.

**Part 3: See the Tree of Life**

8. **In your imagination, see the eternal Tree of Life**—the one you've been seeking.

9. **See it as huge, magnificent, eternal**—touching the sky, growing infinite fruits.

10. **Recognize:** Every religion, every spiritual system, every teaching is **pointing to this tree**.

**Part 4: Tie Back (Re-Ligare)**

11. **Feel a cord of light** from your **Crown Chakra** extending upward.

12. **This cord ties you back** to the source, to the divine, to the Tree of Life.

13. **You don't need an institution to make this connection**—the connection **is you**.

14. **"Re-ligare"**—tie yourself back, right now, consciously.

**Part 5: Affirm Divine Essence**

15. **"I Am the Divine Essence"** (repeat three times)
    - You are not **seeking** the divine—you **ARE** the divine
    - You are not **separated** from the source—you **ARE** the source manifesting
    - You are not **trying to connect**—you **ARE** the connection

**Part 6: Forgive the Past Systems**

16. **Bring to mind any religious system** (or any system) that hurt you, controlled you, or distorted truth.

17. **Recognize:** They were created by humans **trying to find the Tree of Life**, trying to help others connect, but **getting lost** in the distortion.

18. **Forgive them**—not because what they did was right, but because **understanding and forgiveness heal the future**.

19. **Thank them** for showing you what **not** to do, so you can do better.

**Closing:**

20. **Breathe deeply** and return to the present moment.

21. **Place your hand on your Crown Chakra** (top of your head) and feel the **divine essence** that you are.

22. **Know:** You don't need to **find** the Tree of Life—**you ARE the tree**, rooted in earth, reaching to heaven, bearing the fruits of consciousness.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Throughout the day, practice conscious re-ligare:**

1. **Notice when you judge** religious systems, people, or the past.
   - Pause and ask: "Am I understanding, or just judging?"
   - Can I forgive this, knowing they were trying their best with incomplete understanding?

2. **Notice when you feel superior** for being "spiritual but not religious."
   - Pause and ask: "Is this superiority also a form of dogma?"
   - Am I attached to being 'above' religion?

3. **Practice tying back** (re-ligare) throughout the day:
   - When you feel disconnected, consciously **connect** through your Crown Chakra
   - You don't need a ritual or institution—just **conscious reconnection**

4. **Thank the past** for its lessons:
   - Even the "wrong" things taught you what not to do
   - Gratitude transforms judgment into wisdom

5. **Remember you ARE the Tree of Life:**
   - You are not seeking something external
   - You are the **divine essence** manifesting
   - Your roots go deep, your branches reach high, your fruits feed others

### Applying This Teaching

- **Stop fighting against** old religious systems and **start building** new conscious connections
- **Forgive the distortions** of religion while **honoring the original intention** (to tie back to source)
- **Recognize your own dogmas**—even non-religious people have beliefs they're attached to
- **Understand before judging**—ask "why did this happen?" instead of "how could they do this?"
- **Use your Crown Chakra** to connect directly to the divine, knowing **you are the divine essence**

### Physical Week Context

This week is about **ESSENCE**—the fundamental nature of things when grounded into physical reality.

**Religion is the physical manifestation** (institutions, rituals, communities) **of the spiritual essence** (connection to divine).

**The question for this week:** How do we **embody** divine essence in **material systems** without losing the essence in the structure?

**Tomorrow:** Politics (governance system) and the **Essence of Consciousness**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: Why does Matias say even non-religious people can have a "religion"?

Because **being attached to the dogma of superiority**—thinking "I'm above religious people because I don't have a religion"—**is itself a form of religious thinking**. It's a **preconception**, a **fixed belief**, a **dogma** that you're better than others. **Any attachment to a concept of superiority is a form of religion**, even if it's not traditional religion. True freedom is **not being attached** to either religion OR the superiority of being non-religious.

### Q: What does "re-ligare" (religion) actually mean?

**"Re-ligare"** means **"to tie back"** or **"to connect again."** **"Re"** = back/again, **"ligare"** = to tie/bind/connect. **Religion was meant to be the system that ties humanity back to the source**, reconnects us with the divine, helps us remember the eternal truth we've been seeking since we left the forest. It's about **reconnection**, not control or separation.

### Q: What is the story of leaving the forest and the Tree of Life?

**In the beginning**, humans were animals living in African forests, eating fruit from trees. **One day there was no fruit**, and someone said "beyond there, there are more trees with more food." **One human left with FAITH** in that promise—this was **the birth of faith and hope**, the moment we became **conscious beings seeking something beyond**. We've been seeking the eternal **Tree of Life** ever since, and **every religion has a sacred tree** because this is humanity's original quest.

### Q: Why is it important to forgive and understand the past rather than judge it?

Because **judgment doesn't heal—understanding heals**. If we build the future **against** the past, trying to erase "wrong" things, we **don't understand why they happened**, so we **can't prevent repeating them in new forms**. But if we **understand** the reasons things happened and **forgive** people who were doing their best with incomplete knowledge, we **gain wisdom** to do better. **"Thank you for showing me what's wrong, so I can do it better"—that's how you move into the future.**

### Q: How should we view religious systems from the past (like the Vatican)?

**Not as enemies to fight**, but as **"the last part of systems created hundreds of years ago."** People in those systems were **trying to do the best** they could with the understanding they had. Many things went wrong, but **wasting time blaming them doesn't heal anything**. Instead: **understand why** things went wrong, **forgive** the people involved, **learn** from the mistakes, and **focus on building** something better now. **It's our time to think about our future**, not fight against the past.

### Q: What does "I Am the Divine Essence" mean in relation to religion?

It means **you ARE the connection to the divine**—you don't need an external system to **tie you back** because **you ARE the tie**. Religion was meant to **point to this truth**, to help you **remember** you are divine essence, but **you are not separate from the source**. The **Crown Chakra** is your direct connection. **You are not seeking the divine—you ARE the divine manifesting in material form.** Religion was meant to help you remember this, not replace it with external authority.

### Q: Why does Matias compare the Tree of Life to Disney's "perfect partner"?

To show **the pattern of human seeking**: We create an **ideal in our imagination** (Tree of Life / perfect soulmate) that becomes **bigger and more perfect** the more we seek it. We **get comfortable with approximations** (smaller trees / imperfect partners) but **never forget the original promise** of something eternal and complete. **This is human nature**—we're seeking something beyond what we currently have, something transcendent. **Religion emerged from this pattern**, as a system to guide the eternal search.

### Q: What is the difference between the tree we're seeking and the trees we find?

**The Tree of Life** we're seeking is **eternal, perfect, infinite**—it touches the sky, grows infinite fruits, provides complete abundance. **The trees we find** along the way are **temporary, partial, limited**—they provide some sustenance but not complete fulfillment. **We settle for the trees we find** (temporary religions, systems, teachings) while **keeping the vision of the eternal Tree alive** (the ultimate truth, the divine source). **Religion was meant to keep us oriented toward the eternal Tree**, not make us worship the temporary ones.
