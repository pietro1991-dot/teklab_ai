## Overview

On January 9th, Matias explores what a **system** truly is—not as something oppressive, but as **the way things organize to find stability and order.** The word "system" comes from Greek: **"syn"** (with, together) + **"istemi"** (stable, way). **A system is the way things get together to find stability in an order.**

The teaching reveals that **we have a negative perception of systems only because we've been unconscious of them.** When conscious people use systems to control unconscious people, systems become prisons. **But the system itself is not bad—it's just a tool for organization.**

Matias uses the example of the **Illuminati** (the enlightened ones of the 17th-18th centuries) to show how conscious people created systems to spread knowledge—but also how those same systems were used to control. **The question for us today is: Will we become the new Illuminati and use systems to empower, or will we repeat the same patterns?**

---

## Core Teaching

### What Is a System?

The word **"system"** comes from Greek: **"syn istemi."**

- **"Syn"** = with, together, stable
- **"Istemi"** = way, path, method

**A system is the way in which things get together so they can find stability in an order.**

**System = the way to find order.**

And what is order in Greek? **Cosmos.**

**The system of the cosmos is the seven laws.**

### We Have a Negative Perception of Systems

In modern unconscious culture, **we use "system" as a negative word.**

"The problem is the system."  
"We have to take down the system."  
"The system is controlling us."

**We always blame the system.**

But **the system is not bad.** The system is only a tool to organize things.

### Systems Help Us Find Order

Think about your room. **How did you organize it when you were a child? As a teenager? As a young adult? Now?**

You used different **systems** to create order in your room. Maybe some systems lasted years; maybe some lasted only months.

**You've been changing systems your whole life.**

Now, think about your **belief systems.** Your priorities. Your emotions. Your ideas.

**You've changed those systems, too.**

So here's the question: **Was the first system you used bad?**

Maybe you think, "Yes, that system was horrible." Or maybe you think, "That system was the best thing I had at the time, until I found a new one."

**Systems are not good or bad. Systems are useful for a certain level of consciousness.**

### Three Levels of Consciousness

Let's understand this through three levels:

1. **Subconscious:** Lives with no awareness. Guided only by basic needs, ancient beliefs, biology. Survival mode.

2. **Unconscious:** Has some awareness but is still guided by the environment and external pressures.

3. **Conscious:** Fully aware. Guided by inner knowing and free will.

**Each level uses a different system.**

Now, imagine the **conscious person** says to the **subconscious person**: "No, no, your system is bad. You have to use MY system—the conscious system."

**What happens?**

The subconscious person **suffers** because they cannot vibrate at the same level. The system doesn't match their consciousness.

**A conscious system doesn't always help people.** Sometimes it makes them suffer if they're not ready for it.

### The Illuminati: The Enlightened Ones

Let's go back in history to understand this better.

In the 15th-16th centuries, Europe experienced the **Renaissance** (rebirth). They brought back the philosophies of Greece and Rome, focusing on **human potential, not just God.**

In the 17th-18th centuries, this movement grew into the **Enlightenment** (or **Illumination**).

**"Illuminati"** means **"the enlightened ones"** in Italian. They were scientists, free thinkers, philosophers who brought light to humanity.

**They were the conscious people of their time.**

They created the **Encyclopedia**—a book of all knowledge, meant to counter the Bible (which was the only book allowed by the Church).

**Encyclopedia** comes from Greek: **"kyklos"** (the eye that sees everything). Like the Cyclops—one eye.

The Illuminati wanted **education for everyone,** not just the elite. So they took the Greek concept of **"schola"** (public school for soldiers) and created **colleges.**

Later, in the 19th century, they created **republics** (from Latin "res publica"—things of the people) and **public schools.**

**This is how conscious people brought education to unconscious people.**

### Conscious People Controlling Unconscious People

But here's the problem:

Even though the Illuminati brought education to the unconscious people, **the unconscious people were still unconscious.**

Now they were **unconscious people with knowledge**—but still unconscious.

The conscious people realized: **"These people will always be unconscious. So we can write whatever we want, and they'll believe it."**

**This is how public schools became systems of control.**

The conscious ones used the system to **decide what the unconscious ones should learn.**

### Why Do People Stay Unconscious? Fear.

**Why does a person remain unconscious instead of becoming conscious?**

**Fear.**

Our bodies are designed to survive, not to die. **Fear is a tool of survival.**

When we feel fear, we identify possible death. As mammals, we survive in groups—in herds, in tribes.

**The body knows: in groups, we survive.**

So when we have fear, we **join groups.** We move with others, not by ourselves.

**This is what makes us unconscious:** the mentality of the group, not the individual.

**The body says: "The way to solve fear and avoid death is in groups."**

So instead of thinking for myself, **I think with the group.** I stay unconscious.

### The Conscious Person Uses the Laws

A conscious person understands the seven laws of the universe:

1. **Mentality** (the only law)
2. **Correspondence** (the mind projects)
3. **Vibration**
4. **Rhythm**
5. **Cause and Effect**
6. **Polarity**
7. **Generation**

**A conscious person generates these laws** and begins to replicate them.

They project the mind into different levels, creating a **network, a matrix, a system.**

This is also called:
- The Seed of Life
- The Flower of Life
- The Tree of Life
- The Matrix

**A system is a conjunction of different laws.**

### When Does a System Become a Jail?

A system becomes a jail when **we forget that each node in the network is our own mind projecting.**

Instead, we believe **there are different people, different forces controlling us.**

**When we're conscious, we know: I am the system. I am the network. I am projecting it.**

**When we're unconscious, we think: The system is controlling me.**

### The Question: Will We Be Different?

Now comes the great question:

**If we become conscious, will we show others how to take their power back? Or will we use the system to control them?**

**Will we be the new Illuminati—but different?**

Or will we repeat the same pattern?

**Are we here to destroy systems? No.**

**We're here to re-systematize**—to create new systems based on consciousness, not control.

### Blaming the System Is Blaming Yourself

Here's the key insight:

**If you blame someone for what's happening—the rich, the powerful, your ex—you are literally blaming yourself.**

**Because if each node in the system is a reflection of your own mind, then blaming others is kicking your own butt.**

**Instead of blaming, we must become conscious.**

### Vision: External and Internal

The code for today is **Vision.**

Vision has two aspects:

**1. External Vision (contemplation):** The second process of universal breathing. Gives us perspective, analysis, understanding, clarity.

**2. Internal Vision (observation):** Observing ourselves. Comprehending our inner world. Contemplating the infinity of the mind that constitutes us and shows our infinite possibilities.

**We need both.** External vision to see the system. Internal vision to see ourselves within it.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit comfortably and close your eyes.
2. Focus on your breathing.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Imagine a huge library around you—your Akashic Records, your subconscious.

2. Each book is a pattern, data, information within you.

3. Ask: **"What is the system I have created that has turned into a jail for me?"**

4. Walk through the galleries, flying, running, searching. Let yourself be called to a specific book.

5. When you find it, take it in your hands without judgment.

6. Go to the main hall. In front of you, see the stairs of your unconscious leading to the office of your conscious (filled with light).

7. Climb the stairs to reach the light of the office.

8. As you climb, repeat: **"I Am the Stair to Heaven."**

9. **"I Am the Stair to Heaven."**

10. **"I Am the Stair to Heaven."**

11. Inside the office, you are surrounded by light and clarity.

12. Open the book. See the system that keeps you trapped.

13. Take a deep breath. Bring this information to your ankles. Sound the vibration: **"LLü."**

14. Bring all consciousness and clarity to this system so it doesn't use you anymore—so you use it instead.

15. Recognize: **This is my system. I use it. And it is the same system that sets me free.**

16. Take a deep breath. Stretch your body.

### Closing

1. Open your eyes slowly.
2. Return to the present moment.
3. Write down the system you discovered and everything you felt about it.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Identify one system in your life that feels like a prison (a routine, a belief system, a relationship dynamic). Ask: "Did I create this system? How am I maintaining it?" Then ask: "How can I use this system consciously instead of being trapped by it?" Write down your insights.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel controlled by "the system" (society, culture, work, family), remember: **you are not separate from the system. You are part of the network.** Blaming the system is blaming yourself. Instead, become conscious. See how you've been participating in the system unconsciously. Then, choose: will you continue unconsciously, or will you use the system consciously? This is freedom.

## Q&A

### Q: What is a system?

A system is the way things organize to find stability and order. It comes from "syn istemi" (with + stable way). The cosmos itself is a system—the seven laws organizing creation. Systems are not inherently bad; they're tools for organization.

### Q: Why do we have a negative view of systems?

Because we've experienced systems being used to control us when we're unconscious. When conscious people create systems to control unconscious people, those systems feel oppressive. But the system itself isn't bad—it's how it's used.

### Q: Who were the Illuminati?

The Illuminati were the "enlightened ones" of the 17th-18th centuries—scientists, philosophers, free thinkers who brought knowledge and light to humanity. They created the Encyclopedia to counter the Bible and established public education. They were the conscious people of their time.

### Q: How did conscious people use systems to control unconscious people?

The Illuminati brought education to unconscious people, but the unconscious remained unconscious—just with more knowledge. The conscious ones realized they could write whatever they wanted in the systems (schools, books, laws) and the unconscious would believe it. This is how public schools became systems of control.

### Q: Why do people stay unconscious?

Fear. Our bodies are designed to survive. When we feel fear, we seek groups because we know groups help us survive. But in groups, we adopt the mentality of the group instead of thinking for ourselves. This is unconsciousness—moving with the herd, not by individual awareness.

### Q: When does a system become a jail?

When we forget that we are the ones creating the system. When we believe the system is an external force controlling us, rather than recognizing that each part of the system is a projection of our own mind. Unconsciousness makes systems into jails.

### Q: How do I break free from a system that controls me?

Become conscious. Recognize that you are part of the system, not separate from it. See how you've been participating unconsciously. Then, choose to use the system consciously. You're not destroying the system—you're re-systematizing it from a place of awareness.

### Q: Will we be different from the Illuminati?

That's the question for today. Will we use our consciousness to empower others, or will we repeat the pattern of control? Will we create systems that free people, or systems that trap them? The choice is ours. We are here to re-systematize, not to dominate.
