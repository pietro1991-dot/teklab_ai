## Introduction

Hi everyone. Morning. You got the noon. Good evening.

There 's no why. I do n't know why.

So you went away.

So I 'm just here with the phone internet.

So I do n't know how you will see it. But , well , let 's do whatever we can.

So for sure , you will see me. But today , but the important thing is for you to be able to list me.

So the topic for today is something that concerns us all because the topic is networks.

So the work network , basically the work net. Come from in English comes from the French , which is ne , means clean.

Something that is clean. And this comes from the Latin , near , that means time.

Something that is , that is , that is shiny , that is perfect , that is something that is clear. This concept comes from the origin of the words , nets or nexus , near , that means to whip something , to whip something.

So we can connect different parts that are separated.

So basically it 's like a like creating a tissue. This , this creation of three , of this , of these tissues for clothes and these kind of things. Eventually in history , this concept of creating something that is all connected , that is so needed , came to describe something that is very , how to say fancy and fashion and shiny.

So that 's why the same concept that is about connecting things , was awarded , related to something that is clean and clear.

So for a long time , the word net was used in , in English , something , something like that , something which is clean. And eventually , in history , the people start to use the word net to describe something that was very organized , that is like very clear , like a pattern of railways or roads , or whatever these kind of things.

Something that was very clear and understandable , and net. And that 's how it became a synonym of a connection between different things that are there well organized.

So just a little bit of the history of the words , so we can understand from where it comes from and why we use them.

So of course that then in this world , we have another word which is web , which is web , it 's not describing exactly the net. This is describing like the spider web , which is a tissue of organic tissue that we imitated to describe what is a network. Bueno , que do n't say es la hora del rest , si hay un tico change se guide ir a chuchar del rest. Sinceó vez es al día.

If you can hear that 's the praying , it 's five times a day , so it became , now it 's the time.

So eventually , the concept of net and the beginning of history was only related to tissues , to things that you have weaver , like clothes. But then we started to use this words to describe other kind of tissues , like the organisms , the muscles , the connection with other populations , and the way that we 're talking about is that we 're talking about the same structure of different notes connecting to shape something bigger , we start to use this concept for that.

So it 's spread the idea of networks. The concept that we have today about networks has started mainly when a few years ago , a few decades ago , the trends started to work around the world. When the railways were spread in different countries , the stations were the trends with top. It became like kind of notes in a network that would cater to the different individuals , the different people that were in different villages.

So people started to get connected in this course of trends , and also information and products also started to be connected along the world. And this connection allowed also the information to come to every corner of the world to notify everyone about males. This communication of the trends that created networks helped people to create like this subsco-insidea of being connected of networks of people. This communication of networks created an organic idea of a relationship.

So it started to create many networks and changed the point of view of people that we communicated in an organic way and not only in a pyramidal way.

So it helped many networks new networks to appear in reality.

So basically this idea of networks that were created helps us to understand that many new ways in which individuals can communicate and connect to one another along the world without the need of somebody 's in the middle.

So this made that in the 40s and the 50s , we started to look for means of communication to one another that could be much more flexible. But because we already had the radio , To , most cords , most more code. But all of them were controlled by one entity so it was not from people to people.

So around the 60s , they managed to create something new which was a net that allows us to communicate sharing data from one point to another using different communications from in distance to exchange data.

So exchange data is what we say , so that 's why we call it internet. Internet is basically the interactive communication in kind of an order. This makes that many people start to use this kind of communication and it evolved until what we have today since the 70s and 80s creating the internet that we know today. But let 's go into the philosophical aspect that brought the function of networks.

The main philosophical concept that we got from the networks is that we were able now to see how nature works in networks not in a pyramidal way.

So something important to see here is how we started to change the concept of nature and reality. Like for example , we started to understand that in nature , there is no kingdoms. That there are no borders.

So we started to understand that in nature , there is no kingdoms. That there are networks of things.

So it maybe seems very silly when I would say , but it 's the key of everything. When we started to see the networks around us , science , spirituality , called everyone started to see the world as networks instead of kingdoms , instead of hierarchies. But so our brain was used for thousands of years to see the reality divided in kingdoms , countries , nations , and empires.

So we started to call everything as kingdoms , the kingdom of minerals , the animal kingdom , the digital kingdom , the human kingdom , and the kingdom of the heavens , the kingdom of God. And we started to name all that as kingdoms. And of course , when we think in our families , also was organized as a kingdom with that on the top , mom , under eight , and then the key.

So as we see the entire society organized in a hierarchy , because everything that we have around was the hierarchy. Until suddenly , we started to see the networks.

## Energy Work

So science started to see how the trees does n't have a kingdom , they work with the roots , and they connect , they work with the network , they see animals migrating in networks , they see the ways of the ocean and currents that are also network. We started to see networks in nature and also in ourselves. There was no kingdoms anymore. It is all about networks.

I was saying in Spanish that , have you ever been looking into a , like , Turkey painting , and you ca n't understand what it is , until someone comes and says , there 's a cat there , and you suddenly see the cat. What happens like this? Because your reign can see something until someone or something around , can tell you or point about that thing that it was hidden.

So suddenly , you saw it. This is what was happening.

So as you can see , it works , we 're , we 're always there all the time. But until we did n't experience what is to be in a network , we can see the networks around.

So suddenly , a lot of people is waking up saying , if we work in networks right now , why do we need hierarchy? Why do we need precedence and keen or queens and , or this kind of leaders in the world , if we have the networks?

## Q&A

So we have to tune ourselves. That 's the question. And the proper answer to that question would be that , even if you have the tool , it means that you know how to use the tool. That 's why we have still the old systems.

So not understanding how it works , it would be like this example. Imagine you want to take a trip to the other side of the planet and you say , I want to fly there and someone says , well , here is another plane.

So you can use the airplane. Would you know how to fly an airplane? Just like that? No.

Even if you have the tool , which is the airplane to fly to the other side , it does n't mean that you know how to fly it.

So you have to learn many things. You have to learn so many things in order to know how to fly an airplane that , even if you have the tool , you wo n't be able to do it.

So this is exactly what is happening with us right now. We have the internet , which is like the airplane , but we have no idea how to use it. We do n't know how to fly with it. Basically , we are a kid , a five-years-old , that we are playing with a toy with a tool that we just discovered.

We were able to do. Like , we put three or four things together , and we created something new , and we are just discovering what it is. But we are still playing. We 're able to do it.

We 're able to do it. We 're able to do it. But we are still playing. We today have a tool of the 21st century , but we still leave our lives like , if we are in the middle ages , 1500 years ago.

So this is not about whether I like or not the old system. It 's about if I am capable of let that system go for myself , go away from myself , and to adapt and to understand how it works the new one.

So if today we eliminate the old system to create a new one , it will be a crisis. Because we would have not the tools to understand how it works.

So this is why we need so much inner healing. This is why we need to work with ourselves to clean our history , to acknowledge our trauma , to face our conflicts. We have to make the peace with our history , with everything that we carry within.

So this is why we are doing this. In this past 300 days , we have been learning about the world , changing our points of view , trying to understand the reality we live in , trying to connect with ourselves to understand who we are. It 's the process of education. This is a process for a whole life.

What we have been living as a humanity , humanity has been in this planet only for 300,000 years , only 300,000 years. And in that period of time , we have been doing all what we have done , where we have created as a humanity. And it 's nothing compared to the history of the planet. We are still learning.

It 's a constant process of learning , and we are still kids. We are still child for the planet. This is the important thing for us to realize. That we are not something from the outside of the planet , that came and we are living in this world.

We have been evolving in this planet from thousands and millions of years , so we are part of this. It 's not that is the planet and us , and we are hurting the planet. It 's a planet hurting itself. It 's us.

We are the planet too.

So we are whatever we are doing to the world , is a world doing it to itself. And it 's important to understand this , because we are just the tiny part of the process of the awakening of this planet. And to have the whole picture , if you can take the history of the planet as , if we can take the history of the planet as a whole year , like a whole calendar , humanity has been in this planet for us two hours of the last day. Two hours , these 300,000 years is only two hours of the last day.

And in the last minute of , only one minute has been the last 200 years. And everything that we are doing now.

So basically we are kids just a baby that took some painting and started to paint the walls of the house , because they do not know where to paint , they do not know how to use the paper.

So this baby started to paint everything , the bed , the walls and everything , doing a mess. That 's what is happening. This is just a tiny part of the process that the earth is in its own awakening. This is covering a new way of understanding itself.

So this is what is important to get from this is that can complain and criticize everything that humanity can do. And the evil evil of humanity and all these kind of things. And we can complain of all that , but suddenly if we want to be aware and conscious of this , take a deep and go beyond and go farther and see the history of humanity. And you will see area above that is just this.

It is just two , three baby steps in entire history. And like a baby , it can cry , it can make noise , it can grab the hair and try to pull it.

So we are just a baby plain. And suddenly someone , can ask more from this baby. The last iPhone on the market. And the baby suddenly has networks.

So until this moment when the baby got the iPhone , the baby knew only two images , slide , mum and dad , that the heaven , mum , the earth. And we had only these two options. And we had only these two options. And we had only these two options.

And we had only these two options. And we were like in love with these two options. Like I want to be like my dad , the skies. I want to be protected by my mom , the earth.

And that was the vision like with mom and dad. And suddenly the baby got the iPhone and opened it. And inside , if this cover many options of mom and dad , so many ways to understand mom and dad that suddenly it starts to ask of , where mom and dad really real did that exist at the first point. Or what is mom and dad?

Maybe it 's not what I believe. Maybe it 's a different way.

So thanks to the networks , suddenly it starts to see the reality in a very different way , in which it 's not anymore like before , like mom and dad , good and bad. It changed.

So when we start to become aware , conscious , the point of view is very different.

Sometimes we believe that we are aware that we are conscious , but we are not. Because to be conscious is to. Good night that we are not superior. By being conscious.

Being conscious is to recognize that we are just in the process of learning. And we can not judge.

Someone that is learning from a very short period of time that. We have been doing this for a very short period of time. When we start to change our point of view , we have to think that. Plants we can say plans work perfectly and we are there.

So amazing what can we work like them. Well , trees. They are perfect for the world because they have been here. Since around 200 million years.

They have evolved for millions of years.

So they know how the planet works. They know how it works. 60 million 65 million years ago. Names started to roll the planet.

Three million years ago. Only three million years ago. It 's the role of the world. Like us.

Three million years ago. Three hundred thousand years ago. Humanity. Start to exist.

Ten thousand years ago. The first civilizations. And just 50 years ago. Internet.

So this is why we can not work as a perfect society as the trace work. Because it 's been only 50 years. Then we have been learning how. How a network works.

## Energy Work

Looking in our roots. Going to the past. Understanding the roots. Understanding branches.

Learning does that happen. That new world. It 's true that we 've lived without expecting anything. It 's been very short.

But of time. In which a huge amount of people started to realize about this things.

So this is why I do n't like to say that there is an evil and a good. I would like to say that.

So just parentheses , I 'm not saying with this that I do n't believe that there are evil creatures in different dimensions and all these kind of things and aliens and so on. No , I 'm just saying that we have to be responsible for what is our part in this evolution.

So in the next 2000 years we will be connecting to what we call the networks. We will be living what a network is and it also will allow us to connect to other beings in different dimensions , different worlds that leave right now the idea of networks. But the only way we will accomplish that is if we as a whole humanity manage to leave the idea of hierarchies. And one other important thing here is that in 2,500 years each of Capricorn will begin.

And for sure , we 'll be very different.

So we will have to live behind the ideas of Aquarium. Why we have in front is not the age of the great truth of humanity and all these kind of things that we can think about. It 's just another process. It 's not about the age of consciousness is about the age of networks.

Along the next 2000 years we will understand the whole universe through the concept of networks , but maybe in Capricorn we will have a very different way to understand the universe. What we are doing here is basically to work for the reconstruction of the conscious network. The networks of consciousness which is to help us to rebuild the idea that there is no need for hierarchy that all are doing something important. And we have to be all connected.

## Q&A

So we have to task in our time regarding networks. The first one is of the Recollection of the planetary network. The planetary network is to reconnect the idea of the secret spots of the planet where the information is received and that 's what we are doing , traveling to the nose. And in the other hand , the reconstruction of the awareness of the network of consciousness would be to help us discern our inner power and to know how to focus ourselves inside.

So basically what we are doing with the Recollection of networks is to understand that the nodes of the planet are spots where we can receive information. And as we can connect the different tissues of the reality , the different networks of the reality of this world as a whole pattern of information. We can also access to that information to become aware and know how to manage to create a new reality for a new memory.

So this , this days I have been , I 've seen a comment that told me that it 's pretty what I 've explained that because it 's all philosophical and beautiful and whatever , but it 's not useful. It 's like , what is the practical part of all this? Like you 're not doing anything. You 're not doing nothing for humanity because you 're just talking.

And I will answer to that. I have been 325 days sharing every day concepts to help people to understand the questions that they have in order for them to start to do what they are supposed to do.

So I would like to clarify this , the time of Savior has ended is Shane.

So my part is to share. Because we are networks in the network time is the work of each one of you to know what you 're going to do with this. What is your part in all of this? Because I 'm not going to do that.

Everyone has something to do.

So just wanted to clarify this concept.

So it 's important to understand that in the time of networks , nobody will come to do everything for the others. In the time of networks , everyone has to do what they know how to do. And what I guess that I know how to explain.

So that 's why I explain. This is time of networks.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's work with ourselves networks. The vibration for today is cute. The statement today is I am Polaris Product. The code today is one of the Atlantic families named Codes.

In honor of one of the 12 guards of the doors of the world , we pronounce their name , Codes.

So it 's comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing. I take a deep breath. It 's coming out where my entire physical body. I pair tensions with my feet from two to my head.

I start to move softly every joint. I move the ankle , knee , hip , entire spine. Fingers , waist , pulse and shoulders. Mix and the jaw.

I start to yarn. I say stretch body. This soft movement , I try to recognize each part of my body. I allow myself to carry a touch each part of my body to recognize that I am the conjunction of networks.

The networks of my body , of my soul and my spirit , started by the thought. In my skin , bones , muscles , nerve systems , therapist and I can feel as I touch the body. I recognize all these networks inside. I also recognize the networks of emotions from the hormones , out of the breath.

The links , the bones that we have with feelings , and also in the spiritual level , the magnetic field , all around. I can feel the information in this network. That goes all through me. My young , that 's.

. . I touch and carries the physical emotional mental , recognize myself and network of networks. I can feel the physical emotional mental , recognize myself and network of people.

I can feel the physical emotional mental , recognize myself and network of people. I can feel the physical emotional mental , recognize myself and network of consciousness. I am the network of consciousness. I recognize that I am the product of all of the.

. . I have been weaver along the past. Every animal , every being , and every subject , you may free of life in my family tree.

I have been weed in , well , but I am right now. This is how I can recognize myself as the result of a note , an axis , and a line. I am the daughter of a polarity. The father and the mother , the pattern on the matrix.

I am the father of all of the people. I am the polarity. I am the father of all of the people. I am the father of all of the people.

And my existence. I am the father of all of the people. I am the father of all of the people. I am the father of all of the people.

I am the father of all of the people. I think I think I think I am the network of consciousness. I am the net of networks. Take a deep breath and stretch in your body each one of your tongue time.

I am the father of all of the people. Thank you everybody for being here another day. See you tomorrow. I will always be at the same time.
