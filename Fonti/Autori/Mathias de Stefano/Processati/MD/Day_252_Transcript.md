## Overview

Today we explore **intention**—not just as a spiritual concept, but as a precise mechanism of how consciousness creates reality.

Most importantly, we'll distinguish between two similar but different words:
- **Intension** (with an 's')
- **Intention** (with a 't')

Understanding this difference reveals the mechanics of manifestation.

---

## Etymology of Intention

### Intention (with 't')

**In + Tension + Action**

- **In** = within
- **Tension** = the force that allows extension
- **Action** = the movement that manifests

**Intention** means: **to take action on what I have within to manifest outside**.

It's the **extension** of what's inside to the outside world.

### Intension (with 's')

**In + Extension**

- **In** = within
- **Extension** = the totality of what something contains

**Intension** (with an 's') means: **what is contained within**, the full scope of inner potential.

---

## The Difference Between Intension and Intention

### Intension: What You Hold Within

Imagine the vegetable kingdom. Its **intension** (with 's') is **everything that the vegetable kingdom is**: all plants, all seeds, all possibilities of plant life.

### Intention: The Action of Manifesting One Possibility

But if the vegetable kingdom wants to **manifest** something specific, it needs **intention** (with 't'): **photosynthesis**.

Photosynthesis is the **action** that extends the inner nature (intension) into outer reality (plants growing, oxygen produced, life sustained).

### Example in Human Terms

- **Intension**: All your potential, all you could be, your essence
- **Intention**: The specific action you take to manifest one aspect of that potential

You might have the intension to be loving, creative, and wise. But if you want to **manifest** that in reality, you need the **intention**—the actual extension of that inner quality into action.

---

## Tension is Not Negative

### Redefining Tension

We've been taught that **tension** is bad—something to release, eliminate, avoid.

But etymologically:
- **Tension** comes from **tender** (to stretch, to extend)
- **Census** (as in "comprehensive") comes from the same root: **to extend**

**Tension is the capacity to extend.**

Think of a guitar string. The string must have **tension** to create sound. Without tension, no music. The tension allows the string to **vibrate** and extend its energy as sound waves.

### Pressure vs. Tension

**Pressure** is the opposite of tension.

- **Tension** = the force that extends, stretches, allows movement
- **Pressure** = compression, pushing inward, restricting

When you have too much **pressure** in your chakras, you can't extend your energy. You need **tension**—the right amount of force that allows extension.

---

## The Chakras as Strings

### Tuning Your Instrument

The chakras are like strings on an instrument. Each one needs the right amount of **tension** to vibrate properly.

If there's too much **pressure** (compression), the energy can't flow.

If there's the right **tension** (extension capacity), the energy flows beautifully, creating coherence between:
- Body (physical reality)
- Soul (emotional/energetic reality)
- Spirit (consciousness)

### Setting Intention in Each Chakra

To manifest anything, you must set the **intention** in each chakra—extending the inner desire through all levels of your being.

If you only set intention in your mind (third eye) but not in your heart, sacral, or root, nothing manifests. The intention must be coherent through all chakras.

---

## Manifestation Requires Inner Change

### The Key Principle

**If I don't do any change within, nothing will happen to change outside.**

Many people set intentions: "I want abundance, I want love, I want health."

But they don't change anything **within**. They keep the same thoughts, same emotions, same actions. And they wonder why nothing manifests.

**Intention is not wishing. Intention is extending what you've transformed within into outer reality.**

### The Process

1. **Intension**: Recognize what you hold within (your full potential)
2. **Inner Transformation**: Change thoughts, emotions, beliefs
3. **Intention**: Extend that new inner reality outward through action
4. **Manifestation**: Outer reality reflects inner transformation

---

## Free Will and Inner Nature

### The Confusion

People confuse **free will** with **intension**.

- **Intension** = your inner nature, your essence (what you are)
- **Free will** = your capacity to choose how to extend that nature (what you do)

You cannot change your **intension** (essence). A tree cannot decide to be a rock.

But you have **free will** to choose how you **extend** that essence—which aspects you manifest, how you express them.

### Example

Your intension might include being creative, analytical, and compassionate. You can't change that you have these qualities.

But your **free will** chooses:
- Do I extend creativity through art or problem-solving?
- Do I extend compassion to all beings or just my family?
- Do I extend my analytical nature to science or philosophy?

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Become aware of your breath, your body, your presence.

### Third Eye Activation

Visualize a light in front of you—your soul as divine spark.

Bring this light to your **third eye**.

### Setting Intention

Feel all the **intension** within you—all you could be, all possibilities.

Now, set the **intention** to extend one aspect of this inner potential into your outer reality.

**What do you want to manifest from within to without?**

### Sound Practice

Sound: **Rai**

**I am conscious wisdom. I am conscious wisdom. I am conscious wisdom.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Crown

Bring the intention up to your **crown**.

Set intention to manifest **a new idea of yourself** in the world.

Extend this from within to without.

### Throat

Bring intention to your **throat**.

Set intention to manifest **a new truth**, a new way of speaking your reality.

Extend this from within to without.

### Heart

Bring intention to your **heart**.

Set intention to manifest **a new way of loving**, of feeling, of connecting.

Extend this from within to without.

### Solar Plexus

Bring intention to your **solar plexus**.

Set intention to manifest **a new way of being**, a new identity in the world.

Extend this from within to without.

### Sacral

Bring intention to your **sacral chakra**.

Set intention to manifest **a new creation**, new projects, new life.

Extend this from within to without.

### Root

Bring intention to your **root**.

Set intention to manifest **a new reality**, grounding your vision.

Extend this from within to without.

### Knees and Ankles

Bring intention down to your **knees and ankles**.

Set intention to manifest **a new path**, new steps in the world.

Extend this from within to without.

### Integration

Feel the **coherence** now between:
- What you hold within (intension)
- What you extend outward (intention)
- The reality manifesting (creation)

All are aligned. All are one movement.

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Stretch. Yawn. Return to here and now at your own time.

## Key Insights

- **Intension** (s) = what you hold within, your full potential and essence.
- **Intention** (t) = the action of extending what's within to manifest outside.
- Tension is not negative—it's the capacity to extend, like a guitar string that must be tensed to create sound.
- Pressure (compression) is the opposite of tension (extension).
- Chakras are like strings that need proper tension to vibrate and allow energy flow.
- Manifestation requires **inner transformation first**—if nothing changes within, nothing changes outside.
- Free will is not about changing your essence (intension) but choosing how to extend it (intention).
- Coherence between body, soul, and spirit is essential for manifestation.
- Census and tender (etymological roots) both mean "to extend."
- Setting intention in all chakras (not just the mind) creates coherent manifestation.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Before setting any intention today, ask:

"What have I changed **within** that I now want to extend **outside**?"

If the answer is "nothing," then you're not setting intention—you're wishing.

### The Coherence Check

When you want to manifest something, scan through your chakras:

- Crown: Do I truly believe in this idea?
- Third Eye: Do I think about it clearly?
- Throat: Can I speak this truth?
- Heart: Do I feel aligned with it?
- Solar Plexus: Does this match who I am?
- Sacral: Am I creating actions for it?
- Root: Am I grounding it in reality?

If any chakra says "no," there's incoherence. Work on that chakra first.

### Tension as Tool

Notice where you feel **tension** in your body today.

Instead of trying to eliminate it, ask: "What is this tension trying to extend? What energy wants to move through here?"

Then allow it to extend rather than compress it.

## Week Context

Aries Emotional Week - Wisdom Theme:

- Day 1 (Crown): Answer - spiritual wisdom
- **Day 2 (Third Eye): Intention - conscious wisdom**
- Days 3-10 continuing...

We're learning to work with Aries energy—the force of initiation and manifestation. Intention is the mechanism by which inner transformation becomes outer reality.

## Q&A

### Q: So "intension" with an 's' is not a spelling mistake?

Correct. It's a different word with a different meaning. Intension = what's within. Intention = extending it outside.

### Q: How can I tell if I have pressure or healthy tension in my chakras?

Pressure feels like constriction, tightness, inability to move. Healthy tension feels like aliveness, readiness, potential about to spring into action.

### Q: If I set intention but nothing manifests, what's wrong?

Either you haven't transformed anything within (so there's nothing new to extend), or you're only setting intention in one chakra (usually the mind) but not coherently through all of them.

### Q: Can I change my intension (essence)?

No. You cannot change what you fundamentally are. But you have infinite freedom in how you express it, which aspects you develop, how you extend it.

### Q: What's the relationship between yesterday's "Answer" and today's "Intention"?

The answer gives you new wisdom/knowledge. That knowledge changes something within you. Intention is the action of extending that new inner reality outward. They're sequential steps in manifestation.

### Q: Why do we need tension? Can't we just flow without any force?

Flow requires movement. Movement requires energy. Energy requires the capacity to extend. That capacity is tension. A river needs banks (tension) to flow—without them, it's just a puddle.

### Q: How does this relate to the emotional theme of Aries week?

Aries energy is about taking action, pushing forward, initiating. Intention is the controlled, conscious use of that forward force. This week teaches you how to use intense energy (including anger) intentionally rather than just reactively.
