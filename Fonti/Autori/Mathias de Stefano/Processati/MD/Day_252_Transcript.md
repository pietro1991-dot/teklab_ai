## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So the topic for today is intention.

So let 's talk about what intention means. Talking about the technology , I think that I wanted to say is how important is to learn how the language is. Because as you have seen all these days , when we speak about about the technology , usually we go to the same origin. The words means exactly the same in the origin , in Greek , in Latin , in the European languages.

Whenever we go , they have the same meaning.

So it helps us to understand the different meanings. And also a good thing about this is that when we start to learn these languages , we can also understand how languages are not only , I think , to communicate is something that designs the way we think. The way we think , that designs the way we feel , the cultures , our beliefs , our way of doing the things that morals , the ethics of a person.

So it 's really important to understand that when you learn or you open yourself to understand and you language , you can also open your brain to new possibilities. Yes , that 's a good way to understand also why we are using both languages.

So as you see intention and intention come from the same origin , meaning in , then source and teo.

So intention , the meaning come from in that means inside within , then source , that means to extend to expand something and teo , that means action.

So extension is the action of extend something that is within inside.

So that 's how we can understand this word.

So now in our cultures today , when we say , I intend to do this or I said the intention , I manifest the intention of something. When we are usually doing is mistaken intention with hope or the wait for it. Because we are waiting for something to happen and kind of we mistake this intention with the hope of something to happen in the future. We say , I manifest intention like if I said all my energy for that to happen in the future.

And this is because of this many centuries bringing this information to us according to the hope of things in a religious way.

So now when we spiritually talking , we manifest intention , we mistake that with the preconcept that we have about hope. But as you see , intention comes from extends something that is within into the outside.

So it 's not exactly related with the concept that we have today about what intention is. But for sure , I do n't know if everyone was thinking like I was thinking too , but maybe we have this mistaken , this mistaken concept that when we said intention we are waiting for something outside , when it really is trying to tell us that in order to manifest something outside , we have to take what is within into the outside.

So that 's the word intention to bring what is within into the outside.

So when we usually put the intention , set the intention and something and we want to do something new and we manifest the intention of something. For sure , what happens later is that we start to leave the things that we do n't want exactly to leave. Because before that thing starts to manifest , we have to take all what is inside into the outside.

So what starts to happen is that we start to leave at moment that we do n't really like that is a bit weird in which we start to manifest what we had inside and we did n't want to see.

So this brings us to the technology of the word , census.

Okay. What is census? Census is to extend.

So we will have also the word tender from here.

So the tender something that extends. Stretch. That allows the movement. This is the word that will give origin to the word tension.

Tension. We usually relate the word tension with someone or something that is under tension.

So we have a lot of tension in our life or in situations as a situation is really tense or this kind of things.

So we relate the word tension with being under pressure with being with staying tense in front of us situation or something like this.

So when we leave the negative aspect of the word tension in our cultures today and we just go to the etymology , we will see that tension means. How much something can be extend expand. That would be.

So now let 's see the difference. We have pressure. And tension. Pressure and tension.

Is the opposite.

So pressure is. To be compressed. And pressure is to extend as much as possible.

So the concept of why tension is something negative for us is because we used this word to describe. A situation in which you have to speak in between to opposite options like to different things that are pushing me pulling me one to each side and they kind of are about to break me.

So I break down. I break if this two things are pulling me away.

So as I said , tension is the ability or the capacity of something to extend to expand.

So here we have two different concepts. One is the intention. And the other one is the intention. The sound equal.

So this one here intention is written with t in English. Intention is written with t because it has this etymology inside. The t. That means action.

So this word here is the action. The action of extend something that is inside.

So this is I will one here. Does n't have the word action. It 's not talking about an action itself. It 's talking about how the shape , the form , the way in which something is being done.

So we have this one here that is describing the action of extension. And this one other here that is describing how it is extending is the stage in which this thing finds itself. This is speaking about the stage of something. This is speaking about the action of something.

So now. When you have the intention of something , this means that you are willing to do something. Is it is talking about what are you going to do? What action are you going to take?

In the future. And this one here intention. This one here is the one that is saying explaining about how I have a feeling. I find myself now in which state I am right now.

They sound the same , but this one is talking about how I find myself now. And this one here is talking about what are my actions. What are the actions that I 'm going to take in the future.

So what is describing intention? Is describing the extension that. That something that an object. Can hold within.

So as a simple example of the difference between intention and intention.

So in English they sound. The same , but intention with S. Is for example. What is the intention?

The intention of the vegetable kingdom. The intention of the vegetable kingdom goes throughout all the plants. Which means different trees , pines , algae , all that.

So grass , that 's the intention that accumulates the idea of. The idea of the vegetable kingdom. And intention with tea is what is the intention of the vegetable kingdom. What is the intention of the vegetable kingdom is.

To do the photosynthesis. To create their food.

So the intention with tea. What is the action of the vegetable kingdom to do. The photosynthesis.

So for a human for example. The intention with S is describing. For example me. What am I?

The intention of what am I is I am a human. I am a. And also for example , I am a second. But then I have.

I have a value system. I have the leaves. I have. Certain emotions.

I have certain actions and attitudes.

Okay.

So those things that measure what I am. Free will.

So goals , the sirens , wishes , all the things that they want to do in the future , to create , to manifest in the future , that 's the intention with tea.

Now , to understand this , intention with S is describing what am I inside? What do I have within?

So all the aspects that makes me be Human. Who am?

Sorry.

So that 's the intention. It 's describing what is inside. What makes me be? And intention with tea is the one that tells me what I 'm going to push from the inside to the outside.

So whatever I had within my intention will be intent to the outside. By intention with tea.

So this means that everything that we expect to happen outside depends on what do we have within.

So this means that anything that is going to be outside can be by magic. Everything that 's going to happen outside happens because I changed it within.

## Q&A

So now you might ask me , but that 's obvious. That 's what you 're saying is obvious. If I do n't do something , nothing will happen outside. And I would say yes , that 's like this.

That 's obvious. But we have been living this magical world expecting for things to happen just like magic. And it 's not like this. Intention means to take action of what I have within to manifest the outside.

It 's like this simple. What it means is that if I do n't do any change within , nothing will happen to change outside.

So this means that for more than I put the intention to do something outside for something to happen outside , it wo n't happen if I did n't change within.

So it 's not about hope. It 's about responsibility.

So let 's go to what do we have inside within which is that 's intention with S.

So what do we have within? Let 's remember about the word tension. But not the tension that we usually say. Detention , meaning the extension of a human being.

Extension. When we speak about extension , it means through where it extend a human being.

So they have the same etymology.

So extension means to go out the the expansion of something. That would be.

So for example , we have the extension in a human being can be extended in a physical way , thinking in count the biology , the cells , the molecules. And then the molecules has an extension of magnetism which is the energy.

So they have also an extension of energy , the energy moves waves in the space , magnetic waves.

So that creates the vibration.

So we have also an extension in vibration as a human being.

So what we speak about extension is how much it can expand one only human being. From the physical , emotional , the the energy to the electrical and the vibrational. That 's extension until where a being can expand.

So what is intention? The intention is what is within that extension of the being. Until this being disappears as a being , what it has within inside.

So we will simplify here this concept of the human. Here we have a human with a physical aspect and an energy to go aspect and the vibrational aspect.

So we can call the physical aspect the body. We can call the energy to go aspect as the charts and we can call the vibrational aspect as the Kundalini , the wave.

So these are the three aspects in which we can describe the intention of a being.

So the intention will describe in which aspect my physical body finds itself my soul , the energy to go body finds itself and my vibration , the spirit finds itself.

Okay.

So this means that the physical aspect , the energy to go aspect and the vibrational aspect are constantly in attention.

So what this means is that the physical , the energy to go and the vibrational are always in attention. That means that are stretched , that are extended in the body.

So if one of these centers of energy or one of these vibrations are not coherent in between one another , they do n't follow the same pattern they are in coherent. That 's the moment when we start to fill the tension.

So this means that we are constantly in tension , all the time in tension , but we can not notice that tension unless some of these aspects are in coherent or unbalanced with the other ones.

So in order to correct that that unbalanced , we have to identify the tension. This is like if each one of these checklist is accord. Here we have other courts.

So imagine that each one of these checklist is connected with a court and this way it 's too.

So when you are playing the courts of the checklist , all of them will be in tension because without tension you can not note can not sound.

So it 's like they 're good. But what happened with you , do you know now that there is one that is not in the right tension that you need to tune in order for you to sound properly?

So as you see , the problem is not to fill the tension. The problem is that we are not rightly tuned in the right tension. And if we do n't allow ourselves to just relax and to listen to where is the problem , we are not going to be able to understand where is the problem of tension.

So now with this we can understand the next , which is the in tension.

So what is the place of in tension here? Well first you have to remember that each one of these checklist is tuned in a certain level of vibration that goes out and manifest or call in the outside the things that are in the inside.

So they are calling the same things in the same to the same harmony that we are and that 's how we manifest in the outside.

So now what is the role of in tension here that whatever you intend from one chara will be projected in the outside.

So if we do n't change or understand the problem of this chara , if you do n't tune and harmonize this chara , everything that comes with the intention in the outside will be referred to the same vibration in which this chara finds itself. This is why when we intend something , we have to know which tension we have.

So now to the question , how can I understand if I am in tension or if I have any problem with this tension? Well here is your job because of course what we have in our daily life is our conflicts , our struggles with the relationship with someone , the conflicts that we have in our daily life , those are the shows , the things that shows us where we have the tension. And from there you have many different professionals that for sure can help you by from psychologists , the qualification , therapies in many areas that can help you to figure out where do you have the problem , where do you have the tension?

So to the how can we do it , is the same as how can I understand it? Each person is unique , each person has their own ways to figure out this because each person has a different vibration and different energy , totally completely different.

So I can say like a manual to handbook that says , this is how you do it. But of course that the main thing to understand is that you have to be coherent , we must be coherent to understand where we have the problem or how to solve it. For example myself , myself , this days I was incoherent these days with myself , I was n't coherent myself. That 's why everything started to work wrong and everything created problems and it was not feeling good.

So so it 's about to learn how to listen to yourself basically.

## Guided Meditation

So for some people to tune this , is to change the food for others to go to yoga , for others to the meditation , for others to go to the therapist.

So find your own.

So today in the alignment we are going to set the intention , manifest the intention that we have in each one of the chapters.
