## Introduction

She watched 3 million movies series. Thank you. Thank you! I take it to breath.

I become aware of my entire body. Bringing all my attention to my feet. Stars into go up to the head. Moving slowly and softly.

Every joint for my toes. Going through the ankles. Knees. Deep.

Then , the entire spine. Fingers. Race. That 'll both shoulders , neck and jaw.

Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

There is low dms. I start to stretch and move the entire body. It 's part of it. A side , John.

I take him on and to feel. See the sensations of each extreme of my body within and outside. I start to carry my face. Each one of the senses.

I head to my feet. I carry all the body. I try to remember since I was very young. What are the things that I really change in my life?

What where my biggest innovations in life? I remember all the innovations that I have in me. I recognize in these memories that I have the capacity to transform myself. The ability to do something different in you.

I start to think about all those things that I change. But I do n't dare to change. I recognize that I have the ability to innovate and then to start to imagine that I am doing that. Transitence needs to my entire physical body that I can.

I really can innovate in my life. I have the ability to develop my own body. I have the ability to develop my own body. I have the ability to develop my own body.

I have the ability to develop my own body. I have the ability to develop my own body. I have the ability to develop my own body. I take it with us and relax the body.

I acknowledge that I am able to relax for I am really in the process of innovation , generating my new reality. I recognize that I am a product of all those innovations and I am able to generate new ones , processing the tools to me. I am a product of generation. I am a product of generation.

I am a product of generation. I am a product of generation. I am a product of generation. I am a product of generation.

I am a product of generation. I am innovation. I am a product of generation. I take it with me and start to move and stretch the body very softly.

I am a product of generation. Thank you for being another day here.
