## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening , wherever you are. Of course , I have to thank also to those people that are tomorrow , that are in the day of tomorrow. As I know that there are some people that are far away and many hours ahead that are following the everyday. And even if you are ahead of us , you are doing everything one day late , everything that we do.

So , so thank you for being every day connected from those countries in the part of the world , in the in the Pacific and the in the ocean.

So let 's go to the topic for today , which is something that touches all not only humans but also every living being in any planet which is wealth.

So let 's talk about the topic from our point of view in human and of course from the systematic point of view.

So first of all , before we speak about these kind of things , for sure I know that many of you are very position in a political way or political position or an economic position , your point of view.

## Q&A

So I respect that but I will recommend you to before your ideologies into question , just pay attention to the neutral point of view of this , okay , before we say anything from our vision.

So , and I want to clarify this before I speak about these issues because sometimes maybe you can perceive that I have some point of view that maybe are similar to the right. And sometimes more to the left.

So I want to say this that I do n't have any idea of politics or economics , I do n't care about those things. I consider myself a humanist , so I do n't care about right or left and those kind of things.

So I do n't really care about that. The only thing that I say about right and left is that they are the seats that the all guys took in the British parliament many time ago.

So that 's it.

So we are going to see it from the neutral point of view. And also important to know that in this kind of topics is not necessarily that we all. I believe the same or thing the same. It 's also even much more important that many of us can have different.

Different point of view , okay , so the. The important thing here is that when we are. When we have this different point of view , we can help each other to remember us. How to come back to the center , okay , so that 's why it 's important to have many points of views.

In order to evolve , you know , to grow otherwise this would be a dictatorship. Which is not what we want.

So as I said in areas , in the month of areas. When I say we should have many points of views , the main thing is that we can share point of views to improve. But not to insult the other or to believe that we are better or discuss , okay.

So , I think that 's the first thing that we can do is to be able to have enough things.

So respect , main thing from the point of views , diversity is respect.

So let 's talk about wealth. What is wealth for us?

So what is wealth from our human point of view?

So what is wealth for us?

So what is wealth for us?

So what is wealth for us? All that we have.

So I can consider myself rich.

So why I say to be rich just by these three needs? By having these three needs secure. Because to be rich , basically means to be able to govern yourself , to administrated yourself , to be sure of what you have and be able to survive by that.

So that what can make you consider rich because you administrated your own things. When someone is not rich , someone start being rich when the three main things depends on someone else to give you the things that you need. That 's what makes you to be poor , basically.

So we have a really wrong concept of what is wealth or to be rich. We believe that to re-reach is to have a lot of things , many things. But that 's not to be rich. The word rich comes from a rich that means to rule to rule what you have to rule yourself , to rule something in reality.

That means to rule something in reality.

So who is rich? The one that is able to administrated what you have. The person that can have self-government.

Okay? Well , it 's not related with money. Well , it 's related to the ability to handle and administrated what I have. When we understand this basic concept is when we can talk about all the rest.

We usually make this mistake and we have to transcend this idea that wealth means to have money or to have a lot of things. Actually , the origin of the word rich means to rule yourself , to rule your own things. It 's not about money , it 's about your own things. Well , comes from the word , all the things that is related with wealth.

Well , something that is good , all the goods.

So this makes the well , I am well.

So the concept of feeling well is wealth.

So it 's not about money , it 's about feeling well and everything is okay. Yes?

So when I say the own , your own things , we talk about three different levels , the physical , emotional and the mental.

So let 's talk about this three.

So in the physical way , of course , we have three needs to eat , to sleep and to produce.

So in the third thing , if I am able to produce my own food , if I am able to administrated my money or resources in order to have the food every day , if I have my own place that does not depend from anybody , where I can sleep and be secure. And if I have the tools in order to produce something that I can exchange with others , so I am rich , because I have my own things. I rule my own body , my own matter.

So now , the emotional , in emotional level , you can all reach out when you know how to administrated your own emotions. When you know how to handle your own emotions , how to discern into what is good for you and what is wrong for you , what is bad for you , so you just decide and you are free to decide. Also , in the society to live away some relationships and you can decide freely to have some relationships. Basically , it is to be unconditional , because if you are conditioned by something , you are not rich , you do n't have wealth.

And you are unconditional when you administrated your own emotions and can decide and discern by yourself between the good things for you , that makes you emotionally rich. And then we have the mind. The wealth of the mind is when a person is open to learn every day. When a person is open to read a book , when a person sees a movie , goes into another culture , learn from a religion , talks with someone , speaks about the debate about stuff.

When you learn another language , a person that is open to learn every day and is not close to only one idea is a person that is rich in the mind that has mental wealth. This helps us understand that we do n't have to relate wealth with money , because you can have wealth in your body , in your soul , emotional or your mind. You can also talk about wealth , which is the spiritual wealth. Those persons that can go within , to live within , to find the inner truth and share it outside or do something with it.

That would be spiritual wealth. Besides , there is a lot of people that can be rich or have wealth into different levels. For example , there are people that is rich in the mind , but it is poor in the other two. There are people that is rich in the soul , in the emotions , but in the other two.

For people that is rich in the physical , but it is poor in the other two. Of course , there are many options that we can take as poor in many of its life and rich in other aspects. But usually in the common process of life , usually people , starts to keep this path going on when you , those wealth already covered , like beginning by the physical. When you have the physical wealth covered , then you can go into the emotional one.

Once you work with your emotional wealth , then you can work in your mental and in your mind. Once you did that , you go to the spiritual. That 's how usually we do our path.

So there are people that maybe can consider themselves that they are rich spiritually. But if you are not rich in your mind , this means that you clearly are not rich in your spiritual. Because the spiritual is 100 % open. And if you are not open to other things , if you are not open in your mind , and you just keep in parallel one religion , so you do n't have spiritual wealth.

You just have a belief which is different and many things. If you feel good , it 's a belief.

So of course , that for sure there are a lot of people that can do this path of wealth many different ways. Maybe you are born in a different way that you can do this in many ways. But I 'm not here to spot each one of those ways. I 'm going to try to speak about the entire one that affects us as humanity.

So in biology , in life , all the living beings that exist , use our living form physical wealth , not the other ones , just the physical wealth. Why is that? Because our life , the life of every living being is done in order to reach energy.

So our entire evolution has been in order to find wealth in the physical aspect.

So that 's why they live to eat , they live to sleep and they live to reproduce. And all their lives is about that.

So they are trying to find the balance through these main needs in order to be rich.

So this system of rich energy has made throughout the evolution that millions and millions of years. These living beings have been developing tools in order to find a balance in this fight for energy. And this creates a symbiosis in biology that made everyone to live in kind of a harmony. Even though they are fighting for it , the system has been so perfectly designed through the evolution that they 've and a balance in what they need.

This is why when we look into nature , even if they are every day looking for this wealth , they already are rich. They got wealth because they accomplished to manage every day what they need.

Okay , so they accomplished to have wealth in the physical aspect. From all the animals , then how many it started to do something different? They found a way to sleep properly , not to be scared about enemies. And that made them sleep much longer , that made them sleep very well.

And that meant better synopsis in the brain and better connections to think.

So they started to dream. By dreaming , they started to have new ideas that they could n't see outside , but they could see inside.

So with the hands , they managed to create tools in order to manifest their dreams into matter. And that 's the difference that we got from other animals. Even if other animals dream , we managed to create ideas from the dreams. Because we slept better than animals.

Because of this , we also created another system of survival , which was this groups of people that helped each other. And that 's what we call empathy and sympathy. We spoke about them. Empathy and sympathy are things that other animals also have.

But humans started to use it as a way to transcend information to transmit data through speaking , through sharing , to creating , through creating traditions , culture and so on.

So they use empathy as a way of survival. When humans started to understand how to manage the physical wealth , they understood that they could also transcend through time , not only surviving every day , but to survive through the entire year. When they managed that , when they knew how to handle that , so they had time to develop the emotional wealth through empathy.

So in this way is how we start to relate with other people , and we develop the emotional intelligence.

So suddenly during this process of exchange with others , we start to exchange data information. Others teach us something we teach something to others , and through that , we start to learn to know new people. We start to write , to seem , to create philosophies , legends. And when we start to do this , we create , or discover , our mind wealth.

We open our mind. And because we start to go away and watch in wider the world , we also start to look into the stars , into the cosmos. And that takes us to look within the origin of the humanism , the origin of all the traditions , of the atomic traditions , that brings us to spiritual wealth.

So we have done all this path. When we start to reincarnated , it does n't matter from which wealth we start our lives or whatever. But this means that in ourselves , we all have this code of this path. That 's how we did it.

Until now , all beautiful , but what happened , the shaman says to the lived group that the spirits told him that that person must rule over all the others , because the spirits tell them to do it. And why is this? To secure the family and the group?

So that person has shown every can lead and have to , above all , show the enemies that can protect the hurt.

Okay?

So it started in this way , the idea of the king , reach is also one name of king. It comes from regime , is the same word , regime , one that rules.

So remember that we spoke about this once. This is not because people were bad and they wanted to control. No , this is for protection. They created this idea of the king or the queen.

In order to connect and unify all the tribe as one , with one symbol , in one person , the person could be in charge of protection and guidance.

So it 's not bad , it 's perfect for that.

So speaking about thousands and thousands of years ago , what happens here is that the family starts to grow , the tribe starts to grow , everything , the population , start to have more wealth.

So the territory is wider and wider , and suddenly the king or the queen finds tennis , the limits of the enemies , and they start to fight each other.

So the king or the queen has to show their power against the others. To protect their owners , let 's go to something simple. What king or queen has to do? What happened if I do this?

If I do this and I go speaking slowly and lower and being a friend and scared to watch there and what would you think? Nobody could do that when you want to empower yourself , you have to put your chest in front to move your hands to watch your face and speak loud.

So imagine like a nature , like the peacock , for example , best image , peacock , lalayan , but the peacock mostly. The peacock has this big tail with many colors. And it opens , showing everything , like saying here I am , and I am the best.

So as many colors it has , the enemies , the other person , they will say , oh , this guy has too many things. I ca n't fight with him. All animals , all beings in nature , we do the same. We position our bodies so they can see that we have power and we put colors to show that we have things.

The same thing , thousands of years ago , was done by the kings and the queens. All this goal and colors , so they could show themselves that they have power.

So if those person has so many things and colors and power , this means that behind with all this wealth , ca n't afford an army to protect , to fight.

So just by looking at the king or the queen , the enemies would say better we have to take care of ourselves with this.

So what happened in history , that eventually some of these kings and queens that had a big luck of emotional wealth and mental wealth , they start to do exactly the same with its people , its own people , then they use with enemies.

So they started to control their own to show the power that they have.

So through the next thousands of years , what happened with humanity , that these kind of people with a very luck , great luck of intelligence and wealth in the emotional , spiritual and mind , they started to control and rule upon the others.

So from kingdoms , we went into feudalism , from feudalism to bourgeoisie , from bourgeoisie , we went into politicians and protocols and entrepreneurs.

So in the beginning of the times for humanity to be rich , it was equals to security. In another part of humanity of a history to be rich , it was to be part of the group of the kings and the chosen ones.

So for the next part of history to be rich was a goal in between different classes , something that you have to reach to get into the next class.

So in the next part of humanity of history , if you manage , the people was divided into the poor ones and the rich ones. The rich ones here , they were controlling the other ones.

So this one here , the poor ones , understood that the rich ones were the bad people. And this is how the history shows us how the concept of being rich has been distorted into what we know today.

So from the next , for the history , the 300 years that we are living in the last 300 years , the poor people start to take power over the rich people. But in a very weird way.

So what really happens is that eventually the capitalism takes power into the idea of the new systems , which means that they give opportunities for people to become rich. But they have to suffer a lot because the system was done in order for them to not to reach even if they have the opportunity. It 's very difficult to do it.

So the system may then believe that they can become rich so they can feel free the freedom to be able to do that , but just as an idea.

So this is what takes us to the revolution of the people , creates the communism. The communism is all this people that starts to manifest the idea that we should not be oppressed by this system of rich of wealth.

So we have to work all together in order to distribute the wealth so we can have all we need.

So what was wrong with the communism? The communism says that the government is the one that decides what is wealth.

So the wealth that you can have in each one of the bodies in the fourth thing in your full amount of money.

So and spiritual the communism is the one that says you can have this amount of wealth for this , this amount of wealth for this and you can not go beyond that. If you do that so this is wrong.

So it 's the government that decides for you.

So you do n't have freedom.

So eventually in the social communism the people start to wake up saying I want to do this or express that or do this.

So this is why the system starts to collapse to itself and they create dictatorship. What every communism ends up in a dictatorship because there is an aside an alter key that says only one person can tell you what to do because it represents the state and that person morally approved to decide what the population needs.

So the reason why this system collapse is because by nature we are the sign to grow and expand. If there is a system that tells you what you ca n't do and you are oppressed and you can not express what you are.

So that system is determined to fail. Because basically there is no one that can leave just by an idea ideas do n't give you food. And in the other hand we have the capitalism which is working today. But the capitalism is determined to end too.

As you can see the capitalism does n't work because there are a lot of people that is poor still today. And why is this because the capitalism ca n't manage the poor people because they give the free opportunity to grow but this growth is about. The boring everything. Fighting to each other in order to reach money , wealth and to have things is about accumulation.

Is about having many things to become rich.

So basically both of these systems are wrong because both of these systems had tools to control and rule our organization. We can imagine concept of what is wealth. Is the ability to rule yourself to administrated our own things to govern your own life. And these two systems they are doing that.

So any system that rules through laws. In order to assure that you can have things. It 's just doing that but it 's not about wealth. It 's not giving you wealth.

It 's not making you rich. It 's just giving you stuff. And that system gives things in order to keep self in that system and in the government.

So I repeat this does n't mean that those two systems were wrong. For the best we got in the circumstances that we were living or going through. But now we have another thing. We have networks.

We have technology. It 's another environment.

So that 's why these two systems does n't work anymore. And they are destined for.

So in order to maybe this change happened. The first thing that we have to do as citizens is to acknowledge that to be rich is not to have things. And that to be poor is not an option. When we hear some people say that we are doing all this for the poor people.

Or from the poor people will be the heavens. The kingdom of the heavens. When we hear these things. We can clearly hear this concepts of people.

And we can say that they need the poor. They need to create a culture of poor in order to keep themselves in the power. Make the poor believe that to be poor is good. The poor is not a rich.

The poor is not a rich. The poor is not a rich. The vibration for today is. From the Greek Array.

In the beginning of life , the earth environment was quite hostile. And thousands of volcanic eruptions , caldera of boiling thermal waters with toxic metals and deadly gases. In this environment , the first living cells without any organelles or nucleus rubbed themselves with an organic code. And this constitutes the base of the rest up to today.

Even today , being the most abundant ones in the oceans. The poor is not a rich. The poor is not a rich. The poor is not a rich.

The poor is not a rich. I use my imagination to expand space around towards the infinite. Making it into a deep , dark void where I find myself levitating in.

Softly and slowly. I start to stretch my body in every direction. I start to carry the space around. Make it dance.

I start to carry the space around. Slowly , like me. Slowly , like me. Holding my legs.

Just hug yourself or just take your hands. I recognize myself as a seed of the great universal tree that we have live. I can feel the potential with it to become a universe of my own. And to grow , I perceive the light that comes from above surrounding my entire body.

I ca n't believe how this ray of light starts to become a big drop of water and light. I can perceive and feel how the speed drop of water touches my ground and gets inside. I can feel like this within me. This source that was sounds in our universe generating the energy that is abundant in me.

I can be in this trend of all the matter that I am making me feel secure of myself.

So I can recognize how rich I am the wealth in each one of my bodies and levels. To the breath , I start to bring with your hands from your knees. This wealth towards all your body , making your hands in your leaves and your feet into a world. I try showing up in myまず look.

## Energy Work

Tell photos and shows had snow. As I bring this wealth all around me , I start to expand my arms and legs to the side Tunes , my arms become in branches. My fingers seem to leave some flowers. My legs into the roots.

And I expand , recognize myself as a tree , a new tree of life. I am thriving of wealth. Recall me , recognize myself as rich in every aspect. I have the wealth in me.

And from it , I ca n't distinct. Each one of my paths. I am origin of old path. I am origin of old paths.

I am origin of old path. I am origin of old path. I am origin of old path. I am origin of old path.

I am origin of old path. I am origin of old path. I take the bread and each one at it 's own time. Come back here and now.

## Q&A

I am origin of old path. Those who are following the task for this one , take all this energy , put it into the water , and bring this water to the poor into the seeds and the plants that we have served. Thank you everybody for being here another day. And as always , see you tomorrow in the same time.
