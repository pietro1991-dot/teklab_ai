## Introduction

Hi everybody , good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

Today I had to move again because there is another wedding. Besides the wedding , I 'm feeling really bad today. I have like gaseous and being a bit dc and a lot of headache.

So , not feeling that well , so that 's why my face.

So , I am not even in 50 %. I guess what happened is that these days I 've been changing the way I eat to make the fasting. And I guess that 's what is happening. My body is like trying to understand what happens.

So , I 'm in the process of demo.

So , that 's why. I feel so weird. And yesterday also I had , I had been seeing the screen so much that it was so shiny. That when I finished , I could n't see half of from this eye.

I could n't see anything.

So , I was a bit worried.

So today I shut off all the lights. I already know why my body is like this.

So , do n't worry. I 'm trying to put it in order.

So , sorry if I do n't have the energy or the mood as always to speak. But anyway.

So , topic for today related to the feet , the ankles is when. Once I read some comments , I do n't know where that said that it is not good for me to show. It is not good that I show that I am tired or that I do n't have the will to speak or whatever , because it is bad for the students. It 's not good for the people that listen.

It 's like a fault of respect for you. And listen.

Sorry. But I do n't really care.

So , I rather tell you that I 'm wrong today that I am sad or that I am tired. I rather say that than being a hypocrisy and I like to you that I am not feeling fine when I am not.

So , sorry if someone feels offended by my state.

So , also when I am like this , I kind of had a bad mood.

So , sorry if I say something in a wrong way.

So , they have of course the first the same origin where. My feet. Speaking about the feet chara. My toes.

Ah.

Today is not the day. Ah. Ah.

So , here and now. As all in the European languages. Where comes from the position of an object. As I was saying in the blog , but also as I said some other moments.

All the reality is basically a hologram.

So , it 's not real as we perceive it is a hologram. And this hologram is constituted by two constants. Space in the European language means to throw. Time in the European language means to expand.

So , as you see time in space are not related to physical things. They are describing the process through where the physical things move through.

So space is not equal matter. The reality is constituted by patterns. And those patterns creates a matrix that we call matter.

So , matter the things exist because of patterns. For example , one pattern is an atom. An atom is constituted by a pattern. This pattern is , for example , an electron and a proton.

An electron and a proton. We have here one pattern. Usually also with a neutron.

So , we have three things. And when this replicated itself many times.

So , many atoms in the same way. They conform an element or a composed in chemistry.

So , we have these patterns that creates a matrix of many of these ones. That all of them creates the matter.

So , in this way we can relate that the patterns are the ones that keeps origin to the matter. Even though the patterns are like the base of the matter. The patterns only exist because of the network. Which we call a matrix.

So , without a matrix a network of patterns , patterns can not create matter.

So , matter is basically the creation of the matrix of patterns. In this concept of understanding the pattern , the pattern is like this code that replicate one 's and again , and follows one line.

So , it keeps going in the same line. And this is an image that the ancient people gave to the father , because the father , which in the European language , is pattern , was the one that guided everyone and conducted everyone into one direction. It was the one that was bringing the. .

. The people in one direction , the family , the group , leading them.

So , that 's why the idea of pattern comes from pattern , which is father.

So , all the patterns that repeat are related to the energy of the father.

So , matter comes from the. . . In the European word , matter that means matter.

So , matter means the things that has a weight that has been created that has become something.

So , as we can see here , matter emerges from patterns of patterns. These patterns can all exist due to a network. And these matrix , these network , is connected by two constants , time and space.

So , here you have a magistrate here in the video.

So , reality comes from the Latin word , rest. That means something. The thing.

So , I think , is thrown through the space. Space is this vacuum through where the things move through. And it expands and transforms by the aspect of time. And remember that we have spoken about this , the network between time and space.

Yeah?

So , important thing to understand here. Time and space are not places through where the things move. Time and space are the constants of the matter. This means that without matter , there is no time and no space.

## Q&A

So , this means that time and space does n't exist in the mind of the universe. Time and space only exist in the manifestation of that mind. This is how we can get now to the question of why we are here if there is nothing really. If there is , if everything is holographic and time and space does n't exist.

So , let 's remember the example that I did today in the log.

So , we spoke yesterday that the reason why we really are here is because there was one particle or one option of the particle that has been manifested. And why has been manifested? Because our consciousness and mind watching that particle or that option of the particle.

Remember that there is only one particle expressed in many options of time and space. And our mind , our consciousness , watch one of those options.

So , it manifested. That option.

So , we are the option of one particle that does n't exist , but because we are staring at it , we manifested. What we have here does n't really exist , what exists is the microcosmos where nothing really applies the laws of physics.

So , anything there in the microcosmos can be , where there are wave , where there are a particle , can be zero or one , it does n't matter.

So , the only thing that makes the microcosmos exist is the attention of the mind in only one of those options in only one of those possibilities.

So , this means that everything that exists in the third dimension in the matter only exists as a projection , as an option of only one particle or wave that is vibrating. And the best way to understand this , I guess , is with example of the Sun and the Sea. We have here a beautiful sunset in the waves of the Sea. What is here , the Sun , is a particle , and what is the Sea , is the waves.

So , here we have the particles and the waves together.

So , where we see here in this , when we go to the Sea and see the Sun set on the waves , we will see that the Sun is like replicating itself in the different waves , like a mirror of the light. When we go and see the ocean and the waves and the Sun setting , we will see like kind of if the Sun is replicated by many in the waves of the ocean , many reflections , many waves , many suns.

Now , even if the Sun is on the back and we are looking staring at the Sea in front of us , the light of the Sun will be reflected to our eyes by many in every one of the waves.

So , from different point of view , the reflection will be in our eyes anyway.

So , this means that only one Sun is replicated , reflected by thousands in each one of the waves of the ocean and we have five oceans.

So , everything that exists in the reality are just reflections of only one Sun. And depending on the vibration of the wave , this reflection will be one way or another. This is why , even if we are all one , each one of us is unique.

So , the question here would be , where , where am I in this? Where am I going to? Where I come from? In this system , if everything , if all existence is just a reflection.

In our point of view of humans , we have believed that we have to move because we come from warm place and we are heading into another place.

So , we move constantly.

So , because of a simple human and physical aspect , we have this belief that we have to come from somewhere and we have to go somewhere. But when we start to look into the other reality , we suddenly figure out that we do n't have to go anywhere and we never came from anywhere that we have always been where we are supposed to be.

So , this is why we can hear sometimes that we are always where we are supposed to be. It 's not that romantic day , day , day. It 's actually like that. It 's in the microcosmos.

It 's like that. You have always been where you are supposed to be because it 's the only place possible.

So , now , when we understand this , we usually go into the opposite side of this belief. And we start to say , well , if everything is one and I am always where I 'm supposed to be , so why to move , why to travel , why to do this , or why to go somewhere , to go back to a source , why if I am always where I 'm supposed to be and I am just a projection. And when we ask these questions , is when we again start to see the reality through the point of view of humans and the question , where? We have been deciding this , this reality through the patterns of a human , of a family.

So , we said that the matter is the mother that creators all and the father is the patterns that guide us here.

So , that 's why , through time and space , we were looking for these images of a god that is our father and goddess that is our mother. And we also have to sign the idea of where , according to migrations , how humans have been moving through the planet.

So , when we have designed in history , was according to our reality , we were living in a place that had bad things for us and we started to move forward to take a path to find the right place where we have food , safety and all the things. Is n't that very similar to the image of a hell , the purgatory and heaven , the paradise? This is the idea that we have created in the universe that we are coming from one place heading to another one that we call coming back home.

So , what is the one that created the idea of where , of a spot , a place? Actually , has been that option of a particle that has been seen by the consciousness of the mind of the universe of mind. That 's why that particle has been manifested in an atom in a reality in a place.

So , the thing here is not that we are coming from one place heading to another. The thing here is that was the mind deciding to experience one place.

So , here is when we are getting the idea that each one of these places is not a place is an idea is the conjunction of an idea. It is an Edward. It is what we in the brain call a neuronal synapses.

So , the main idea , the observer , what it does , is to create a path through this network , creating a new idea of itself , creating a new pattern exactly as our brain does , designing path of information.

So , our brain works exactly like that. Our brain is a connection of neurons that are encoding data information and they create like this path of information. Like the patterns of information of neurons that connect each other and they keep that data.

So , it 's more useful for me to use it the next time.

So , through the experiences of doing something , the brain designs a path to find faster the answers of that information. For example , I am here speaking English because I learned English many years ago , I am practicing English every day.

So , my brain has assigned a way to find the correct words and how to use them in order to transmit an idea.

So , I do n't have to think about the words in English anymore because my brain already know how to find it because the path we are taking already.

So , they are there. The universe works exactly the same. The universe also creates these patterns through the living beings , through us. All the creatures that exist in the universe , we move through , we connect with others , we speak with others , we travel to different places.

We go to different places. That 's why there are powerful places in each aspect path along the planet. That 's why we are moved to travel through the planet. Because we are the neurons connecting data information for new thoughts.

So , to the question where the answer is here. And to the question to where the answer is everywhere. Because we expand in time. And we move through the space.

This is why we are moved to go to places to connect with sacred places to know people , to exchange to travel. Because is the way in which we are creating new data for the universe , creating new options. We are not coming from any place. We are not going anywhere.

Here and now. I hope that with information from yesterday with the question when and today with the question where. We can understand better why we say here and now. The vibration for today is rule.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the wisdom 's vision. The code for today is the constellation of Lyr. There is only one tool capable of creating the best of help. Music.

The rhythm , melody and harmony allows that all chaotic finds order and coherence. This to the scent , to the underworld and the scent on the feet. It is fundamental to be in resonance. In the perfect vibration and the Lyr is the instrument that in ancient times reminds us of that purpose.

Let 's go to the element. Take an impression. And as we do every day , bring your designs far throughout every one of the backgrounds. Up to the engine.
