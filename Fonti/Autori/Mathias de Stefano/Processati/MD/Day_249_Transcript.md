## Overview

Today we arrive at the ankles chakra of the Mental Week of Aries. The topic is the question **Where?**

This teaching reveals that reality is a **hologram**, constituted by patterns that create a matrix we call matter. Understanding "where" requires us to see that **location** is not a place but a **conjunction of patterns** in a network.

And most profoundly: we are the **neurons** of the universe, creating pathways of information through our travels, connections, and experiences.

---

## Etymology of "Where"

### Position of an Object

In all European languages, "where" comes from the **position of an object**.

Just like "when" describes the position of an object in time/space, "where" describes the position of an object in space.

---

## Reality is a Hologram

### Two Constants: Space and Time

All reality is basically a **hologram**.

It's not real as we perceive it—it's a hologram.

This hologram is constituted by two constants:

1. **Space** (in European language means "to throw")
2. **Time** (in European language means "to expand")

### Not Physical Things

Space and time are not related to physical things.

They are describing the **process** through where the physical things move through.

**Space is not equal to matter.**

---

## Patterns Create Matter

### The Matrix of Patterns

Reality is constituted by **patterns**.

Those patterns create a **matrix** that we call **matter**.

Matter (the things) exist because of **patterns**.

### Example: The Atom

One pattern is an **atom**.

An atom is constituted by a pattern:
- One electron
- One proton
- Usually also one neutron

We have three things creating one pattern.

### Replication Creates Elements

When this pattern replicates itself many times—many atoms in the same way—they conform an **element** or a **compound** in chemistry.

### Patterns Create the Matrix

We have these patterns that create a matrix of many of these patterns.

All of them together create **matter**.

The patterns are the ones that give origin to matter.

---

## Patterns Need a Network

### Patterns Alone Don't Create Matter

Even though the patterns are the base of matter, **patterns only exist because of the network** (the matrix).

Without a matrix, a network of patterns, patterns cannot create matter.

### Matter = Matrix of Patterns

**Matter is basically the creation of the matrix of patterns.**

---

## The Father: Pattern

### The Pattern Follows One Line

The pattern is like a code that replicates itself once and again, and follows one line.

It keeps going in the same line.

### Why Called "Father"

This is an image the ancient people gave to the **father**.

The father, which in European language is **pattern** (or **pater**), was the one that:
- Guided everyone
- Conducted everyone into one direction
- Brought the people in one direction
- Led the family, the group

That's why the idea of **pattern** comes from **pattern** (father).

All the patterns that repeat are related to the **energy of the father**.

---

## The Mother: Matter

### Matter Has Weight

**Matter** comes from the European word **mater**, meaning **mother**.

Matter means the things that have **weight**, that have been **created**, that have **become** something.

### Matter Emerges from Patterns

Matter emerges from patterns of patterns.

These patterns can all exist due to a network.

This matrix, this network, is connected by two constants: **time and space**.

---

## Reality = Res (The Thing)

### Etymology of Reality

**Reality** comes from the Latin word **res**, meaning **something**, **the thing**.

The thing is **thrown through space**.

Space is the vacuum through where things move through.

And it **expands and transforms** by the aspect of time.

### Time and Space Are Constants of Matter

Important thing to understand:

**Time and space are not places through where things move.**

Time and space are the **constants of matter**.

This means: **Without matter, there is no time and no space.**

Time and space don't exist in the mind of the universe.

Time and space only exist in the **manifestation** of that mind.

---

## Why We Are Here: The Observer Effect

### The Hologram of Existence

If everything is holographic and time and space don't exist in the universal mind, why are we here?

### One Particle, Many Options

There is **only one particle** expressed in many options of time and space.

Our mind, our consciousness, watches **one of those options**.

So it manifests that option.

### We Are the Option Being Observed

We are the option of one particle that doesn't exist, but because we are **staring at it**, we manifest it.

What we have here doesn't really exist. What exists is the **microcosmos**, where nothing really obeys the laws of physics.

Anything in the microcosmos can be a wave, a particle, zero or one—it doesn't matter.

### Consciousness Manifests Reality

The only thing that makes the microcosmos exist is the **attention of the mind** on only one of those options, one of those possibilities.

Everything that exists in the third dimension (matter) only exists as a **projection**, an option of only one particle or wave that is vibrating.

---

## The Sun and the Sea: Understanding the Hologram

### One Sun, Many Reflections

Imagine a beautiful sunset in the waves of the sea.

The **Sun** is a particle.

The **Sea** is the waves.

Here we have particles and waves together.

### Reflected in Every Wave

When we see the ocean and the Sun setting, we see the Sun like it's **replicated** in many different waves—like a mirror of light.

Many reflections, many waves, many suns.

Even if the Sun is on the back and we're looking at the sea in front of us, the light of the Sun will be **reflected to our eyes** by many in every wave.

From different points of view, the reflection will be in our eyes anyway.

### Only One Sun

This means **only one Sun** is replicated, reflected by thousands in each wave of the ocean.

And we have five oceans.

**Everything that exists in reality are just reflections of only one Sun.**

Depending on the vibration of the wave, this reflection will be one way or another.

### We Are All One, Yet Each Unique

This is why, even if we are all one, **each one of us is unique**.

---

## Where Am I in This?

### The Human Question

The question here would be: **Where am I in this?**

- Where am I going to?
- Where do I come from?

In this system, if everything, if all existence, is just a reflection?

### The Belief of Movement

From our point of view as humans, we believe we have to **move** because:
- We come from one place
- We're heading to another place

We move constantly.

Because of this simple human and physical aspect, we have this belief that we have to come from somewhere and go somewhere.

### The Other Reality

When we start to look into the other reality, we suddenly figure out:

**We don't have to go anywhere, and we never came from anywhere.**

We have always been where we are supposed to be.

### Always Where You're Supposed to Be

This is why we can hear sometimes: "You are always where you are supposed to be."

It's not just a romantic saying.

**It's actually like that** in the microcosmos.

You have always been where you are supposed to be because **it's the only place possible**.

---

## The Danger of Misunderstanding

### The Opposite Extreme

When we understand "I'm always where I'm supposed to be," we usually go to the opposite side of this belief.

We start to say:
- "Well, if everything is one and I'm always where I'm supposed to be, why move?"
- "Why travel?"
- "Why do anything?"
- "Why go back to a source if I'm always where I'm supposed to be and I'm just a projection?"

### Still Seeing Through Human Eyes

When we ask these questions, we're **again** seeing reality through the point of view of humans and the question "where?"

We're deciding this reality through the patterns of a human, of a family.

---

## Father and Mother: Pattern and Matter

### The Metaphor

We said:
- **Matter is the mother** that creates all
- **Father is the patterns** that guide us here

Through time and space, we were looking for these images:
- A god that is our **father**
- A goddess that is our **mother**

### Where According to Migration

We've designed the idea of **where** according to **migrations**—how humans have been moving through the planet.

### The Journey from Hell to Heaven

When we designed "where" in history, it was according to our reality:
- We were living in a place with bad things
- We started to move forward
- To take a path
- To find the right place where we have food, safety, all things

Isn't that very similar to the image of:
- **Hell** (the bad place)
- **Purgatory** (the journey)
- **Heaven/Paradise** (the good place)

This is the idea we created in the universe: that we're coming from one place, heading to another one, that we call "coming back home."

---

## What Creates the Idea of "Where"?

### The Mind Choosing an Option

What created the idea of where, of a spot, a place?

It has been **that option of a particle** that has been seen by the consciousness, by the mind of the universe.

That's why that particle has been manifested in an atom, in a reality, in a place.

### Not Coming From or Going To

The thing here is not that we're coming from one place heading to another.

The thing is: **The mind decided to experience one place.**

---

## Where = Idea, Not Location

### Each Place is a Conjunction of Ideas

Each one of these places is not a place—it's an **idea**.

It's the **conjunction of an idea**.

It's an **Edward** (a location in consciousness).

It's what we in the brain call a **neuronal synapse**.

### The Brain of the Universe

The main idea, the **observer**, creates a path through this network.

It creates a **new idea of itself**, creating a new **pattern**—exactly as our brain does, designing paths of information.

---

## Our Brain Works Like the Universe

### Neurons Encoding Data

Our brain is a connection of neurons that are **encoding data**, information.

They create pathways of information—patterns of information.

Neurons connect to each other and **keep that data** so it's more useful to use next time.

### Designing Faster Paths

Through experiences of doing something, the brain designs a path to find **faster answers** to that information.

### Example: Speaking English

I'm speaking English because I learned it many years ago and practice every day.

My brain has assigned a way to find the correct words and how to use them to transmit an idea.

I don't have to think about the words in English anymore because my brain already knows how to find them—the path is already there.

---

## We Are the Neurons of the Universe

### The Universe Works the Same

The universe also creates these **patterns** through living beings, through us.

All the creatures that exist in the universe:
- We move through
- We connect with others
- We speak with others
- We travel to different places
- We go to different places

### Why There Are Powerful Places

That's why there are **powerful places** in each aspect of the planet.

That's why we are moved to **travel** through the planet.

**Because we are the neurons connecting data information for new thoughts.**

---

## The Answer to "Where?"

### To the Question "Where?"

The answer is: **Here.**

### To the Question "To Where?"

The answer is: **Everywhere.**

Because we **expand in time**, and we **move through space**.

### Why We Travel

This is why we are moved to:
- Go to places
- Connect with sacred places
- Know people
- Exchange
- Travel

Because it's the way in which we are **creating new data for the universe**, creating new options.

### We Are Not Coming From or Going To

We are **not** coming from any place.

We are **not** going anywhere.

**Here and now.**

---

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on your breathing.

### Crown Through Ankles

Bring your divine spark down through every one of your chakras.

Up to the ankles.

Activate the question at each level: **Where?**

- Where do I believe?
- Where do I think?
- Where do I speak from?
- Where do I feel?
- Where am I?
- Where do I create?
- Where do I manifest?
- Where do I walk?
- **Where is my path?**

### Integration

Recognize that "where" is asking: **Where in the network am I?**

You are a neuron in the brain of the universe, creating pathways of information through your experiences, connections, and movements.

Sound: **Gü**

**I am the wisdom's vision. I am the wisdom's vision. I am the wisdom's vision.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Stretching and yawning, each one comes back here and now at your own time.

Because you have always been here, and now is the only time that exists.

## Key Insights

- Reality is a hologram constituted by patterns creating a matrix of matter.
- Space and time are constants of matter, not independent dimensions.
- Patterns (father energy) guide; matter (mother energy) creates.
- One particle has infinite options; consciousness observing one option manifests it.
- We are reflections of one Sun (consciousness) on many waves (experiences).
- "Where am I?" has one answer: Here. "To where?" has one answer: Everywhere.
- We are neurons in the brain of the universe, creating pathways through our travels and connections.
- Sacred places are powerful neuronal synapses in the planetary network.
- We are not coming from anywhere or going anywhere—we are creating data in the eternal now.
- The journey from "hell" to "heaven" is a human projection of migration patterns onto cosmic reality.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness: Recognizing Your Location

Today, when you ask "Where should I go?" pause and recognize:

You're already **where you're supposed to be**—this is the option the universe is observing right now.

The question is not "where should I go?" but "what pathway am I creating from here?"

### You Are a Neuron

Every person you meet, every place you visit, every connection you make is **encoding data** in the universal brain.

You're not wandering aimlessly. You're creating **neuronal pathways** for new thoughts in consciousness.

### Sacred Geometry of Place

When you feel drawn to a place, recognize: that's a **powerful synapse** in the planetary network.

You're being moved there to connect data, to create new patterns, to encode information.

## Q&A

### Q: If I'm always where I'm supposed to be, why do I feel lost?

Because you're confusing "where you are" (the location in the network) with "where you think you should be" (the ego's projection). You're exactly where the universe is observing—that's not wrong. The feeling of "lost" is data being encoded.

### Q: How can I be a neuron if I'm stuck at home and not traveling?

Neurons don't only connect through physical movement. They connect through:
- Thoughts you think
- People you speak with (even online)
- Information you process
- Energy you exchange

You're creating pathways constantly.

### Q: What about people who feel called to a specific place but can't get there?

The "call" is the universe **preparing the pathway**. The longing encodes the data before the physical movement. Sometimes the journey is in consciousness first, matter second.

### Q: If we're not going anywhere, what's the point of spiritual paths?

The path isn't to "get somewhere." It's to **create patterns**, encode wisdom, and become conscious of the network. The journey creates the neurons; the neurons create new thoughts for the universe.

### Q: How is this different from being passive or lazy?

Recognizing you're "here" doesn't mean don't move—it means move **consciously**. You're not trying to escape "here" to get "there." You're expanding "here" into "everywhere" through conscious connection and pattern-making.

### Q: What about the idea of "going home" spiritually?

"Home" is not a location—it's **remembering the network**. You don't go to it; you recognize you never left it. The journey home is waking up to the fact that you're already in it.

### Q: Why do sacred places feel more powerful?

Because they're **dense neuronal synapses**—places where many pathways cross, where much data has been encoded over time. Like certain neurons in your brain that light up more because they're highly connected.
