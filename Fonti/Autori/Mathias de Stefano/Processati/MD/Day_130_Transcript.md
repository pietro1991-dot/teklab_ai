## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening , everyone. And sorry that I posted the in the blog really late. I just did. But it 's just that I was n't able because of all activities for today.

So I wrote it an hour ago.

So the topic for today is expansion. And I will try not to expand too much. Because to be sincere , I am really tired. And so tomorrow we start again very , very late.

So first of all , we start with this. I would like to talk about a message that we received today in the pyramid that is related somehow with the topic for today. And I wrote it in the blog too. I do n't know if I explained this.

But the information that I 'm going to share now is related to the three kings of the story.

Remember that we are close to the December 21st , to the December 31st that is the battle-hem star , the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. And this conjunction tells about the story of three kings that were astronomers that could see this conjunction and they knew that the king of earth was about to be born.

So this is not a Christian story. It 's very much older. And it 's related to this conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn , but followed by three kings that are the three stars of Orion 's belt.

So as we spoke for sure , some day , the three pyramids of Gia are related to the three stars.

So the three kings , the three kingdoms of the spirit , the soul and the body.

## Q&A

So today in the pyramid , when we were doing our task , where we were supposed to do , there was one being that king and said , I am from the kingdom of the body. And this is my gift for you. My gift is the mirror. But he did a game with the words saying that it was the mirror.

The mirror where you look at yourself. But he said it in a way that was the mirror.

So the element of one of the three gifts of the three kings.

So that makes me understand of this gift of the three kings.

So now I 'm going to explain why the mirror. What he explained is somehow not like I am going to explain now , but very symbolically , he said that the mirror is like a how do you say Russian , Russian , Russian , Russian , it 's like a Russian. The represents the spiritual world manifested in the material world , in the physical world. And so this represents that the first gift is not the element , the Russian exactly , but the concept of how the spiritual becomes into the physical by the mirror mirroring the subtle levels to the density levels.

The message of the mirror , the gift of the mirror , was that everything the universe is mirroring itself. It 's a constant expansion and expression of one 's self.

So when we are looking into the future , it 's said by reflection , the one we are looking in the future is also looking to its own future.

So in order to receive the messages of the future that we want to receive the ideas , we have to turn back to our past and to see our kit from the past , straight into its eyes and to tell to that kit , all the wisdom that we have accomplished through life , sharing our ideas , our emotions , our thoughts , our growth with that kit in the past.

So as we do that , our self of the future will also be a reflection turned to us , looking toward us and tell us about everything that he learned , and we will receive some information from the future.

So by the law of reflection , the way to speak with the future is by looking into our eyes from the past.

So that was the gift that this being gave us , saying this is the mirror , this is the mirror , this is to look to yourself.

So the expansion that we have to speak about today , is related to the mirror when we say that the universe , which is the inside project into the outside , and it 's seen its own image reflected.

So by looking at image , we can see different perspective of ourselves.

So we start to look for more different dimensions of ourselves to see , specifically different perspectives , perceptions , dimensions of our reality. The universe by this mirror is watching itself and then this , this same mirror , starts to divide by factorization and starts to divide once and again , when again , creating these fractal of the only reality , the one self and it expands into the infinite constantly. This shows us that the universe is a being that is constantly looking for new possibilities of itself. It 's seeking to learn as much as possible from its own being.

So the thing is that as much the universe is looking straight into something , looking for all the dimensions and aspects from that being , from that other projection , the most faces it 's see from that thing.

So suddenly it realized that each one of the particles of the beings that existing the universe creates its own mirrors , its own their own projections and fertilization.

So it starts to be eternal , it starts to be spread eternally.

So basically as closer I get to get to understand something , the closer I get to think what that can become if I look at it in a different way.

So this is why the universe starts to to project itself in many other shapes and so keep going and keep going until it just expands towards the infinite. And it expands into kinds of infinite , the infinite of time and the infinite of space.

## Energy Work

So what we call the expansion of time would be kind of the branches of the tree of life in the universe and what we call expansion of space is the expansion of the roots of the tree of life. But it does n't matter if root or branches is just a concept. And the reason why I say the tree of life is because for all cultures the way to explain this expansion of the universe is through a tree because they see that from unity , it divides into duality and from there in four , in eight and so on. Once again , once again , and the shape of it is kind of a tree.

In this fertilization of this tree , in this expansion , makes that all the things that are going up like the branches starts to go down too because of this ratification. And then the roots also they start to go up because they start to divide and open.

So someday the roots and the branches will match and touch each other.

So this is the shape of the torus , this creates the torus.

So this is how time and space are connected.

So the transmission and the information between all times and spaces are to connect to manifest. When we describe the torus , you will see that this shape is not growing like this expanding itself. It 's growing like this , replicating itself once and again. We have to understand that the torus is this shape that is not expanding towards a direction in the universe , but it is this fertilization of itself that moves once and again replicating its own shape and flourishing from absorbing itself and expanding itself and absorbing.

And so it goes to the outside and goes back to the origin and the origin itself is part of that fertilization.

So this is why the torus , this tree of life is an example of the constant expansion of the universe. This is why the universe is expanding itself through recycling itself.

So this is why every time that we are looking to go back to the core of the universe , of the center to the origin , what we are promoting is to expand even more the universe.

So expansion is not how far the stars can spread in the universe. The expansion is about how many times and how many dimensions can we project our visions of those torus? Yeah.

So by the expansion , the universe is just trying to tell us that we also live in expansion and that we are also trying to create our own universe by expansion.

So today , in the day of the torus of the torus , our goal is to work exactly without expansion. I tell you I was going to speak less. See , if you want to have something more , there is the blog. The duration for today is yay yay yay.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the dimension of eternity. The code for today is that I close Saddle Dodecahedron. The combination of the Icosahedron and the Dodecahedron generates the communication force between heaven and death between air and water , mounting and valley , high and low. Its faces are the sum of the two mentioned figures.

A total of 32. With 12 pentagonal and pentagonal and 20 triangular , 60 edges and 30 vertices. This interaction between both complementary poles make it the base pattern that will originate the throw chara.

## Energy Work

So with this alignment today , we close the mental week of Saddle Various. Let 's see it comfortable. Move your body to stretch , to relax it as we start to focus in our breathing. I remember that I am a seed inside the earth , observing the nutrients , to spread my roots and my leaves above.

I feel the roots going deep and deep as my leaves go up in between the forest and the animals. I expand the rowing up , aside the tree of life. I reach the branches and the leaves searching for the light with every bread. With my hands , I accompany the flowering , I say reach the air over the tree , looking into the forest from above and the savanna.

Take a deep breath , expanding even more , being able to observe the entire forest , the entire savanna , the coast , the sea , the horizon. I say expand , I reach the skies , feeling the light , the yellow light of the sun , the white light from the clouds and the light blue from the sky. Take a deep breath and allow your flower to open wider. I see a rich doubt this year , getting out of it , reaching the outer space and realizing that the light that you are searching for is now in the surface of the earth.

I can see Africa , below me , Europe , Middle East and Asia. And a sightstand and move around the world , I can see the Americas , the Pacific Ocean , and the Indian , and Antarctica. Take a deep breath and take the world between your hands and bring it towards you. But this time you make it bigger as you go inside of it , with this fear around you , and your crown touching the north pole as your feet touch the south pole.

And from here I expand myself. I feel the magical field coming from my crown to the north as the planet going all around this year of the world , like this spider web , coming back to me through my feet. I feel the toured flowing through me , going around me and moving everything that is eternal within me. And I recognize this expansion is eternity with my sound.

Connecting all the dimensions. I feel the toured flowing through me , going around me and moving everything that is eternal. I feel the toured flowing through me , going around me and moving everything that is eternal. I am the dimension of eternity.

I am the dimension of eternity. I am the dimension of eternity. I see eternity. I see I see I see.

I tell you keep going , it is million. I 'm going to meet you in one of mykmokings , I see it. All the times in spaces for me.

So I am yet to earn it to you. Just so you get nice space. Just so you get my shout. And softly I start to bring all the consciousness throughout my body , charestia , stretching and John.

Slowly , each one of its own time , come back here and now.

So today , closing with this tourist day , the energy that came with the weaver , the spider and she does n't speak any language , only networks.

So for whoever rebound , she shared those codes.

So thank you , everybody , as always , for being there to accomplish in another week and see tomorrow at the same time , as always , to begin with the emotional week. See you tomorrow. Bye , see you.
