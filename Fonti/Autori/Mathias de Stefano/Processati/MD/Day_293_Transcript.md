# Day 293 - Consciousness Work

**Author:** Mathias de Stefano  
**Series:** 360 Days Consciousness Journey  
**Source:** 360 Days Consciousness Journey  

## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. How are you? I hope you 're all okay.

So let 's begin with our day because I guess that it will be very long.

So as all I would recommend you to read the post for every day because for sure I write much more information there than I will speak here.

So as always what I explain here is much more as an overview as a summary of the concepts and maybe explain something that I did n't do before.

So today we have two topics to speak about. The respiratory system and the immunology system.

So respiratory and immune.

So respiratory what it means again and speed at it that means to blow.

So what it means respiratory is the system that once and again once and again repeats at blowing.

So what is immune? Immune comes from in that means inside and mono , mono that means to build a fortress or a wall.

So immune means the build , the fortress or a wall that we build to protect the inside.

So these are the two systems that we are speaking about today.

## Guided Meditation

Something that I repeated many times is that we have to remember that the words periods come from this word to the respiration , to breathe. Basically because for the ancient ones the first humanities , the first humans , they thought that the spirit , the soul was related to the breath , was related to the blowing inside of the body.

So this represented the life , the spirit.

So this is why breathing gives birth to the idea of the spiritual world.

So in this case what we can say is that what we can say is that the respiration is the way in which we can understand the movement of the spirit along the entire universe. How we understand the movement of the spirit of the soul throughout the entire cosmos. And how it is because exactly the same way in which we breathe is how the universe kind of breath too. The universe is expanding and contracting all the time.

So this repetition through millions of years is what we can call the respiration , the breathing of the cosmos.

Something that we have spoke about many times , which was the inhalation , the holding , holding the air and excavation of the universe.

So the spirit would move through the universe as the air moves within us in the respiratory system.

So let 's try to understand the respiratory system. Let 's try to make it as best I can do it.

Okay , first of all let 's locate the lineal here and the hypothesis here.

Okay , so this would be the teams. I do n't know all the words in English , so I will need your help. As the image about this , here of course you have the nose. Of the nose , from the nose , you make the strength to bring the air in and then you have nasal hole , okay , here.

Then it goes down through the large , which is this part here that connects with the mouth. That 's why you can breathe also with the mouth. The orange , this is the vocal cords inside the vocal cords. Tragic.

So nasal cavity , lynx , slated , orange , lynx , tarynx. And this part here , then we have branch. Branch. This would be the branch.

This others will be the bronchials. And then the albeoli around. This would be how an albeoli looks like , okay , which are the different capsules that create the entire lung.

So this is one lung and that lung.

So if you look at it , this is like a tree , basically. It 's a tree with all its branches and they absorb light and they give air. This is exactly the same structure. I explained today that where we are breathing in is air , but air is not something complete.

It 's not air. Air is basically the conjunction of many things that leave around us. And this is that air is composed by a lot of gases , a lot of chemicals , but also there is dust around. There are particles.

There are bacteria. Micro.

So viruses. There are chemical composers. There are so many things in the air that air is not just air. It 's the conjunction of many things to get.

So what the respiratory system does is to feel trait. It 's a filter for the air.

So all the heavy things that are out there can be processed and does n't reach the main of the only.

So the first one gets here and the most heavy ones are trapped by the focus. Focus trapped all the things that enters this zone and then is expelled outside if seeing or with the focus or all these things outside. And if not in the lynx , it is also processed by this libre , which goes straight to the digestive system to be excreted.

So then it goes through the vocal cords , trachea and then starts to be absorbed by the vol , which is the one that absorbs the tiny ones.

Remember that there is around 70 % of nitrogen in the air and 21 % of oxygen in the air.

So we are reaching the oxygen because it helps us to keep the energy inside of our body. How? Because the oxygen does the process in the cells through the vol , they go into the blood and through the blood. The oxygen gets in touch with the cells and the cells starts to use this oxygen to produce an oxidation.

It oxygen , I do n't know , the word in English , oxidized , oxidized , oxidized , oxidized , oxidized , which term do you use in English for that understanding? Oxides?

Okay. Last? No , it 's not the one I 'm looking for. Oxides?

Yeah. Oxides? , thank you.

So , oxidized the things that the cells does n't need.

So the cells does n't waste energy on trying to clean themselves. The air is in charge of that cleaning.

So the air oxidized all the things that we do n't need and send it back again to the the the torrent of the blood and like the carbon dioxide and it goes outside of the body. , again.

So this is why the oxygen basically helps the body to maintain their storage of energy purging the the body.

So remember that oxygen , this 21 % of oxygen is not , , does n't come exactly from trees and , , and in the rainforest or the forest. , this , , this oxygen was created and fill up the hand that atmosphere of our planet around 25 23 , , 100 million years ago , 23 , 100 million years ago. When the feet of plants started to fill up the oceans doing photosynthesis. , by the process of photosynthesis , the plants uses the nitrogen and carbon.

They absorb the , , this chemical components and they release the oxygen because they do n't need them , okay. They need the oxygen for for anything to do photosynthesis.

So they storage the carbon and they release the oxygen.

So this is why we the animals , , started to use the oxygen for our energy so we can move. Hmm. Because we , we could n't do photosynthesis. We ate the plants.

But we need to move according to that.

So that 's why we , , uses the oxygen to restore the energy and the time and our cells so we can move forward. Hmm. Even if we today , , believe that the oxygen comes from the trees , , of course that it comes from trees , but most of it comes from the oceans. Because of feet of lantern.

Since millions of years ago , they produce the huge amounts of oxygen that we use in our , hmm. , so most of it is produced when they die in the , in the , in the , in the , in the , in the , , Antarctic Ocean and the , and the Arctic Ocean.

So there is released all the , the huge amounts of oxygen to , , to the , , to the atmosphere.

So when we think about , , all the oxygen , we have to think also about the oceans.

So remember this , of course that trees are important. We should not , , , , ca n't the trees , we should not do what we are doing in the world with the trees with the rainforest. We have to protect the , the trees because they not only , , give oxygen to us , they also control the temperature of the planet and so on. , but it 's important to know to that when we are using the , when we are increasing the heat of the planet , just if , if the oceans , one degree more of temperature , the feet of lantern can die.

Because they are really sensible like , sensitive like , , like the corals , okay.

So if they start to , if the ocean , to get heat for half degree or one degree more , is the algae , the , , the , the , the plant and the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the that die , that a fit plantain that dies.

So being objective with this , we can live without trees , but we can not live without fit plantain.

So once we understand from where it comes , the oxygen , we breathe , why we breathe and what it does inside of us , the breathing , let 's understand the most bigger picture of what is breathing in our life.

So we can get the universal point of this.

So now we can picture this image from the entire cosmos. The air we breathe is like the entire universe.

So we have a lot of nitrogen , which is the essence of information in the universe. And then we have the oxygen , which is like the light beings , the spirits. And they are here free , but mostly they are connected to the carbon.

So a dark being. The dark being , the carbon , it connected to the oxygen is like the gene yang of the universe , the manifestate and the subtillate plants.

So they live together as one.

So now we can understand this from a different point of view. Imagine that this here , this body , is that geometrical aspect of the universe. And then around the air is the information of the cosmos.

So the nitrogen is kind of the most important data that surrounds us all the time. That goes through us all the time , flourishing everything. Then the oxygen are the light beings with the carbon , the dark beings. That they will go inside of the geometry with the purpose.

So when they get inside , they will go through different dimensions. Going through different levels to understand to go through the process of understanding who they are , what they are going to become. And they go through warm holes in the universe around here. And from that they arrive to worlds.

And in this world , these beings , the dark ones and the light ones , they get inside of the currents of history of these worlds that goes into bodies that we call cells. And when those spirits go into the bodies of the cells , they start to clean the body of karma , given the energy like we call Dharma.

So they take back the karma as a process of learning and they give it back again through the same system outside in the air of the cosmos as data. And then they take back the energy.

Okay , is the arabia records? From this , we can understand that our respiratory system , our respiratory system is basically how the universe is processing all this , processing all these souls and beings and data and information that goes inside of us , incarnates in the cells that we call the bodies , processed through karma and Dharma , all the history , and then goes back to the source.

So basically , every time that we breathe , is kind of like a nage for the universe.

So this happens in many worlds , every time , every time that we breathe , thousands of cells dies and thousands of cells are born , every time we breathe.

So every time we do that , we fill up with energy and information with souls and spirits , every one of our cells of our world.

So the universe expands , the long-success , and this has a limit. The limit is the diaphragm. Here is an elastic tissue that it will expand when the spirits come and born in the planets , and then it contracts again , sending them back to the universe. Like this is the end.

You have to start reset again.

So this process that is so tiny , it is like exactly like if in every inhalation , we are living 2,000 years of history , and then in the excavation , we are living 2,000 more.

So all this process of time that has happened was a history for our body.

So now every time that we take a breath , we will think about it.

So the people that smoke , the people that does n't know how to breathe , you have to learn how to do it. Because now you can ask yourself , what are you bringing to the world , inside of your universe? What information are you bringing to every one of yourselves , of the beings that live within you?

## Q&A

So when we , for example , ask to the universe or God , why are you bringing this reality to us?

## Guided Meditation

So we have also to think about what are we bringing to the world? And remember always , do n't breathe through your mouth. Your mouth has been done for eating. It 's connected with another tube going down.

So breathing through the mouth is basically a need , a need of air , like when you are healing or trying to , to take something for release or something like this.

Okay?

So in that moment , yes , but normally when you are trying to be in harmony , the nose , only the nose is the one that hurts you to be in harmony.

Okay?

Remember also that it 's important to know that we usually breathe with this part when we do that. And this is not good. We have to breathe and to feel the respiration , kind of in this stomach , in the abs , okay? Below here.

So we do it much more , complete the entire process , relaxing. We have to learn to breathe again like a baby to this constant proper respiration.

So now , remember , that system brings us to another one. In the air , we have many things , not only oxygen. We have parasites , microbes. We have bacteria , virus , many dark beans.

So let 's go into this system. This take us to the immune system. Why I call them the , the dark beans. Not because they are , but because they are , they are tools that help everything to evolve in a very push way.

To understand this , the dark beans are not that beans , okay? Dark beans are helpful in the process of evolution. They help the beans to evolve. They help in the transformation of everything.

So they are not that , okay? When they become bad , when we are not able , or we are not in the mood of change.

So they were made for change.

So when they come and push us , we do n't like it. And that 's why we interpret it. That 's why we interpret it that they are bad. But saying this is like saying that water is bad because they are names.

Water is no bad. It 's just that the way in which I found the water in that moment , it was horrible , but this does n't mean that the ocean or the bad or the water is not , okay? Immune system. Let 's try to understand how this begins.

It 's not for defense at the beginning. This system was made for evolution. And for this we have to understand the beginning of this. The nature is not fighting itself.

It 's not something that is trying to kill something out. Nature looks for symbiosis. Symbiosis is that basically everything lives in harmony all together as one. Which means that nothing in nature was done against nothing.

Basically everything that appears is just to control the balance between each one of the parts. This is what symbiosis means that everything appears in order to control the quantity of the things and the use of things. This is like , when we go to , Sorry. To the video that we spoke yesterday to the endocrine system , we will know that homestead is the system was designed in order to find this balance between all the parts.

So nature does exactly the same. Nature is finding symbiosis which is all lives together. And by this , the systems evolve into ways that they can take benefit from the outside. And they can improve one to another , exchange in energy and transcluding.

So to understand the system , we can picture this in this way. The immune system is like , It 's like a production of cells or chemical elements that absorbs one information. Retain the information , understand the information and then it shares it with all the other cells. Because it says , I have a new environment , there is something outside that I do n't understand.

So I have to get this information on the stomach myself and then share with others so they know how to live in this new environment.

So as a simple example , we can say that you and your entire family are moving to a new country where they speak another language. And you and nobody gets anything.

So what you do is to go to this country with this family. They do n't get anything , but you decide to study the language. You take the books , you read the books , you understand the language , you study it all. And then once you get it inside , you look into your family and you share the language and you teach the language to them.

So they can move properly in this new country.

So now take this image in your head and recognize that once you learn how to live in that country. Not only you survive in that country , but also you can exchange and share with the people of that country.

So when we bring it into biology , you will understand that inside of you , you have more bacteria , parasites and viruses than cells. In your body right now , you have much more viruses and bacteria than even cells. Because through thousands of years , we started to know how to combine how to exchange with this environments. And we started to know how to live with them.

So as you see , the immunological immune system is not fighting against something outside. It 's trying to understand something from the outside.

So now imagine this , that eventually sometimes there are some of these viruses and bacteria that you have no idea that they exist.

So you live quietly and your body has no clue of them around.

So imagine that you live with your family in this new country , or properly living perfectly. And how would you feel that if one night you are eating all together , laughing , sharing and suddenly from the window door everywhere , ten people start to get inside of the house and they start to eat the food. And they do n't like the door , so they throw it through the window and they put their bed there and stay at home and you do n't know them. How would you feel?

So of course that the body will feel invaded by these beings that are very aggressive , get inside.

So the first thing that the body , the family will do in order to. Say them out is to try to make the environment the house as much uncomfortable as possible for these invaders. What they does the first thing they do is to. Turn on the heat of the house so much heat that they can feel in comfortable.

So they would say like it 's too much hot here. I 'm filled this see let 's go from here because we have no idea how to survive it 's not comfortable to stay here so fever.

So fever is not caused by the virus. The fever is caused by the organism the body trying to make to feel uncomfortable. The. The virus or the bacteria.

So there would be two types of people inside this house. One that we 'll say that we 'll take a stick and we 'll start to heat the people for them to get out. Go away. And there 's another one that we 'll sit and try to speak with them to tell them who are you why are you here from where you come from.

In the first case the person that receives that that starts to hit them it will it will receive feedback.

So it will be very. Very hurt , okay , because maybe he can kill someone or he can kick them away , but he will end up really , really. Terrible , okay. There he exhausted and in the second case.

The person that speaks and the first one is done them. We 'll take longer to take them out of the house. But now that person will know exactly how to treat them.

So eventually if someone else comes again. In the same situation he will know how to treat that person and maybe give them. What they need and be much more cordial.

So in the first case the one that was heating the people end up so hurt so bad. That if new people come it will die because it can not face another fight. It 's already hurt. But in the second case the person that spoke it took a long time for him to understand.

But anyway , it will help. It wo n't lose energy , okay , for them to. If someone else comes it would n't lose energy so he knows already how to do them. The image of the next example would be.

The other example would be that suddenly someone from the outside is. Is realizing that there 's people invading houses around that there are people. Invading different houses. And so these people from the outside they pick some of this in the haters and kill them.

And when they kill them. They throw it through the window of the people that are sitting eating. Spending the night together as a family and suddenly dead bodies. Corps starts to get inside the door and the window from the house.

And the people eating there was like , what is this? Why are we receiving this dead bodies from those?

So there are two , so this is why we call a vaccine. The vaccine is that someone killed the neighbors before they reach your house and they throw it dead through your window.

So there are two ways. There are two ways of making a vaccine. The first one is to throw it by the window. Throw it by the window and you 're eating and something you have dead bodies there.

And you know idea who they are , why they 're there , why someone put them inside of your house. No idea.

So that would be the first one. In the second case , they throw the dead bodies through the window , but they have a note. In the note , they say they explain these are thieves that are in dating houses. And before they reach your house , we send them here.

They are coming from this place. They are doing this. They want to do that.

So you can understand what are they. In the first case , no note , just the dead body. You have no clue of how to defend yourself because you have no clue about who these people are.

So if someone gets inside of your home , you will start all again because you have no clue of anything. But in the second case , when the people did all the stuff they know exactly what are they from where they come from and all these things.

So in the person that received this dead body , can understand , oh , now I get it.

So now I know how to protect myself.

Okay. In the first case , when they throw the dead bodies through the window , is what is what we are leaving today. While we are leaving today with the coronavirus virus , we are receiving dead bodies in our bodies. In order to know exactly this in this , what you , in major , you need at least five years of study of where they come from , how to treat them and so on.

So you need a long time and we are having vaccines in just one year and a half.

So this means that we are having information inside our bodies that we do n't know what they really are and they are throwing dead bodies and many of the things inside of our houses that we have no clue of what they are. Talking about the immunological system. The vaccines , the vaccines are setting inside of us information that we have to interpret it. Is it a body that must interpret it information?

The vaccines does n't heal you. Vaccines does n't provoke any disease. What really happens is how your body can interpret it or understand what you are putting inside your body.

So the vaccine is the information of the virus. It 's just that. But every human has a different immunological system prepared for different things.

So this is why it 's not that one vaccine can heal you or a vaccine can heal you. It depends in what you eat and how you , how you , how you can access the things from the outside. It depends on how you are.

Okay.

So the idea of this is that. The virus , the , the , the , the immunological system is unique for , is unique for every human being. It 's different from every human being.

So it 's not that the vaccines will kill you or the vaccines will. Will save you. It 's just that the , the , the , the , the vaccines actually is giving you the virus information of the virus.

So you can.

So you can process inside that information. And if you do n't know how to handle that information inside , if you do n't interpret it that information inside with your own immunological system , you wo n't be able to. You wo n't be able to handle it to handle that information. That 's why you can get sick or you can heal or whatever.

So most of our of us humans may be the 80 % of humanity. We can handle with our immunological system. We can handle the virus. Maybe as a flu.

And maybe the 20 other percent of humanity ca n't handle it at all. They would be , they would be very , they would suffer a lot.

So mainly what what is happening is that the quarantine is trying to protect us because we do n't know how to. How many hospitals we would need we do n't have the , the system to contain so many so many people that can get sick. But actually it 's our immunological system that one that interpreted the information of the vaccine.

So one of the main things that we have to. To do with our , you know , our life is to. To heal our immunological system. We have to take care of what we eat , how we leave in which environment we leave.

What I 'm saying is that we have to. To empower our immunological system and that does n't mean that. All the bodies can. Can hope.

The. The. The. The immunological system.

Some people need the vaccines in order to help themselves because they do n't have the , for the vaccine. We 'll not be able to check that.

So this strength in order to. In order to do it by themselves , and we have to respect that , and also remember. That.

Remember , also that. We should not it start. A war against vaccination , We should not start a war against. And vaccines because it help people.

Many people is alive because of vaccines.

Some people need them so do n't start a war against doctors , medicine , and science. The conflict here is that there are people that make business with this. That 's the only problem. The business.

So just pay attention to the real conflict and not against the science and medicine.

Okay.

So for example , I 'm myself. I do n't want to vaccine myself. I do n't like that. I do n't ever vaccine myself because I rather trust my own immunological system.

So I do n't like to put vaccines on me. I want to do this by myself.

Okay.

So it 's my choice. But I can not tell other people for them to not vaccine because each person has their own immunological system and you know if you trust it or not.

So do n't force others to do something against. Do n't force others to vaccine or not to vaccine. Each one has to know its own immunological system to trust its own immunological system.

So I want to speak about this because longer because this affects all of us of course today and I want to say this that this is not white or black.

So this is what takes us in this week. That we have to understand that we should not push others to do something against their will , whether it is vaccine or not.

So we have to understand that we have to know ourselves. First of all we have to know our system and from there to take the decision if we want to do that or not. But it 's not or one or the other. Is your own responsibility?

For the system not to force you to be fascinated because it 's your right in your body.

So once that this let 's go to the alignment. I know that this gives that a for for a long chat but I can be here for hours.

## Daily Practice Elements

So so I just suspect that this is useful for you to dive your own path ways. And then I bridge today is okay. The statement for today is I am a channel of communication. The core for today is the ex-curatory system.

## Guided Meditation

This system that releases the bodies waste is constituted by the kidneys , bladder , breathe , colon , regnum and amos. All the liquid of the bodies processed by the kidneys to absorb what 's necessary and discard all the other heavy elements that are harmful to the organism. This way they are sent to the bladder that stores this waste as your eye before being expelled through the uradhram. The same way all the scarred material by this small intestine is expelled through the large intestine where it 's completed to be ex-squitted physically by the regnum and amos.

The system would be compared to the implosion of a galaxy , black holes where everything is recycled. Sit comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate precisely in your breathing. Deep breath and become aware of the body that I inhabit. Slowly I take a deep breath and start to expand the body , stretching , warning.

Moving every joint and softly to begin to carry this and massage every part of it. Touching every symptom of your body , recognizing all of it. I allow myself to feel the body , those parts of it that can feel uncomfortable the parts where I can feel pleasure. I know it 's one of them.

I 'm going to try to touch the body. I 'm going to stretch and start to touch , carry my body. As if it is the body of my lover , the person that I love. I carry some of the deep , the face and the pinch part of it.

I allow myself to feel the pleasure of touching the body without and thing , no thing. And I take a deep breath and start to relax the entire body. Let 's move the head , fall down , the jaw , shoulders , yards. If it 's necessary , I let the jaw hang from the head opening the mouth of the arms from the shoulders.

Now , I take a deep breath and this time become an aware of every step of it. I breathe through the nose , feel in the air , get in the in through the lynx. Going to the tractor , the branch , the elderly , going through all the lynx and side to the lungs. Until I feel the oxygen going through the veins , to every one of the cells in my body , bringing this energy , cleaning , everybody.

I feel the process of this light being since side of me. Clean , they say all the things that they 've purged. Again , through the arteries , to the elderly , the branch , the trachea , the lynx and exile through the nose. Repeat this process once and again , being aware that you breathe in , inhalt , you hold the air in this trapeze side and then you breathe out , exile.

I recognize in my breathing how thousands hundreds of cells are born or many others die. How all this process flourishes every world inside of me. I can realize that every breath I take is a history in all the beings within my inner universe. I recognize that in this process of breathing , the inside and the outside can communicate.

I recognize the restoration , just debris between the universe and the cosmos. I recognize the most in the entire universe in each breath. I recognize inside of me this power that I have to keep me alive , that helped me recognize the environment , to adapt , to handle a recitation in this world. I honor the new system.

I honor every white cell that protects me. Every angel , live warrior that lives within me , protect me in the path of evolution. I am the channel of communication between the universe and the cosmos. I am the channel of communication.

I am the channel of communication. I am the channel of communication. I am the channel of communication. I take a deep breath and each one of the times come back here and now.

I take this energy and we put it into the water and we pair it on the seats that we have sold. Thank you everybody for being another day here and I always see you tomorrow at the same time.
