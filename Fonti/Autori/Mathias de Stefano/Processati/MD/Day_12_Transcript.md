## Overview

On the twelfth day of alignment, we continue the emotional week by working with the third eye chakra. We use all the energy and emotions to activate the consciousness and recognize that we can be the creator of our thoughts, not the thoughts creating us. Today's focus is on coherence and integration, accepting and seeing the parts we have in our shadows as well as in our light.

The vibration "Hae" combines "H" (history and life) with "Ae" (consciousness and the mind). Today's statement is "I Am the Life of Thoughts," emphasizing our power to create our own thoughts and free ourselves from our beliefs. The code is exhalation in the process of transcendence—the universe decides to free itself, launching into the deepest dream where neutrality becomes nothingness. Every potential, pattern, idea, or dream ceases to exist, and it finds freedom in its mind, giving itself the possibility to marvel again in a new sight.

This session addresses the experience of feeling connected to the network and feeling what others in the collective are experiencing. We learn that as we balance our own energies through daily alignments, we begin to move in harmony with the network, like tuning forks vibrating together. This is the path toward planetary consciousness.

## Core Teaching

### Coherence and Shadow Work

In order to be coherent, we have to accept and see the parts we have in our shadows as well as in our light. We are not going to judge anything we feel or anything that helps us. We are just going to integrate it. Coherence is not just about being coherent within ourselves; it is also about being coherent in the network.

### The Network of Tuning Forks

We humans are like tuning forks. Each one of us is constantly vibrating at different frequencies, moving in different directions. As we start to make the balance through the alignments every day, the movement starts to balance and find harmony until we all start to move in coherence together.

Imagine all these tuning forks vibrating differently. Suddenly, we start to make the balance, and the movement starts to harmonize. This is what we are building—a network. We don't have to be afraid of being connected or losing our individuality. When one tuning fork is moving harder or more intensely, the other ones help it reach the balance again. This is part of being in the symphony toward planetary consciousness.

### Feeling the Network

It is normal to start feeling what other people in the network are feeling. This doesn't mean you are losing yourself or that the emotions are not yours. Every emotion is within you. Everything you feel is yours. What we are doing by feeling the emotions of the network is helping to balance the collective energy.

Just as we can feel the lower vibrations in the network, we can also be pushed to higher vibrations if the whole network is connected to reach enlightenment or high vibration. This helps us understand that we are constantly connected. Our mind thinks we are disconnected from everything, but we are not. We are constantly connected. We are not just individuals; we are part of something bigger. We are all connected constantly.

### Realizing the Connection

What we are doing is feeling that connection and realizing that everything outside is constantly moving and creating our insight. If we become aware of this connection, we can be the one also helping to change the network. This is what we are practicing—recognizing our power to influence and balance the collective field.

### Cleaning the System

One of the things many people have been experiencing is feeling emotions that are not correlative to what is happening in the present moment. For example, feeling really weird or off even when nothing in particular is happening. This is because we are working with the cleaning of the system. Because we are cleaning everything that was hidden and stuck in our self, in our being, in our body, our soul starts to purge. It starts to clean up.

Just feel it. Allow yourself to feel it and express it into the outside so it can be used. Let all these things go out. We are used to repressing all these emotions, but what we are trying to do is to let it all out. That is the most important thing.

### Creating Our Own Thoughts

The main teaching for today is that we can be the creator of our thoughts, not the thoughts creating us. By activating and empowering our acknowledgment, we recognize "I can be the one creating the thoughts." By this way, we become free from our beliefs. We can free ourselves from our beliefs. We can create our own thoughts.

### Transcendence and Letting Go

The code of today teaches us that the universe, with the certainty of being all, decides to free itself from itself. It launches itself into the deepest dream where neutrality becomes nothingness. Every potential, brutality, path, pattern, idea, or dream ceases to exist. The universe finds freedom in its mind, giving itself the possibility to marvel again in a new sight.

This means that the universe also dies. It leaves everything into transcendence. Nothing that I have experienced or lived is really mine. I let it all go. When it comes to nothingness, to the void, it takes again the possibility to breathe, to create a new sight, to create a new reality. It is by leaving everything away—the patterns, everything—that you are able to create any reality.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Look for a comfortable position. If you can position yourself in the tetrahedron shape, do so.
2. Just relax and let it flow.
3. Remember to always try to be seated, not laying down. We are working with the coherence of heaven and earth—the balance of both.
4. The tetrahedron position: your back straight, you cross your legs, put your arms straight, and your hands resting on your knees.
5. Start by caressing the skin along all your body to let the nervous system know we are going to work with the energy.
6. Focus on your breathing, caressing with the tip of your fingers all your body softly.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Start to relax your body, letting the weight of your shoulders, arms, and hands fall down.
2. Focus on your breathing. Take a deep breath.
3. With your imagination, go with the oxygen through your lungs, your heart, the blood toward the organs and muscles.
4. Become aware of your body.
5. Take a deep breath and recognize the hottest part of your body.
6. Recognize that part of your body and become aware that this heat is where all your emotions today are stuck, locked in your body.
7. Without judgment, just allow yourself to feel the emotion. It doesn't matter if the emotion is low or high; just recognize it. Just allow yourself to feel it without touching it.
8. Become aware of the energy coming out from your body, creating the energy of your aura today.
9. Without judgment, without thinking, watch the color of the energy. Recognize it. Feel it.
10. Take time to allow your mind to bring the ideas of everything you have done today—the emotions, the feelings you have had through your day.
11. Try to think about the emotions you had from the very moment you opened your eyes today, when you woke up, all the situations you have lived, and the emotions you have felt in each one of them.
12. Identify the emotion that is common to the day. It doesn't matter if you don't know the name of the emotion; allow yourself to feel it. Recognize it.
13. Recognize that this emotion is the one your higher self chose to be used as fuel to activate your third eye today.
14. Take a deep breath and begin to exhale softly through the mouth.
15. Breathe in by the nose, hold it, and breathe out softly through the mouth.
16. With your hands or imagination, breathing this way, bring the emotion and the colors around your head.
17. Imagine the energy and emotion organizing itself in the shape of a circle, a wheel around your head.
18. Recognize the emotion as the fuel for your third eye, for the energy that creates the thoughts.
19. Recognize that by activating and empowering your acknowledging, you can be the one creating the thoughts, not the thoughts creating you.
20. Start to make the wheel spin around your head, activating the energy of your third eye in the core of your brain.
21. Pronounce the vibration "Hae" to activate the seed. Exhale the sound of the activation: "Hae."
22. Keep pronouncing it once and again.
23. Recognize the activation of the potential: "I can, I can, I can be the creator of my thoughts."
24. Affirm: "By this way I become free from my beliefs. I can free myself from my beliefs. I can create my own thoughts."
25. As you pronounce, feel the wheel spinning faster and faster, becoming the fuel for the chakra, the third eye.
26. The third eye is enlightened brighter by the light of your consciousness.
27. Expand toward every direction the light of your consciousness.
28. Affirm: "I activate the life within you. I Am the Life in Thoughts. I Am the Life in Thoughts. I Am the Life in Thoughts."
29. Watch all the energy and the emotion consumed by the brightest light of your third eye.
30. Affirm: "I Am the Light in Thoughts."
31. Take your hands to the height of the third eye and start to pull the energy from the third eye toward all the directions around your body, going down below your feet, surrounding you.
32. See and feel the energy of the third eye surrounding your aura, your being, in every direction.
33. Discharge all the energy, the light, the tension toward the ground.
34. Take your hands to your heart and take a deep breath.
35. Affirm: "I Am the Life in Thoughts."

### Closing

1. Softly from your heart, start to caress your whole body with the tips of your fingers, coming back to your body.
2. Open your eyes, stretch the body, and yawn.
3. This way we have settled the energy of the "I Am" through the emotion in the third eye.
4. As always, take a moment to rest, discharge the energy by walking, and allow yourself to assimilate the information through resting.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Reflect on the emotions you have felt throughout the day and recognize them as fuel for your consciousness. Practice creating your own thoughts rather than being controlled by them. Observe the moments when you feel connected to the network and honor that connection as part of your path toward planetary consciousness.

### Applying This Teaching

When you notice yourself being controlled by your thoughts or beliefs, pause and remember: "I can be the creator of my thoughts." Use the emotions you feel as fuel to activate your third eye and expand your consciousness. Release the need to hold onto patterns and allow yourself to let everything go, creating space for new realities to emerge.

## Q&A

### Q: What does it mean to feel connected to the network?

It means you are starting to feel what other people in the collective are experiencing. This is normal as we balance our energies through the alignments. We are like tuning forks vibrating together, finding harmony.

### Q: Am I losing myself if I feel others' emotions?

No. Every emotion is within you. Everything you feel is yours. Feeling the network's emotions means you are helping to balance the collective energy, not losing your individuality.

### Q: Why am I feeling emotions that don't match what's happening in my life?

This is because we are cleaning the system. Everything that was hidden and stuck is now purging and coming out. Just feel it and let it go.

### Q: How can I become the creator of my thoughts?

By activating and empowering your acknowledgment through the practice. Recognize that you have the power to create your thoughts rather than being controlled by them. This brings freedom from your beliefs.

### Q: What is coherence in the context of this practice?

Coherence means accepting and seeing all parts of yourself—shadows and light—and integrating them without judgment. It also means being coherent within the network, not just within yourself.

### Q: What does it mean that "neutrality becomes nothingness"?

It means that by letting go of all patterns, potentials, and ideas, you reach a state of nothingness where you are free to create any reality. Transcendence requires releasing everything.

### Q: How does the network help us reach higher vibrations?

When one person's vibration is off, the network helps bring them back into balance. Conversely, if the whole network is connected to reach enlightenment, everyone is lifted to higher vibrations together.

### Q: What should I do with emotions that come up during the cleaning process?

Feel them, express them, and let them out. We are no longer repressing emotions—we are releasing them so they can be transformed and used constructively.
