## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So I hope that everyone is okay , everyone is fine. Working the detachment with this full moon of today. And then we go all the intensity that we have been going through in cancer.

So let 's go to our day related to the heart in the physical wake-up. And where do we go? We go to the concept of elemental. For sure , that when I mention the word elemental for all the people that has been going through a path of spirituality , the first thing that pop up in your mind is about all these beings that from other dimensions , we can mention a company as through our process of development , which are the theories , and elements of health , and other elements that are in the elemental world that we relate with our spiritual awakening , a company to help us evolve.

Also , when we say elemental , we can relate that with elements.

So the elements of reality , the elements of nature , that are the basis for all the rest that exist.

So we can have basic , the first one , the either being the one that allows everything to exist , the essence that from where everything is emerging. And of course , from that we have the fire , the water , the earth , and the air. But for elements with the fifth element , which is the ether.

So those are the different beings that we usually relate with the elements in the spiritual path in our awakening process of consciousness. But we will try to figure out what is exactly an element.

So for sure , you all know the BC , okay?

So the BC in the Roman times was not thought actually as we know today. There was no some letters were not used , okay?

So they did n't exist.

So but they learned the alphabet in the alphabet in two steps. Like for example , they learned from BC , the lava , and then a second line , okay?

So in Roman times , they even started the BC through BC because this is a thinnestian way of ordering the letters.

So the letters were like this , the BC like that was from Middle East and they just used it in Middle East and Greece. But the Romans , they used it a different way.

So this letter were organized in a different way and the Romans started the BC from here from the L.

So this is not the beginning of the BC for the Romans. What are the first letters of the BC in Roman times? Element.

So why do we call it alphabet? We call it alphabet because of alphabet , which are the first letters of the Greek BC. And we have the BC , BC , okay? If we say alphabet because of alphabet , how the Romans would say to the alphabet , element to them.

Okay?

So what is an element , an element is describing the different parts , the different letters of the language , the different aspects of the whole.

So elements , the elements are basically the parts of something of a whole.

So I have a square here and if I have here in square , a square has eight elements for the letters , for dots , 36 and four inches.

So we have eight elements for edges for dots , notes , which are the elements of the square. As the letters are the elements of a language.

So what are the elements of existence? The elements of existence is basically the different tiny little parts that creates what we think.

So when we say elements are the things that shape everything , the shape the reality.

So for example , we have in nature , we have mountains , sea , rivers , wind , volcanoes , but we can summarize all of that in basic elements that that possible. For example , water is the element for the rivers , the ocean , sea , earth is the element for the deserts for the mountains , for the lining and volcanoes , the fire and for the wind , the air. But also we can go , sign your and sign your to say what are the elements of water. The elements of water are to atoms of , to atoms of hydrogen and one oxygen.

And the elements of fire is the energy spread with atoms of carbon and the elements of the air are neon oxygen hydrogen , nitrogen and so on.

So we can have all these little tiny elements that shape the rest.

So everything the reality everything that exists is basically different elements create a whole.

So everything that is constituted by different elements as we have said these days. An atom for example has different elements that constitute an atom which are the elements of proton , neutron and electron , which are the elements of an atom.

So in order to , so everything the reality is constituted by different elements.

So in order to understand who we are , we have to know the elements that makes us possible. Here is when we go to look for elemental consciousness.

So what would be the elemental consciousness? Elemental consciousness would be to understand that we as a whole are package of different elements.

So all these different elements that that constitute us are sometimes we have no clue about them.

So in order to have consciousness about these elements consciousness about ourselves we have to be conscious about our elements. We have to acknowledge about the elements that constitute us.

So for sure in our spiritual path we would speak at first about elemental beings. Then we have the five elements. Then we have the chemical elements. Then the atomic elements.

And of course the universal elements.

So the elemental beings are a 4D reality that we can call archetypal atom. Archetypal data.

So the five elements are elements from the 3D that are added to the world existence.

So then we have the chemical elements. Also in the 3D that we will call the real basis. And then we have the atomic elements that we will divide in the fifth dimension between particles and weights. And then we have the universal elements that we will put in the sixth dimension related to essential and ball.

Can you see better there? Let 's go to see. Each one of these parts. The universal elements first.

The universe is a whole cosmos that is constituted by different elements. What are the essential universal elements? We have them here by vibration , energy and matter. These three and all the trainees coming from them like sound , light , form , love with them.

We 'll all those trainees are these elements that constitute the soul of the universe.

So what are the laws of the universe? The elements , the elemental universe laws. We have spoke about it which are mentality , correspondence , vibration , rhythm , cause and effect , polarity and generation. These are the law elements of the universe.

So I would like to explain something because I know there 's a lot of people who have someone like God , organize all this , someone outside trying to roll all these kind of things. I did n't say anything new , so do n't worry. I just have to change the network. Can you see better?

I have this square here. What is making the square beam there? Is the thing that allows a square beam?

So the reason why a square is here is because there are four edges and four dots that are connected it.

So the thing that is hold of the square is basically these four lines and four dots. If I erase this line here , there 's no square.

So the reason why this square is here is because it 's our holding it to be there. Our holding it to be there.

So this means that everyone , each one of it 's aspects like for example an atom , there is no one , there is no mind outside positioning every atom where it is supposed to be. There is no one saying now this electron goes here around this atom , around this proton , aside this neutron. It is organized by itself by law. It is organized by itself and it creates the law as it is organized in itself.

So the laws of the universe are elemental for the universe , but just because they know how to manage itself like nature itself.

So it 's not that there is someone outside like a god organizing all these aspects to be like this. Are the different aspects the thing.

So as you have seen the elements of the universe are the essential three niches and the laws of which are the same laws of the universe.

So then we have the atomic elements that we are in spoke about them yesterday. And the fifth dimension because they are able to be whatever they want so they can become particles or waves as they please.

So what are the elements of an atom , the different particles and waves. Frequencies , electrons , protons , neutrons , quartz , quantum and all the subtopic realm.

So remember that something that I forgot to say that the essential elements of the universe are organized in fact just of trinities.

So we have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12.

So we can start to count and it creates mathematics.

So now notes of the music sounds all of that are the basis of the elements of the universe.

Okay.

So now the chemical elements , why the chemical elements are so important for us because there are the basis of our third three dimensional world. Besides we are multidimensional beings , we have decided to exist in this reality of the third dimension.

So when we speak about the third dimension , we have to know about the elements that constitute this reality that we choose , which are the chemical elements.

So the chemical elements are the basis of our existence here.

So the reality , the atomic reality that constitute our existence.

Okay.

So this means that we have to acknowledge and know about them.

So in the blog , I would recommend for you to go and read the blog today because there I explain about the chemical elements and how they are organized. There are organized , I can , they affect , okay , in our life and why do we need them.

So why is important to understand the chemical elements here? Because of course I do n't like chemistry , I do n't like it , I was never good on that. But what we acknowledge through the chemical elements is that all these tiny little real basis of our existence are the ones that we have to know about. Are the ones that moved entirely our reality?

So everything that we touch , what we help each , what we drink , everything that we feel , every emotion , when we feel depressed , when we feel happy , anything that we feel is basically controlled by the chemistry.

So when we understand the elements of the chemistry , we can also acknowledge that that inner potential that everyone is talking about. When people say , our is within you , you have to go inside to look for the inner power. Well , that power is inside the atom , the atoms that compose the chemical elements. When we understand those chemical elements , we know exactly what elements we need in order to change our emotions or how we feel are our connection with environment.

So it 's because of that that acknowledge chemical elements can improve our understanding of ourselves of who we are. This is why we call that elemental consciousness. To have elemental consciousness is become aware to acknowledge that all these chemical elements are constituting the constitute what we are , what we feel , what we express. That 's our inner potential.

These chemical elements are the real basis that allow the five elements to exist.

So these chemical elements can be divided in gases , in metalloids , metals , in liquids.

So they are divided in where we call the five elements , not exactly the elements , but they embody the elements.

So water , fire , air , there are kind of the families where all these elements leave.

So all these elements are the different children that are creating these groups of five great families that exist , remember. The chemical elements are real , but the five elements exist.

So the five elements and all the things in nature , they are not real , but they exist.

So this is why when we understand the chemical elements , we can understand the basis of existence.

So in the past , we did n't understand exactly the differences between the chemical elements and its atomic composition.

So that 's why in the past they used to call this alchemy. The alchemy was to understand all the basis of reality through the five elements. That 's why in the past they call it alchemy to the chemistry.

So what are the elemental beings? The elemental beings are beings in the fourth dimension. There are the product of all the data that is born through the existence of the five elements and the interaction of all the chemical elements. All the data , the information that they are expanding and sharing through time by experience through the chemical elements is what we call the archetype of the elemental beings.

We can also say that the chemical elements is data. The five elements that info created by those by that data and the elemental beings are the idea. The transcendental idea born from that information in the fourth dimension.

So for example , we have in the elemental beings and elves.

## Energy Work

So an elf in the fourth is an archetype of someone that indicates near that roots really soft that kind of use arrows in a very good way. They are very soft and subtle.

So elves are the archetype , the idea of something that in the information is related to the air because everything that is related with the elf takes us today the idea of air.

So the information of the elves are encoded in the element air. And what is the data of air? Either gene , neon , nitrogen , oxygen. We can say here that this data in the chemical elements create a network in between each one of the aspects that creates a network of information.

This definition shapes one of the elements. And that element encodes the data of the information becomes a thought and idea at concept that transcends itself becoming an elemental being the archetype of that information. For example , speaking much more in a queries time , we can relate the elements like the binary code. 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 for example.

This are chemical elements of algebra.

So now all these different elements will be translated in information. This information for example will be red. The color red. These elements are the data.

The data turns into infection. Red. And the idea would be the color itself.

## Q&A

So I can see the color. If you have a philosophical question , have you ever touched a color? Can you touch a color? No.

It 's impossible to touch a color. It 's impossible because what is a color? A color is not something that you can touch. A color is just a perception perception of your brain regarding a wavelength of light.

So you only see the color inside. It 's impossible to touch a color. It 's a perception. Can I touch a fairy?

Can I touch a fairy? Can I touch a fairy? It 's impossible. Maybe I can see a fairy.

I can stare at a fairy in the same way as I can see the color red , but I can touch it. Because red does n't exist.

So we enter again into this philosophical thought of our fairy 's real. No. But fairy 's exist. Yes.

So what is elemental consciousness? It 's not to get stuck with the idea or the belief that something exists. But to go way further and beyond to figure out the main elements that make something possible. For example , in my own life , since I was very child , I did n't touch with fairy 's.

Fares were always with me. Teaching me everything , sharing with me everything every day , every time , even until when I was really old and teenager. And even today , I can feel them. Even today , I can perceive them with me in some moments.

And I believe in failures , of course. But I also go deeper to understand why they exist for. To understand that they are just a projection of information , data , that my brain tries to understand as a fairy. In the same way , as when I speak with someone , I have a friend in front of me.

I know that we do n't exist that our bodies are just a hologram of atoms.

So the only thing that exists is atoms. The particles of the atoms.

So my brain has evolved in order to see the person , otherwise I get crazy. If I only see atoms , I would n't be able to believe here. It would be impossible.

So my whole evolution , word A for me to see the person and not to see the atoms that creates the person. In the same way as my brain , per day , that data with a shape of a fairy.

So I believe in failures , even though I know they are not real.

## Daily Practice Elements

So until here , what I explain about this , if you want to know more about theories and dragons and all these elves and different elemental things , look for bibliography because I do n't know about all of them. The vibration today is cool. The statement today is I am the root of hearts. The code today is the node of the solo.

In South Africa , related with the constellation of Scorpio. It 's a comfortable close your eyes and concentrating your breathing.

So I become aware of my entire body , who 's space. I become a couple of the colors , textures , smells. I recognize the texture of the air , calming in to my towards my lungs. My perceived the oxygen running through my veins towards every cell.

I return water to my blood , and every organ , to myself. And become aware of every element , mineral , that shape what I am. I am solving calcium , potassium , stability , all of them being the earth in me. I first the iron of earth , wet in the water of my blood , and inside every cell , reaching every cross.

I find phosphorus , this phosphorus that ignites that eccentricity , the fire of the spirit , it 's fighting with end.

## Guided Meditation

So throughout me , and can perceive the atoms and all its particles , all the magnetic field that constitutes everything that I am. The essence of myself , the ether. I take the breath. I breathe , I can breathe , ignite me , the elements within me.

I experience of each one of them. My fire , I see the dragons , the feelings , the salamanders , the fighting within me. The memories , memories , the waters of my emotions , I am asleep in the voice of my ear , but every breath. And through the ether , I can perceive the divas , angels , but the nerves from me that are me.

From the depth of my passion , I recognize this constant element. And through this recognition , each one of my particles. I acknowledge you , all of them. I can recognize the elements of consciousness.

## Energy Work

Becoming aware , in order to be one , I have to honor each one of the parts that makes me happy. I am old-headed. I am the root of all these elements in my heart , of all of them , community. I am the root of the heart , and the root of the heart.

I am the root of the heart. And I open myself to feel each one of the spirits of the elements in me , of knowledge in myself , one with them. I feel , I feel , I feel , I feel , I feel. I feel , I feel , I feel , I feel.

I feel , I feel , I feel. In Lambda , board should in charge , Alright , once you 're getting up , adding the difference between the investors or investors in the COVID-19 water harmonic , be sure to set your數 in within the lower route to an address and form the data percentage upon from heating rooms , in your regional hardware PoketCraph , I 'd love you all. Collecting all information I 've purchased.

So I 'll accept that this exposure is an interesting being here another day and it 's always See you tomorrow at the same time
