## Introduction

Hello everyone everybody good morning good afternoon good evening to all of you today to bother all the Aries People and Kim dress with a lion why why why welcome to all of you again to the second day of the mental the Mind week of Aries related to the third eye chakra today the topic is the question why so let's go to this question comes from here so now why the question why comes from why that comes from the in the European language remember that yesterday I said that y comes from the word poor well today y comes from Queen why because the letter E in this in European language is the the council ankletic sorry yes the council in clinic is the one that determines the cause of something okay so is the one that is talking about the cause of this thing the reasons of why it happening it is happening something to this thing okay remember that whoa means is the thing the object of the question okay so Qui is the reason why this thing is leaving something experiencing experiencing something so all this is talking about the reason and cause the reason and the cause of something which that would be the origin so this is the reason of why the question why take us to the origin of all things to the beginning of every reality that we know all the things that are here today that we know today has an origin has a recent of existence and the question why is the one that take us to find out all these Origins so the importance of questioning ourselves why is in order to understand the origin of the things that made us be what we are today in the cultures that we have today we have been designed in order to think towards the future because in our third dimension we all know is impossible to go back to the past it's impossible to transform the past and because of this we used to say that we don't have to care about the past we have to create future we have to move forward so we have to put all our will our strength our intentions into the future and this is the reason why we are all the time thinking ahead forward and trying to escape from the past so going towards the future of course that many of us what we do is try to deny the past to go away from the past in order to be able to transform ourselves into something better because we kind of understand the past like an anchor like something that doesn't help us to move forward so for sure by your own experience you can tell that as faster you run to the Future escaping from the past the faster you will live exactly the same mistakes as before in the past so we come back to understand here the line of time as we see our time or the circle of time pass present and future so again to understand this in our society point of view we go from the past to the Future and we are in the present moving ahead towards the future so we cannot go back to the past so we have to let it go to erase the weight of the past so in the moment when we leave the third dimension towards the fourth dimension we understand that the time is much more like a circle in the shape of a spiral than the line so this means that we can never leave the past behind is literally impossible foreign the past here is the structure of repetition so the past is basically this turn here and then it's this turn here and this turn here and this turn here so this means that the past repeats itself constantly maybe in another level of vibration another level of Consciousness but it repeats once and again perhaps the subjects are different perhaps the environment is different but the structure is the same so the base the structure of this is a circle is always a circle maybe the circle is located in this shape or in this shape or in this shape but it will be still the same as an example we can tell grand grandfather grandfather father and son for example so just for you to understand better the system the structure is to be that grandfather sun because my grandfather was also a son of someone my grandfather was a father of someone my grandfather is a great son of someone Okay so the system repeats but the people we have different names living in different countries okay so the environment and the subjects are different but the system is the same it's continuous it's constant okay so this structure is the one that tells me that it doesn't matter what do I do in my life somewhere or some way or another I will come back to the beginning and I keep moving into the next one and the next one and the next one so what does this mean that everything that I do has a system that works like Neko hmm so this system works exactly the same even if we are in the subconscious the unconscious or the conscience it doesn't matter it doesn't change this is like this the only thing that changes really is my attitude according to this structure how it works so now when we are living in one of these circles doing things and suddenly we start to leave things that we don't understand the reason of why they are good or bad for me the question that I start to do is why why so the question why is the one that helps me to find the origin of this constant Loop so now imagine that I am here in this point of this process and I say why I'm here why I'm living this so the question immediately will take me to the first one the one before myself to see it so here is the cause and then I ask why and I go to the next one before why and goes to the next one and so on the question why takes me to a new origin of this system remember that the one that is unconscious doesn't make questions the only one that makes questions is the one that is conscious the one that is conscious doesn't have the answers have all the questions because remember the one that is unconscious is living through the waves of the others is the one that is moved by the positive and the negative trying to sail in between the currents of the Society of the ideas living through the concepts of the others when we start the path of Consciousness for sure you all have been through that the first question you do is why so now this why do we think no sorry why if the Y is the key to be aware do we think that the one that is conscious has all the questions has all the answers and no need to ask why you got the question that I did and repeat again the question because even myself couldn't get it why if the question why is the key for the awareness are we thinking that the one that is awakened has all the answers and doesn't have any reason to ask why again they're the key of being conscious is not to believe that we have the answers to all the origins The Key Of Consciousness is to keep asking why the question why is the one that takes us to the origin to the initiation to the main energy the inertia that moves us forward in order to exist and create and this is why the universe only has one only possible answer for the question why do you know which one it is the last question of the universe to the question why is why not simple this is another question as we have said the questions are the origin of the things the question is the origin of the consciousness the one that is following the consciousness knows exactly that in order to love the answers must love the question even more the wise one knows that the question is the key there's no answer that is bigger than the question so the key to understand for this week and even more today is that nobody has the right answer nobody has the only answer to anything because the only possible answer is the question so you have to keep questioning everything and we have two ways of asking the questioning from the ego and the questioning from the self from the being when we question through the ego is when we are fighting to achieve the question to achieve the answer is when we are judging the other one because we want to put our truth over the others answer when we question through the ego the only thing that we can create in the other one is a reaction for an answer to defend its own Vision instead of making the other doubt and ask a new question when you do the question when you do the question to the other one like why this or why that what you are doing there is to push in the other one to look for an answer to defend itself this is what we usually do all the time we question the other in a way that the other needs to defend its answer and now the question from the being is when you question to the when you question the other in a way that you're trying to show the other person a different way inviting inviting the other person to make another question to doubt to question itself and to look for a better answer as an example from the ego the question why do you do it this way and now from the being why do you think you do it in this way you see the difference is the same question the first one goes against the ego the second one invites the ego to look for a better answer perhaps it seems like Celia the beginning but to learn how to question why opens many different possibilities still instead of wasting energy on the fight and now take your notebook and I invite you to do the task which is to write down all the whys of your life why why why why why why this with that with this there's no need to answer just to the questions okay the vibration for today is Guy the statement for today is I am contemplations vision the code for today is the constellation Vela is the light of the Galaxy representing in the skies the sale of a ship that brings us to our destiny this Stars includes the Guardians of the center of the middle key way eradiating like a lighthouse shows us the why the way within towards finding our light the purpose and Destiny of the journey that is being won and for that its Destiny is Leo so sit comfortable close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing I become aware of the room I find myself in of the body where I am and the breathings and above me I visualize a tiny light a spark my Divine Spark the light of the I am and expand I feel this part coming down to my crown chakra and ignites asking the question why do I believe I breathe and then night this part thank you I feel this part falling down after this explosion shining in the center of my brain expanding its light and by seeing the expansion of this part I activate the question why do I observe I observe expansion and explosion of this Divine Spark breathe I descend this Divine spark to my throat igniting it's Light Within Me and I activate the question why I say why I speak ignite the Divine spark through the question foreign Spark going down to my heart with every breathing this Divine spark starts to ignite in many others to every direction through my heart and I activate the question why do I feel what I feel I do I take a deep breath inside the sand this Divine Spark to my plexus with every breath I start to feel how these Divine spark ignites Within Me activating the spark of my being activating the question why am I as I am foreign descending this Divine Spark to the sacrament I observe the light igniting Within Me and in this slide I activate the question why I do what I do good night I take a deep breath and descend this part to my root chakra I see I feel this part expanding in many Sparks through my genitals and hips and in its light I activate the question why do I have what I have ignite I take a deep breath descending this Divine Spark towards my knees I feel the light of these parts igniting along my legs and I activate the question in me why do I look for what I'm looking for and in night I take a deep breath and I start to the sand this Divine spark towards my feet into my ankles I observe to Divine spark activating its light Within Me and I activate the question why I am going in this path foreign and I start to see all these Divine Sparks in me expanding towards the outside in 19 Delight in me activating the question that leads me to the origin of all things why and in its answer I can contemplate everything why not oh my God I am the vision that contemplates I am the vision that contemplates I am the vision that contemplates I am I am I am take a deep breath and it's one at its own time come back here and now stretch and yawn thank you everybody for being here as always and see you tomorrow at the same time foreign - Generated with https://kome.
