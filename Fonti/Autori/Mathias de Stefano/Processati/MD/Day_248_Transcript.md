## Overview

Today we arrive at the knees chakra of the Mental Week of Aries. The topic is the question **When?**

This day requires us to understand something profound: **All our words for time are actually words for space.**

Understanding "When?" reveals that time doesn't exist as we think it does—that everything is actually the **eternal present**, and what we call "past" and "future" are really different **locations** in space.

This teaching connects etymology, quantum physics, and consciousness to show us why we say **"here and now."**

---

## Why Understanding Etymology Matters

### Healing Through Understanding Origins

When we do healing work, we go to the **past**—to understand our parents, grandparents, ancestors.

When we understand the point of view and reality of our ancestors, we can understand our life today and what we can do towards the future.

**With words and concepts, it's the same.**

### Etymology is Ancestral Healing for Language

Understanding where words come from helps us **rethink the concepts** we use to change our future.

If we don't know correctly where words come from, we make mistakes when heading to the future.

### We Are Holistic Beings

Some people say: "I just need to feel, I don't need to understand anything."

But this isn't true. In order to really **be** something, you have to understand things, even if you feel them.

And if you want to understand things, it's necessary to feel also.

We are **holistic beings**—we are everything. We need a little bit of understanding of all topics and all things.

## Etymology of "When"

### Quo + Door

In English, the word "when" comes from:
- **Quo** (or **quo-do**) = the object
- **Door** = place

The question is: **the object where?** The place where the object is.

### In Latin: Quando

In Latin, it transforms:
- Quo → Quad
- Quad + do → Quando

**Quando** means: the object where, the object where.

### In Nordic: When

In Nordic languages, this **quad** transformed into **when**.

---

## Why "When" is Made of Space Words

### Ancient Ones Didn't Separate Time and Space

For the ancient ones, **time and space were the same thing**.

They had gods for:
- Earth
- Water
- Air

But not a "god for space" as a separate thing.

### Chronos: God of Time and Transformation

The Greek god **Chronos** is called the "god of time," but actually he was the one **transforming matter**.

He was related to the transformation of matter—the process of change.

The god of time **was also** the god of space.

### We Divided Time and Space Recently

**We** (in modern Western culture) divided the concept of time and space.

Then just a few decades ago, we started putting them back together with the **relativity of time** (Einstein).

The relativity of time started giving us philosophy, movies, and spirituality that speak about the **unity between time and space**.

But this is just from recent years.

### The Ancient Truth

For the ancient ones, time and space **was the same thing**.

That's why the question "When?" is made up with words that are related to **space**, not time.

---

## Understanding Time Through the Horizon

### The Curvature of Earth

Imagine a little person standing on the curved surface of Earth.

(For those who believe Earth is flat: I'm sorry for what follows.)

This person has a **line of horizon**—the farthest distance they can see.

### Horizon: The Path of the Cycle

Why is this called **horizon**?

In Greek: **hodos-kyklos**
- **Hodos** = path
- **Kyklos** = circle

**Horizon** describes how the stars in a circle move, disappear, and come back again like a cycle—on a path, a way.

The horizon is **the path of the cycle of the stars**.

---

## Day and Night: Light, Not Time

### The Sun's Movement (Earth's Movement)

When the Earth spins, the Sun appears to move across the sky.

- The Sun rises at the horizon in the morning
- It moves across the sky
- It sets at the horizon in the evening

What's really happening: **the Earth is moving** in a direction, making the Sun seem to move the opposite way.

### Ancient People Couldn't Measure Time

Ancient people couldn't measure "time" because that's an abstract concept.

They could only **describe what they saw**—the position of light.

### Day: Shining Light

The shining light was called **geo** (or **deo**), which gives us the word **day**.

Day means **light, bright, shining**.

### Night: No Light

When the Sun sets, there's no more shining.

They put a particle of negation (**ni**) in front of **deo**:

**Ni-deo** → **night**

Night means **no bright, no shine**.

---

## The Parts of the Day (Based on Light Position)

### Morning

The light starting to come is something **good** (**ma**) that is **new** (**ni** or **ian**).

**Ma-ni-a** → gives origin to **morning** (or **mañana** in Spanish).

Morning means: **the good new light**.

### Midday

The light is in the **middle** of the sky.

**Mid** + **day** = **midday**.

### Afternoon

In English: **after** + **noon**.

The concept is the light is going **slower** (**tardo** in Latin = slow, behind).

The perception was that the light is going slower, or that we're **behind** something.

**After-noon** or **tarde** (Spanish) = behind, slow.

### Evening

**Even** comes from **eben**, meaning **behind** something **new** (**ian**).

**Eben-ian** → **evening**

Behind the horizon comes something new (the night).

---

## Hours: Rays of Divine Light

### The Ancient God of Light

In ancient times, the god of light (the Sun) was blessing humans with rays of light.

They had many different blessings or ways to be blessed, called **divinities** (the divine).

### Hul: Light and Hours

Each ray of light during the day was a divinity called **hul**.

The word **light** was **hul**.

When talking about the different gods of reality, they called them **the hul**.

That's the origin of **hours**.

The hours are the different rays of divine light throughout the day.

---

## All Time Words Come from Space

### Before, After, Now

All these words—**before, after, now, then, when**—come directly from **physical concepts**, from **space**.

Every time we speak about temporal things, we constantly relate them to **physical things**.

### We Are Trapped in the Third Dimension

When we understand that we're using the words for time related **only** to space, we can see:

**We are trapped in the third dimension all the time.**

Even the fourth dimension (time) we explain through **space**.

We don't have the terms for the fourth dimension. That's why we're still bounded to this one.

---

## Time and Gravity: The Twins Paradox

### Two Twins

Imagine twin brothers. One stays on Earth, the other goes on a spaceship for years.

What happens?
- The one who stays on Earth gets older really fast
- The one who went to space comes back young, like when he left

### Why? Gravity

This happens because of **gravity**.

Time is related to the **gravity** of the planet.

We are bounded to time because of the **gravity** in which we live.

If we leave this gravity, the time starts to be different—the hours, the way we transform, starts to be different according to other gravities in other spots.

### Time is Matter Transforming

This is why we understand: **everything we call time is really matter transforming itself constantly.**

---

## The Eternal Present

### In the Macrocosmos: Only the Present

In the macrocosmos, **time doesn't really exist** because time is related to the movement of space.

There is nothing in the reality of the macrocosmos except the **present**, the constant **here and now**.

It's the only thing that really exists in space.

### People Don't Age Because of Time

People don't age or die because of "time."

We age and die because:
- Molecules decompose
- Oxygen dissolves cells
- Cells fall apart
- Matter itself decomposes

It's not because of time. It's because of **matter transforming**.

### Time is Not Apart from Space

Time is not really something apart from space.

It's almost the same thing, related to the **gravity of matter**.

---

## The Microcosmos: Different Times, Different Spaces

### Where Time Really Exists

The only way you can really "leave" the time of the macrocosmos is in the **microcosmos**.

In the microcosmos, one particle can be **in many different places at the same time**.

One particle can be on the back, behind, before, in front, after, beside—**here, now**—all at once.

### Different Times = Different Spaces

From the point of view of the microcosmos, **different times are different spaces**.

### Past Lives and Parallel Realities

A past life has happened, but it's still alive in the **memory of the cells**—that's why we can remember it.

From the point of view of the microcosmos, that past life is **actually happening** in one **parallel reality**.

### When is About Location

The question "when" is a matter of **location**:
- In the macrocosmos: related to **where** I locate the things
- In the microcosmos: related to **where** are manifested the possibilities of only one particle

---

## Why We Say "Here and Now"

### The Literal Truth

People say: "We have to be here and now."

This isn't just a nice spiritual saying.

**It's literally true.**

The only thing that exists **is** here and now.

### Matter is Constantly in the Present

Matter is constantly in the present all the time.

When I say "the present, here and now, constantly," I'm speaking about the **material reality**—from atoms up to all this reality we see.

That's the physical aspect of this reality.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness: When = Where

Today, when you ask "when?" questions, rephrase them as "where?" questions:
- "When will I be happy?" → "Where am I in the cycle of happiness?"
- "When will this end?" → "Where am I in this process?"

Notice how it changes your perspective.

### Recognizing the Eternal Present

When you feel stuck in the past or anxious about the future, remember:

The past is a **location** in your cells (memory).

The future is a **location** in potential space (possibility).

The only actual **location** you're in is **here, now**.

### Time as Transformation

When you say "I don't have time," recognize:

You're really saying "I don't have space/energy for this transformation right now."

Time isn't running out. Matter is transforming. Are you transforming with it?

## Week Context

Mental Week of Aries—Questions that Ignite Consciousness:

- Day 1 (Crown): What? (object)
- Day 2 (Third Eye): Why? (cause/origin)
- Day 3 (Throat): What for? (effect/purpose)
- Day 4 (Heart): Which? (quality/choice)
- Day 5 (Solar Plexus): Who? (subject/identity)
- Day 6 (Sacral): How? (method/path)
- Day 7 (Root): How much? (quantity/measurement)
- Day 8 (Knees): When? (time/location in cycle)
- Continuing through Day 10...

We're building a complete map of how questions create consciousness and how language shapes reality.

## Q&A

### Q: If time doesn't exist, how can I remember the past?

The "past" exists as **memory in your cells**—a location in your body's matter. You're not remembering something that happened "back in time." You're accessing a location in your cellular structure where that experience is stored.

### Q: Does this mean time travel is impossible?

In the macrocosmos (matter), yes. But in the microcosmos (consciousness), you already "time travel"—you access different locations (past memories, future possibilities) constantly. It's not moving through time; it's accessing different **locations** in consciousness.

### Q: Why do clocks work if time doesn't exist?

Clocks measure the **transformation of matter**—the rotation of Earth, the swing of a pendulum, the vibration of a quartz crystal. They measure **cycles of change**, not "time" as an independent thing.

### Q: If everything is happening now, is my future already determined?

No. In the microcosmos, all possibilities exist simultaneously. Your consciousness **choosing to observe** one possibility is what manifests it. The future is all possible locations; which one manifests depends on your present awareness.

### Q: How does this relate to manifestation?

When you "manifest the future," you're not pulling something from later in time. You're choosing which **location in possibility space** to observe and give energy to. Your attention collapses the wave of possibility into the particle of experience.

### Q: Why does the twin in space age slower?

Because time is **relative to gravity**. Less gravity = slower transformation of matter = slower "aging." Time isn't an external force—it's the rate of matter's transformation based on gravitational field.

### Q: What's the practical value of knowing "when" is really "where"?

It shifts you from feeling controlled by time (linear, limited, running out) to recognizing your location in a cycle (circular, eternal, always returning). You stop waiting for "when" and start recognizing "where am I now?"
