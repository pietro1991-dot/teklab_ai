## Overview

Welcome to the second day of alignment. Today, we continue our journey by focusing on the third eye chakra, the portal of consciousness. The vibration for today is "Mae," activating the awareness and perception within. This day is about observing all possibilities and understanding the projections and perceptions we have of the world. We are descending the energy from higher levels of consciousness to the earth, aligning our inner being rather than simply opening the third eye to see things. The key is to center ourselves and align with our true awareness.

## Core Teaching

### The Third Eye: Portal of Consciousness

The third eye chakra is the center of observation and perception. It allows us to project our intentions into the world and receive perceptions from our surroundings. The sound "M" means portal, and "A" means consciousness; together, "Mae" activates the portal of consciousness. The third eye is not just about seeing visions or mystical experiences—its true purpose is to align our inner being and expand our awareness. When we open our perspectives without fear, we see the world as a reflection of our inner state. Demons and negative projections are simply manifestations of imbalance in the universal mind. By centering ourselves, these projections dissolve.

### Centering and Alignment

It is important to relax and find a comfortable position, ideally the tetrahedron posture, but any position that feels right is acceptable. The body should be straight, not lying down, to channel energy from above. Begin by moving and massaging the body, becoming aware of every joint, muscle, and organ. Focus on your breathing, inhaling and exhaling through the nose, and allow the oxygen to energize your entire being. Bring attention to the part of your body that feels most present, whether due to pain or pleasure, and recognize the sensations without judgment.

### Awareness of Emotion and Thought

Next, bring awareness to the first emotion you feel, observing it without judgment. Then, notice the first thought that crosses your mind, holding it gently and giving it shape. Imagine these three aspects—body, emotion, and thought—as spheres. With your eyes closed, raise these spheres to the height of your third eye, recognizing that they represent your consciousness for today. Contemplate their meaning and allow them to nourish the seed of your third eye.

## Practice

2. Relax your body, moving and massaging joints and muscles.

8. Feel the light pouring into the third eye, opening it with a deep blue indigo color.
9. Vibrate the sound "Mae," activating the portal of consciousness. Repeat and feel the vibration in your third eye.
10. Visualize the flower of the third eye opening, projecting your awareness outward.
11. Affirm: "I Am the Portal of Consciousness." Repeat several times.
12. Recognize that everything you observe externally is a projection of your inner self.
13. Massage your forehead, eyes, ears, nose, and cheeks, then gently massage your body down to your feet, discharging static energy.
