# Day 184 - Consciousness Work

## Introduction

Hello , everybody. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

I hope you are okay. Everyone 's fine. How are you handling the energy of the queries? With the miracle , redrawn.

The level of information today , I do n't know how I had lived it because I just finished to read the post for today and I have no idea when I have to explain about what is the topic that I have to talk about really literally. I have no idea.

So maybe I am a bit tired because I had a workshop conference today in the campus Arslan in Spanish.

So I do n't know if it 's that if I 'm tired or I do n't know.

Today there were so many topics that literally I have no idea what is the main one. I guess that I 'm going to need the board but really I have no idea what I have to explain. Clearly , I queries is just having fun with me. The topic for today is Lira , the constellation of Lira.

But anyway , I will recommend you to read the post many times. The constellation of Lira has within one of the biggest and closest stars to our system , which is Dia. Dia is a really huge star , a 25 light years from Earth. This star is very important for us because it is also one of the northern stars of the like Paris , like the one that guides us.

And it started to be the star that guides us 12,000 years ago in the moment of in the moment of the fall of Atlantis. I have no idea if the star of Dia is related to Digging. I do n't know. But what we are talking today is related to what happened 12,000 years ago when this star was the northern star.

I am really in blank this moment.

So I will leave that the energy of the moment or their my thoughts. The moment sorry. Just the tiny moment. Just to get the idea of what happened when Dia started to rule the north , the purpose of this world , we have to understand what happened a little bit before which is the era of Virgo.

Because when Dia started to point the north , the purpose of the planet , started to start to eat the era of Leo.

So we need to understand the era of Virgo in order to understand what is going to happen in the era of Leo. And that is 12,000 years ago. First of all Atlantis. Atlantis is a civilization that was spread in the time of Virgo.

During the process of Virgo time , Atlantis civilization was like kind of the mother that spread around the whole planet. United beings that came from the stars connected to the beings that were on the on the era.

So those are the beings where beings that they were not used to have this pigmentation of the skin.

So they were really really white , really transparent. And that 's why you could see the things all over. And that 's why they were called the blue ones. This match of the people from the heavens and the people from the earth were called the blue ones.

And this , this blue ones is because the people from the outside they had not this so much oxygen.

So they did n't oxidase their blood.

So you can tell by this alpina people that they were very blue.

So that 's why they were called the blue ones.

## Energy Work

So these blue ones , the blue ones were divided into 12 families. And the 12 families were divided like this because they had to go to the main portals of the planet which were 12.

So they could bring harmony in the process of the planet.

So they could open the doors of this spaceship machine which is earth through the different dimensions.

So in order to open those doors of the planet , they needed to be the perfect keys for that. And in order to do that , you needed to be coherent , which is to be according to the different levels of your own self , which is mentally , emotionally , and physically , we had to be aligned as one.

So the 12 families were the ones trying to find these coherence.

So they could be in this cords of vibration to make the planet rebound perfectly.

So these blue ones were the ones trying to understand how to handle whole universe and they understood that if everything is vibration , the best way to handle the reality is through music. The relation of this process of the blue ones trying to find the music as a tool for balance is related to the constellation of Lira. Even if we are speaking here about a weak mythology , this is related to the process of what happened with the Atlanta ones. The constellation of Lira is called like this because of Orbits.

Orbits was this son of a child between a mouse and the son. And he was the one that did the most beautiful music in whole world.

So he played so beautifully that the story says that he was able to come all the beasts and all the demons and anything that were terrible , they would sleep and to come because of his music. And this story is kind of related to what happened with the blue ones because they were trying to open the interdimensional doors of the world. And in order to do that they used vibration to calm all these dark energies and all these low vibrations and distortions from the universe.

So as we spoke that the viruses of different the viruses of different realities and dimensions , they are not evil by itself. They are related to distortions.

So the things are distorted. The distortion of something represents that something is disharmonized.

So our goal is to harmonize these distortions. What the abundance used to try to do was to find harmony in the music , was to find harmony in the structure.

So all the disharmonize and distorted realities could be balanced.

So they could use it properly and they could be free in this network. That 's why the story of our fuse is very related to the story of the blue ones.

Okay , so the speaking about the the lira this instrument for that time or now we can understand that the earth has this instrumental music. This instrument , sorry , in its electromagnetic field.

So all the the fields of the earth , they seem to be like the strings of a harp.

So what they used to do in that time , the blue ones was to try to touch the magnetic field of the planet in order to find the balance , the harmony.

So remember the video yesterday that I show you how from one person is created the whole structure of the planet with the daughter of a tyrant.

So remember that the so families went to leave in those doors of the daughter of a tyrant in the planet.

So they could handle these balance with the vibration and the music.

So the magnetic field would be working and the whole structure of the spaceship earth could work.

So what they started to do was to find the way in which they could download that information from every dimension in the magnetic field through creating structures in this world that we call pyramids. The pyramids are the structures that download the electrons of the field and like a ray , like a lightning of lightning in a storm. They download all this mass of energy from the environment so they would be able to use it to create much more energy from the magnetic field from every downloading information from every dimension. That 's the network of networks.

What they did with this machines that we call pyramids is to create a way to download the electrons of the magnetic field to open the portals of information of information.

So they could download this electrons from the magnetic field and they could handle it for their own benefits.

So basically the pyramids were spreading all this huge amount of energy from the magnetic field download from other dimensions shared to everyone.

So that would be kind of what Nikola Tesla wanted to do with the free energy. This network that that that lanterns used is kind of like what we used today with the Wi-Fi internet signals , radio communications , all the things that we are using wireless is related to the same thing that the Tesla did were used in a lanterns and times , but of course they did n't use it to see Netflix. The use it for another thing was to upload and download information from other realities and the communication between different regions. But the only way you can download that information is by coherent.

So connecting the three aspects , the physical one , the transformative one , and the divine one which are related to the codes in geometry with three , six , nine. It 's basically the architecture of the being that was created. The idea was not to download information from other worlds. The idea was to open the information from every dimension , which is from myself through the information of myself in different dimensions.

So that 's what we were trying to do.

So it was realizing that all information that the universe lives in different dimensions within ourselves. The only thing that is important to well , the thing that is important to to see about this is that the people , the atlas and people , they were not like magical people. They were not flying in spaceship or whatever. They were doing basically the same thing that Tesla was trying to do 100 years ago , which is using the alternate current and projections , the towers of waves , vibrations , wifi.

So when you open the doors between different dimensions , you open parts of yourself that are really dark and other ones that are really light and this means that in order to get to all information , you have to be open to transform yourself to be different. And that 's something that a civilization born in the age of Virgo would never do. They would control it. They would n't transform.

It 's basically because of this that the international doors starts to collapse because we did n't let it go. Basically what happened to that luncheon is the same thing that happened to our fuse. When they were willing to love , when they got in love , they lost it. They lost the connection , they lost that and they were willing to go into the depth to the hell , to save her.

And what they did was try to what our fuse that Lane 's were trying to do was to take their love outside to the clarity , but they were jealous. They had no idea. They had doubts. They were so attached to the image of what it was that they wanted for it to be again the same.

So he lost everything. He lost the life and in depth. That 's what happened to him. Basically it was because of jealousy and because of attachment to what they expected for it to be that made them lost the connection.

What happened to me? Aged student. Who! !

There 's a music video right after that because called Data people , God laid upon God eyed on love There walk on God And trusting Our days and zero And not ever Is a monk having Kong 's body , His flesh? I overcome in fear. Yes. God , I e'vadhnaan Banana , Pop and advise And My denim.

That 's right. That 's right. Oh , we 're almost there. Oh , we 're almost there.

And that 's right. That 's right. That 's right. That 's right.

Oh , we 're almost there. That 's right. That 's right. I ca n't do that.

That 's right. I 'm going to die. I 'm going to die. No matter what happens , I 'm going to die.

That 's right. That 's right. That 's right. Oh , we 're almost there.
