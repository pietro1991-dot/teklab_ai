## Overview

Day 203. Big announcement day—Matias shared news about a major gathering event planned for **February 22, 2022** (2/22/22).

The energy is buzzing with **communication, announcements, connections**—which is perfect, because today's planet is **Mercury.**

We connect with the **throat chakra**—the center of **communication, expression, truth-speaking.**

And we explore **Mercury**—the fastest-moving planet, the **messenger of the gods**, the archetype of **communication, travel, commerce, and the sharing of knowledge.**

But as with Neptune, Matias emphasizes:

**Mercury (Hermes in Greek, Thoth/Djehuti in Egyptian) is NOT a person. Mercury is a CONCEPT.**

It's like **"the Pope"**—a title, a role, an archetype that many different people can embody throughout history.

Many people **were** Mercury. Many people **were** Thoth. They incarnated the **concept** of the messenger, the one who brings knowledge, the one who connects cultures.

And today, we're exploring what that archetype teaches us about **communication, coherence, and the power of sharing truth.**

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology of Mercury: The Merchant

In **Latin and Etruscan** languages, the name **Mercury** comes from:

- **"Merx"** = commerce, trade, goods
- **"-arius"** (or "-urius") = the one who does

Put together: **"Mercurius" = "the merchant"—the one who trades, who buys and sells, who exchanges goods.**

In **Greek**, the same god is called **Hermes** (Ἑρμῆς), which comes from:

- **"Herma"** = a **cairn** (a pile of stones used as a marker on paths)
- **"-es"** = the one

So **"Hermes" = "the one who is in the cairn"—the one who marks the path, who guides travelers, who ensures people don't get lost.**

### The Cairn: Guiding the Way

A **cairn** is a stack of stones placed along a path—especially in mountains, deserts, or remote areas—to mark the route so travelers don't lose their way.

**Who built these cairns? Merchants and travelers.**

Why? Because **merchants traveled constantly**—from town to town, city to city, across dangerous terrain.

They needed to know the paths. They needed to mark the way. They needed to make sure **others could follow.**

So **Hermes (Mercury)** became the god who **protects travelers, guides the way, marks the path.**

But merchants did MORE than just trade goods.

### Merchants Were the Messengers

In ancient times, **merchants were the social media, the news networks, the information highways.**

People didn't just go to the market to **buy and sell**—they went to **hear the NEWS.**

Merchants would bring:
- **Stories** from other cities
- **Rumors** about kings and wars
- **New ideas** and philosophies
- **Technology** and innovations
- **Messages** from one town to another

If a king wanted to know what the people were thinking, he would **ask the merchants**—because they listened to the conversations in the marketplace and reported back.

**Merchants were spies, journalists, diplomats, and storytellers all in one.**

That's why **Mercury/Hermes** became the god of **communication, messages, and travel**—because merchants **carried the word** from place to place.

### Mercury in Greek and Roman Mythology

In **Greek mythology**, **Hermes** is:
- The **messenger of the gods** (especially Zeus)
- The **guide of souls** to the underworld (psychopomp)
- The **god of travelers, thieves, merchants, and communication**
- Depicted with **winged sandals** (speed) and a **caduceus** (staff with two snakes)

In **Roman mythology**, **Mercury** is the exact same figure—just with a Latin name.

Mercury is **fast, clever, adaptable**—he moves between worlds, carries messages, facilitates exchanges.

He's the **connector**, the **intermediary**, the one who **bridges gaps.**

### Thoth/Djehuti: The Egyptian Mercury

In **Egyptian tradition**, the same archetype is called **Thoth** (in Greek) or **Djehuti** (the original Egyptian pronunciation).

The Greeks couldn't pronounce "Djehuti," so they said **"Thoth"** (like "thought").

**Thoth/Djehuti** is:
- The god of **writing, knowledge, wisdom, and magic**
- The **scribe of the gods** (he records everything)
- The **inventor of language, mathematics, and astronomy**
- The **measurer of time** (he keeps the cosmic records)

Thoth is depicted with the **head of an ibis** (a bird associated with wisdom and precision).

He is the one who **brings divine knowledge to humanity**—just like Mercury brings messages from the gods.

### Mercury is a CONCEPT, Not a Person

Here's where Matias makes a critical clarification:

**Mercury, Hermes, Thoth—these are NOT individual people.**

**They are TITLES. They are ROLES. They are ARCHETYPES.**

It's like **"the Pope."**

When you say "the Pope," you might think of **Pope Francis** (the current one).

But you could also say "the Pope" referring to **Pope Benedict**, or **Pope John Paul II**, or any of the popes throughout history.

**"The Pope" is a CONCEPT—a role that many people have filled.**

The same is true for **Mercury/Hermes/Thoth.**

Throughout history, **many people** embodied the archetype of the messenger—the one who brings knowledge, the one who connects cultures, the one who channels divine wisdom.

They were called **"Hermes"** or **"Thoth"** not because that was their birth name, but because they **incarnated the CONCEPT.**

Matias says:

**"Someone mentioned Hermes Trismegistus ('Hermes the Thrice-Great'). Yes, he existed. But 'Hermes' wasn't his name—it was his TITLE. He was embodying the concept of Hermes in that moment."**

**"The same with Merlin. 'Merlin' means 'blackbird' in French. It's not a personal name—it's a title for the magician who embodied that concept."**

**"Many people throughout history were named with the same name because they reincarnated the same CONCEPT."**

### Channeling Mercury: Accessing the Concept

This is why **so many people today can 'channel' Thoth or Hermes.**

They're not channeling **a specific dead person.**

They're channeling **the ARCHETYPE**—the information, the frequency, the concept of the messenger and the keeper of knowledge.

Matias says:

**"We are not channeling THE person. We are channeling the CONCEPT of this person. The information that they held."**

This is powerful because it means:

**You don't need to be "special" to access Mercury's wisdom.**

**You just need to TUNE IN to the archetype—the frequency of communication, coherence, truth-sharing, and connection.**

### Wednesday: Mercury's Day

In many languages, **Wednesday** is named after Mercury:

- **Spanish**: *Miércoles* (day of Mercury)
- **French**: *Mercredi* (Mercury's day)
- **Italian**: *Mercoledì* (Mercury's day)

In **English**, Wednesday comes from **"Woden's Day"** (Woden = Odin in Norse mythology).

**Odin** and **Mercury** are the same archetype—both are **messengers, bringers of knowledge, guides of souls, keepers of runes/writing.**

So even in English, **Wednesday is Mercury's day**—it's just using the Norse name instead of the Roman one.

### Mercury Retrograde: The Review Period

Matias mentions that this year (from February to February), there will be **three periods of Mercury Retrograde**—each lasting about three weeks.

**What is Mercury Retrograde?**

It's when Mercury **appears** to move backward in the sky (from our perspective on Earth). It's an optical illusion caused by the relative speeds of Earth and Mercury's orbits.

Astrologically, **Mercury Retrograde** is a time of:
- **Review** (not moving forward, but looking back)
- **Reflection** (reconsidering decisions, redoing tasks)
- **Communication breakdowns** (misunderstandings, technology glitches, travel delays)

Matias says the three retrogrades will focus on:
1. **Physical review** (body, health, material world)
2. **Emotional review** (feelings, relationships, patterns)
3. **Spiritual review** (beliefs, practices, alignment)

The suggestion: **Use these periods to REVIEW, not to launch new things.**

## Practice

### Speaking with Coherence: Mercury's Gift

Today's practice is about **honoring your throat chakra** and learning to **communicate with truth, clarity, and coherence.**

**Step 1: Sit and Ground**  
Sit comfortably. Place one hand on your **throat**—the center of communication.

Feel your breath moving in and out through your throat. Notice the **vibration** of your breath.

**Step 2: Acknowledge Mercury's Archetype**  
Say (aloud or silently): **"Mercury, guide me to speak with truth. Help me communicate with clarity and coherence."**

You're not praying to a being—you're **invoking the archetype**, the **principle** of clear communication.

**Step 3: Check for Coherence**  
Ask yourself: **"Do my words match my truth? Am I saying what I actually mean? Am I communicating clearly, or am I hiding/distorting?"**

**Coherence = alignment** between what you think, what you feel, and what you say.

**Incoherence = saying one thing while thinking/feeling another.**

**Step 4: Speak One Truth**  
Think of **one thing** you've been avoiding saying—to yourself or to someone else.

It doesn't have to be dramatic. It could be:
- "I need rest."
- "I don't actually agree with that."
- "I'm struggling."
- "I love you."

**Say it aloud.** Even if you're alone. **Practice speaking your truth.**

**Step 5: Sound the Vibration**  
With your hand still on your throat, sound the vibration **"He"** three times.

Feel it resonate through your **throat chakra**, clearing any blockages, opening the channel of communication.

**Step 6: Speak the Statement**  
Say aloud: **"I Am the Life in Coherence."**

Your life is **lived through coherence**—when what you think, feel, and say are ALIGNED.

Mercury teaches: **Truth-speaking is life-giving.**

**Step 7: Commit to One Communication**  
Identify **one conversation** you need to have today or this week.

Commit to having it **with coherence**—saying what you actually mean, clearly and honestly.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**The Coherence Check:**  
Throughout the day, before you speak, **pause** and ask: **"Is this coherent? Does this match my truth?"**

If yes, **speak it clearly.**  
If no, **either adjust what you say, or stay silent.**

**Don't speak incoherently just to fill space.**

**Become the Messenger:**  
Today, **share something valuable** with someone:
- A piece of knowledge
- A helpful resource
- An insight
- A truth they need to hear

**Be Mercury—the one who carries useful information from place to place.**

**Throat Chakra Awareness:**  
Several times today, touch your **throat** and say: **"I Am the Life in Coherence."**

Feel the **vibration** of your voice. Notice when your throat feels **open** (truth-speaking) vs. **tight** (withholding/lying).

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching today is: **Communication is sacred. Words carry power. Speak with coherence.**

In our modern world, we've **devalued communication**:

- We say things we don't mean
- We hide our truth to avoid conflict
- We fill space with empty words
- We lie casually
- We communicate without thinking

But **Mercury teaches**:

**Words are MAGIC. Language is CREATION. Communication is how we BUILD REALITY.**

When you speak **coherently** (aligned with truth), you create **clarity, trust, connection.**

When you speak **incoherently** (misaligned with truth), you create **confusion, distrust, disconnection.**

**Every word you speak is either building or destroying.**

Mercury, the messenger, asks:

**"What message are you carrying? What are you communicating to the world?"**

Is it **truth**? Is it **coherence**? Is it **valuable**?

Or is it just **noise**?

**Be the cairn—mark the path clearly so others can follow.**

**Be the merchant—bring valuable knowledge from place to place.**

**Be the messenger—speak the truth that needs to be spoken.**

## Aquarius Physical Week Context

We are in the **Physical Week of Aquarius**, connecting with the **throat chakra**—the center of communication and expression.

Aquarius is the **networker**, the **communicator**, the one who **shares information across the web.**

And Mercury teaches: **The network is only as strong as the CLARITY of communication.**

If you communicate **incoherently**, the network breaks down.

If you communicate **with truth**, the network THRIVES.

**Aquarius is the network. Mercury is the messenger moving through the network.**

Together, they say: **Speak truth. Share knowledge. Connect with coherence.**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does the name "Mercury" mean?

**"Mercury" comes from Latin "Mercurius"**: merx (commerce, trade, goods) + arius (the one who does). It means **"the merchant"—the one who trades and exchanges.** In Greek, the same god is **Hermes**, which comes from "herma" (a cairn—pile of stones marking a path). **Hermes = "the one who guides the way."**

### Q: Why were merchants associated with being messengers?

Because **merchants traveled constantly** from town to town, and they didn't just trade goods—they **brought the NEWS.** People went to the market not only to buy things but to **hear what was happening** in other places. Merchants carried **stories, rumors, innovations, messages** from one place to another. They were the **social media, the news networks, the information highways of ancient times.**

### Q: Who is Thoth, and how is he related to Mercury?

**Thoth (Djehuti in Egyptian pronunciation)** is the Egyptian version of the messenger/wisdom-keeper archetype. He's the **god of writing, knowledge, wisdom, magic, mathematics, and astronomy**—the scribe of the gods who records everything. The Greeks called him **Thoth** because they couldn't pronounce "Djehuti." **Thoth = Mercury = Hermes—all the same archetype.**

### Q: Are Mercury, Hermes, and Thoth actual people or concepts?

**CONCEPTS.** They are **titles, roles, archetypes**—like "the Pope." Many people throughout history embodied the concept of the messenger and were called "Hermes" or "Thoth" not because that was their birth name, but because they **incarnated the archetype.** For example, **Hermes Trismegistus existed**, but "Hermes" was his TITLE (he embodied the messenger/wisdom concept), not his personal name.

### Q: Can we "channel" Mercury or Thoth?

**Yes, but you're not channeling a specific dead person—you're channeling the ARCHETYPE.** You're tuning in to **the frequency, the information, the concept** of the messenger and wisdom-keeper. This is why many people can access "Thoth's wisdom"—they're accessing the **archetypal field**, not a single entity.

### Q: Why is Wednesday named after Mercury?

In Romance languages, Wednesday is **Miércoles (Spanish), Mercredi (French), Mercoledì (Italian)**—all meaning **"Mercury's day."** In English, it's **"Wednesday" = "Woden's Day"** (Woden = Odin in Norse). **Odin and Mercury are the same archetype**—both messengers, bringers of knowledge, guides of souls, keepers of writing/runes.

### Q: What does "I Am the Life in Coherence" mean?

**Coherence = alignment** between what you think, what you feel, and what you say. When you live in coherence, your **words match your truth**—you say what you mean, you mean what you say. **Incoherence** = saying one thing while thinking/feeling another (lying, hiding, distorting). Mercury teaches: **Truth-speaking is life-giving. Coherence creates clarity and connection.**
