# Day 333 - Consciousness Work

## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon , good evening.

So the topic for today is stream , which is those streams of water that then are born in the mountains , in the top of the mountains and the caves. Going down to the valleys to create the rivers. Basically , the water that emerges from the fall of the rain. Beyond the meaning of stream , which is a flow of water , in Spanish , the word stream , which is arrow , has a very deeper concept , which is the action of cleaning the soil , the mud , and all the stones in a stream of water.

The stream of water to clean and find the gold. And the concept of this is , basically , we are the cleaning of this mud of this soil , is a rest magnification of the things that are dirty for us. And that we need to tap until we see the gold. To recignify , basically means to put a new direction or a new purpose.

On something that we already thought it had one. And all this year is like a huge precignification. I was saying today that it seems like if each one of us , it 's his own stream trying to clean the mud to find the shining gold. And actually , we will be our whole life doing this process , then we call it a recignify.

And the way we can recignify something is basically by taking that idea and trying to think about. Trying to think about the context in which we started to have that idea or that thing. And then trying to think about it in the new context which is today. Trying to think of that idea that we have from something.

Is useful in the new context today. Every time that our context changed , where we see our perspective of it will also change. This is why we have always to recignify things. Even if we are attached to this.

And I am recignifying.

Today is our day. 333. 333. Is the 9.

The cold. Of course. I thought that the day 333 would be a celebration. But this is the second time in this week that 333 tells me that it 's not that I am not ready.

I 'm sorry it 's been 333 days and I have the same problem. It 's like I feel like that 's not a good example because I just like if anything that I could say really worth. Because I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.

I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it. I am not doing it.
