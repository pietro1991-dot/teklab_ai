## Overview

Welcome to Day 25, where we explore the solar plexus chakra through the pancreas gland—the organ that governs energy, both physical and emotional, and reveals a profound truth about the nature of existence: we exist because of our relationships with each other.

The pancreas is perhaps most famous for producing insulin and regulating blood sugar, controlling how our bodies convert food into usable energy. But from an energetic and spiritual perspective, the pancreas does much more than process physical nutrients. It processes the emotional energy we receive from our environment and from our relationships with others.

This teaching challenges a common misconception in spiritual circles: the idea that the solar plexus work is primarily about filling yourself with your own love, becoming independent of others, not needing anyone. While it's true that we must develop a strong sense of self (I Am), today's teaching reveals that the I Am is not solitary—it exists in relationship.

You are who you are because of everyone you've ever met, every relationship you've ever had, every exchange of energy that has occurred between you and the world. The pancreas processes all of this relational energy, creating the fuel that powers your sense of self, your I Am. The profound realization is that we don't exist in isolation—we exist because of the constant flow of giving and receiving with others.

## Core Teaching

### The Pancreas: Location and Function

The pancreas is a long, flat gland located deep in the abdomen, behind the stomach and in front of the spine. It sits roughly at the level of the solar plexus chakra, that energetic center located just above the navel and below the sternum.

The pancreas has two main functions:

**Exocrine Function:** The pancreas produces digestive enzymes that are released into the small intestine. These enzymes break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates from our food, making nutrients available for absorption. About 95% of the pancreas is dedicated to this digestive function.

**Endocrine Function:** The pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets of Langerhans that produce hormones, most importantly insulin and glucagon. These hormones regulate blood glucose (blood sugar) levels, controlling how our cells access and use energy. Insulin allows cells to take in glucose from the bloodstream to use as fuel. Glucagon raises blood sugar when it gets too low by triggering the release of stored glucose from the liver.

This dual function—digesting what we take in and regulating energy distribution—perfectly mirrors the energetic function of the solar plexus chakra. The plexus receives energy from the environment, processes it, and distributes it throughout the system to create a strong, integrated sense of self.

When this system is balanced, we have steady energy, emotional stability, healthy self-esteem, and good boundaries around what we take in and what we give out. When it's imbalanced, we may experience blood sugar issues, digestive problems, emotional volatility, poor boundaries, or a weak sense of self.

### Glucose: The Fuel of the I Am

Glucose is the body's primary fuel source. It powers every cell, especially the brain and nervous system. The pancreas produces insulin, which allows cells to take in glucose and use it for energy. Without insulin, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream but can't enter cells—so you have energy available but can't access it. With too much insulin, blood sugar drops too low and you don't have enough fuel available.

This physical dynamic is a perfect metaphor for the energetic work of the solar plexus. The plexus processes energy—both physical (food, nutrients) and subtle (emotions, relational exchanges, experiences)—and converts it into usable fuel for your life, for your actions, for your sense of self.

When your plexus is balanced, you can:
- Take in nourishment (physical and emotional)
- Process it effectively
- Convert it to energy for your life
- Maintain steady, available power
- Have strength in your I Am, your sense of self

When your plexus is imbalanced, you may:
- Take in too much and be overwhelmed
- Take in too little and feel depleted
- Process ineffectively, unable to convert experiences into usable wisdom or energy
- Have spikes and crashes in your emotional/energetic state
- Feel weak in your sense of self, your I Am

The teaching states that the pancreas "gives strength to the body, to the self, to the I Am." It creates the energetic foundation for your identity, your personal power, your ability to show up in the world.

### The Digestive Process: Transforming Intake into Self

The entire digestive system—stomach, liver, pancreas, intestines—works together to take what comes from outside (food) and transform it into you. What was once a plant or an animal or a grain becomes your flesh, your blood, your energy, your thoughts.

This physical process mirrors the psychological and energetic process of identity formation. Everything you experience, every relationship, every emotion, every piece of information—you take it in, process it through your solar plexus, and it becomes part of who you are.

The teaching emphasizes that the pancreas receives "everything we inherit and everything we eat." This includes:
- Physical food and nutrients
- Emotional energy from relationships
- Ancestral patterns and family dynamics
- Environmental influences
- Information and experiences

All of this is processed by the digestive system and particularly by the pancreas, which then spreads energy to the entire body so that every organ has what it needs. The pancreas is the harmonizer, the one that tries to make sure everything is balanced, everything has enough, the whole system has integrity.

The solar plexus is where you integrate all these inputs into a coherent sense of self. "I Am by definition the result of what I feel from the environment." You are the product of everything you've taken in and how you've processed it. Your I Am is not separate from your relationships and experiences—it's created through them.

### Emotions in the Plexus: The Butterflies and the Emptiness

One of the most immediate and recognizable experiences of plexus energy is the "butterflies in your stomach" or the feeling of emptiness or hollowness in your belly. These sensations are intimately connected to our emotional responses to other people.

When you're excited about seeing someone you care about, when you're nervous about a social situation, when you're in love, when you're anxious about how someone perceives you—you feel it in your plexus. That fluttering, that nervous energy, that hollow feeling—all centered in the solar plexus area where the pancreas sits.

Why? Because the plexus is where we process our relational and emotional energy. It's where we feel our connection (or disconnection) with others. The teaching states: "Everything we feel for others and what they feel for us is received and controlled by the pancreas."

This is not just metaphorical. The plexus is intimately connected to the autonomic nervous system, which governs our fight-or-flight response and our social engagement. When we feel emotionally threatened, excited, connected, or rejected, our nervous system responds—and we feel it in the solar plexus.

The physical sensation in your gut when you think about someone you love or someone who hurt you—that's real energetic and neurological processing happening in your plexus. The pancreas and digestive system respond to emotional states, which is why stress, anxiety, and relationship issues often manifest as digestive problems or blood sugar dysregulation.

### The Revolutionary Truth: We Exist Through Relationship

Here is where today's teaching becomes truly profound and challenges much conventional spiritual wisdom:

**"I Am by definition the result of what I feel from the environment. We exist because of the relationships between each other."**

Many spiritual teachings emphasize independence, self-sufficiency, filling yourself up with your own love so you don't need anyone else. While developing a strong, integrated sense of self is crucial, today's teaching reveals that the goal is not isolation or complete independence.

The truth is: **we exist through relationship.** You are who you are because of everyone you've ever met. Your identity was formed through relationship with your parents, your family, your culture, your friends, your lovers, your enemies. Every interaction shaped you. Every exchange of energy contributed to your I Am.

The teaching uses the example of nature: "Everything in nature has something to give and something they need." Every being gives and receives constantly. The flower gives nectar and receives pollination. The tree gives oxygen and receives carbon dioxide. The river gives water and receives rainfall. The mother gives milk and receives purpose. Everything is in constant exchange.

**"The universe doesn't see two different things exchanging. The universe sees one being flowing constantly, sharing information in the same body."**

This is unity consciousness: recognizing that all the apparent separations—me and you, giving and receiving, self and other—are actually one flow, one body, one being. We are not separate individuals who occasionally interact. We are nodes in a vast network of relationship, constantly exchanging energy, creating each other through our connections.

### The Pancreas and the Flow of Love

The teaching addresses a critical misconception: the idea that having pancreatic problems means you need to fill yourself with your own love and stop depending on others.

The truth is different: **"The most common conflict that creates a pancreatic problem is the lack of love."** But not lack of self-love in isolation—lack of love in relationship, lack of emotional energy flowing between self and others.

The pancreas becomes ill when there's a disruption in the flow of giving and receiving love. This can manifest as:
- Not receiving the love and support you need
- Not giving the love you have to offer
- Emotional isolation
- Relationship conflicts that block energy flow
- Feeling unworthy of receiving
- Being unable or unwilling to give
- Imbalanced exchange (all giving or all taking)

Healing doesn't come from becoming completely independent and self-sufficient. It comes from restoring healthy flow in relationships—learning to receive love and support, learning to give love and energy, creating balanced exchanges where both giving and receiving happen freely.

The goal is not to need nothing from anyone. The goal is to participate fully in the dance of interdependence, to give and receive with ease, to recognize that you exist through relationship and that this is not a weakness but the fundamental nature of existence.

### Integrity and the Unified I Am

Despite the emphasis on relationship and interdependence, the solar plexus is also about the I Am—the integrated, coherent sense of self. How do we reconcile these seemingly opposite truths?

The pancreas "helps the I Am be united, integrated with integrity." Even though you are created through relationship, even though you exist because of constant exchange with others, you are still a coherent individual. You have boundaries. You have an identity. You have integrity (literally: wholeness, being integrated).

The healthy solar plexus creates a strong I Am that can participate in relationship without losing itself. It can give without depleting. It can receive without being overwhelmed or losing its identity. It knows what is self and what is other, even while recognizing the deep interconnection between them.

This is the balance: strong enough to be yourself, open enough to be in relationship. Integrated enough to have integrity, permeable enough to exchange energy. Individual enough to have a voice and will, connected enough to know you don't exist in isolation.

The pancreas physically maintains this balance by regulating energy distribution—making sure every organ gets what it needs while maintaining the overall harmony and integrity of the system. Energetically, the plexus maintains the balance between self and other, between giving and receiving, between independence and interdependence.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably with your spine straight. Bring your awareness to your solar plexus, the area just above your navel and below your sternum, in the center of your upper abdomen.

Place both hands on your solar plexus area, one hand over the other, feeling the warmth of your hands penetrating into your belly, reaching the pancreas deep inside.

Take several deep belly breaths, feeling your abdomen expand with each inhale. Notice the sensations in your plexus area. Is there tightness? Openness? Butterflies? Emptiness? Simply observe without judgment.

Set the intention to balance your pancreas, to harmonize your energy, to heal your relationship with giving and receiving, and to strengthen your I Am while opening to connection with others.

### Main Practice: Balancing the Pancreas and Solar Plexus

**Step 1:** Begin by acknowledging your pancreas and digestive system. Thank these organs for processing everything you take in—food, emotions, experiences—and converting it into energy for your life.

**Step 2:** Visualize a bright golden-yellow light at your solar plexus, centered on your pancreas. This is the color traditionally associated with this chakra—the color of sunshine, warmth, personal power, and energy.

**Step 3:** As you breathe in, imagine you're drawing healing golden light into your plexus. As you breathe out, imagine any blockages, imbalances, or stuck emotions releasing and flowing out. Continue for several breaths.

**Step 4:** Bring to mind all the people who have contributed to who you are. Parents, family members, teachers, friends, lovers, mentors, even those who challenged you. Recognize that you are the sum of all these relationships. Your I Am was created through connection.

**Step 5:** Speak aloud or internally: "I exist through relationship. I am who I am because of everyone I've met. I honor the web of connection that creates me." Feel how this is true, how you are not separate and isolated but intimately interwoven with countless others.

**Step 6:** Now assess your balance between giving and receiving. Do you tend to give too much and receive too little? Do you take from others but struggle to give? Or do you maintain a healthy flow in both directions? Just notice your pattern without judgment.

**Step 7:** If you tend to over-give (exhausting yourself, depleting your resources, unable to say no), visualize your pancreas drawing energy in, receiving nourishment. Practice receiving: "I allow myself to receive. I am worthy of support. I can take in without guilt. I open to being nourished by others."

**Step 8:** If you tend to over-take (always needing from others, draining people, unable to give back), visualize your pancreas distributing energy outward, sharing your gifts. Practice giving: "I have energy to offer. I give freely from my abundance. I contribute to the flow. I nourish others as I am nourished."

**Step 9:** Now find the balance point. Visualize energy flowing into your plexus (receiving) and flowing out from your plexus (giving) in perfect balance. Breathe in (receive), breathe out (give). In, out. In, out. Feel the natural rhythm of exchange.

**Step 10:** Think of a specific relationship where the energy exchange feels imbalanced. Perhaps you give too much and receive too little with this person, or vice versa. Without judgment, just observe the imbalance.

**Step 11:** Visualize adjusting the flow with this person. If you're over-giving, see yourself pulling back some of your energy, setting a boundary, receiving more. If you're over-taking, see yourself offering more, giving back, contributing to the relationship. Imagine a healthier balance being established.

**Step 12:** Repeat the vibration "Sï" (pronounced like "see" with a slight y-sound: "see-y") three times, feeling the sound resonate in your solar plexus, harmonizing your pancreas and balancing your energy.

**Step 13:** Now speak the statement aloud: "I Am the Path of Connection." Feel the truth of this. Your very existence is connection. You are not separate from the web of life. You are a node in the network, constantly giving and receiving, existing through relationship.

**Step 14:** Bring awareness to any emotional energy stored in your plexus—butterflies, anxiety, grief, joy, whatever is there. These are emotions connected to your relationships, to how you feel about others and how they feel about you. Don't push the emotions away. Allow them to be processed, to flow through, to be converted into usable energy or released.

**Step 15:** Rest in the state of balanced plexus energy. Your pancreas is functioning perfectly, regulating your blood sugar, processing your food, distributing energy throughout your system. Your I Am is strong and integrated. And your I Am exists in healthy relationship with all others—giving and receiving in balance, connected without losing yourself, individual without being isolated.

### Closing

Gently remove your hands from your belly and take a few deep breaths into your solar plexus, noticing how this area feels now. More open? More balanced? More energized?

Place your hands on your belly and speak words of gratitude: "Thank you, pancreas, for processing my energy. Thank you, solar plexus, for creating my I Am. Thank you, relationships, for making me who I am."

Journal about your experience. Where are you in the balance between giving and receiving? With whom do you have the most balanced exchanges? With whom are exchanges most imbalanced? How does it feel to recognize that you exist through relationship? How might you restore healthy flow in your connections?

Throughout the day, notice the constant exchange of energy in every interaction. When someone smiles at you, you receive energy. When you help someone, you give energy. Notice how this feels in your plexus. Practice conscious balance—neither depleting yourself through excessive giving nor draining others through excessive taking.

## Integration

Throughout the day, practice awareness of giving and receiving. In every interaction, notice: Am I giving energy? Receiving energy? Is this balanced? Don't judge, just observe. See if you can feel the flow in your solar plexus.

Work consciously with food and eating. Before you eat, acknowledge that you're taking the life of plants or animals into yourself to be transformed into your own life. Feel gratitude for this exchange. As you digest, be aware that your pancreas and digestive system are working to convert this food into you. This physical process mirrors the energetic process of taking in experiences and relationships and converting them into your I Am.

If you notice blood sugar crashes or spikes (physical or emotional), investigate what's happening relationally and emotionally, not just physically. Are you giving too much energy and depleting yourself? Are you not taking in enough nourishment (emotional or physical)? Are you overwhelmed by what you're trying to process? The pancreas responds to emotional and energetic states as well as physical food.

Examine your closest relationships through the lens of give and receive. Is the exchange balanced? If not, what needs to shift? This doesn't mean perfect 50/50 in every interaction, but over time, healthy relationships have a flow in both directions. If you're always giving and never receiving with someone, that's not sustainable. If you're always taking and never giving back, that's also imbalanced.

Challenge the belief that you should be completely self-sufficient and independent. Recognize that needing others, wanting connection, giving and receiving support—these are not weaknesses. They are the fundamental nature of existence. All beings exist through relationship. Practice allowing yourself to need, to receive, to be in the flow.

If you have pancreatic or blood sugar issues, along with appropriate medical care, work energetically with the solar plexus. Address imbalances in giving and receiving. Explore whether there's a lack of love or emotional nourishment in your life. Open to receiving what you need. Allow energy to flow through you rather than getting stuck.

## Q&A

**Q: I have diabetes or blood sugar issues. Is this always related to emotional imbalance?**

**A:** No. Diabetes and other pancreatic/blood sugar conditions have complex causes including genetics, autoimmune factors (Type 1), lifestyle factors, and other physical components. While there may be energetic and emotional factors that contribute or that can support healing, never blame yourself for a medical condition or think it's solely caused by your emotional state. Work on all levels: appropriate medical care for the physical body, energetic and emotional work for the subtle bodies, and recognize that these approaches complement rather than replace each other.

**Q: Doesn't Buddhism teach non-attachment and not needing others? Isn't that contradicting this teaching about existing through relationship?**

**A:** There's a subtle but crucial difference between non-attachment and non-connection. Non-attachment means not clinging, not being controlled by desire or fear, not losing yourself in relationship. But this doesn't mean cutting off from relationship or pretending you don't need anyone. Even the most enlightened beings exist in relationship—they have teachers, students, communities. The Buddha had a sangha. Non-attachment means you can be fully in relationship without clinging or aversion, without losing your center. This is exactly what balanced solar plexus energy allows: deep connection without losing your I Am, giving and receiving without attachment to outcomes.

**Q: How can I tell if I'm giving too much or if someone is taking too much from me?**

**A:** Check your energy and your plexus. After interacting with someone, do you feel depleted, exhausted, drained? That's often a sign you're giving too much or they're taking too much. Do you feel resentful? That's a sign you're giving more than you truly want to. Healthy giving feels good—you have enough to share and you genuinely want to contribute. If you're giving from obligation, fear, or depletion, that's imbalanced. Notice also if the other person ever reciprocates, ever gives back in any form. If it's always one direction with someone, that's imbalanced. Trust your body's signals—your plexus will tell you when something is off.

**Q: I grew up learning I have to be completely independent and never need anyone. How do I shift this?**

**A:** This is a common cultural pattern, especially in Western individualistic societies. Start small. Practice asking for small helps and accepting them. Notice when someone offers support and instead of automatically saying "I'm fine, I don't need anything," pause and consider actually accepting. Let someone buy you coffee, help you carry something, listen to your problem. Notice how it feels to receive—there may be discomfort, guilt, or fear. Breathe through it. Recognize that allowing others to give to you is actually a gift to them—it allows them to be in the flow too. Gradually, you can expand your capacity to receive and to acknowledge your genuine needs.

**Q: What's the difference between healthy interdependence and unhealthy codependence?**

**A:** In healthy interdependence, you maintain your I Am, your sense of self, your boundaries, while also being in genuine connection. You can give and receive freely. You support others but not at the expense of yourself. You receive support without losing your autonomy. Each person remains whole while being in relationship. In unhealthy codependence, boundaries are blurred, identities are merged, one person's needs consistently override the other's, there's enabling of dysfunction, and one or both people lose their sense of self in the relationship. Healthy interdependence happens between two whole people. Codependence is two half-people trying to make one whole. The solar plexus work is about becoming whole yourself while opening to authentic connection.

**Q: Why do I feel nauseous or get digestive issues when I'm emotionally stressed?**

**A:** The solar plexus and digestive system are intimately connected to the autonomic nervous system and emotional processing. When you're emotionally stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed, your body goes into sympathetic (fight-or-flight) mode. This diverts energy away from digestion—your body doesn't prioritize digesting food when it thinks you're facing a threat. Also, the plexus is where you process emotional energy, and when there's too much to process or energy that can't flow, it gets stuck and manifests as physical symptoms. This is why practices that calm the nervous system and clear emotional energy from the plexus (like today's meditation, breathwork, or therapy) often improve digestive function.

**Q: How does the solar plexus relate to willpower and personal power?**

**A:** The solar plexus is the seat of personal power, will, and the I Am. When this chakra is balanced and the pancreas is functioning well, you have steady energy available, which translates to the ability to take action, to assert your will, to show up powerfully in the world. You have a strong sense of self and the energy to manifest your intentions. When the plexus is weak or imbalanced, you may feel powerless, lack motivation, be unable to assert yourself, or have trouble taking action. Building plexus energy through practices like this meditation, appropriate boundaries, balanced giving and receiving, and healthy self-esteem strengthens your willpower and personal power.

**Q: Can working with the solar plexus help me set better boundaries?**

**A:** Absolutely. The solar plexus governs your sense of self and your ability to know what belongs to you and what doesn't—which is the foundation of boundaries. When your plexus is weak, you may not know where you end and others begin, making boundaries unclear or non-existent. When your plexus is strong, you have a clear sense of your I Am, which makes it natural to know what you will accept and what you won't, what's yours to handle and what isn't. Strengthening the solar plexus through meditation, affirmations of I Am, balancing give and receive, and honoring your own needs and wants will naturally improve your capacity for healthy boundaries.
