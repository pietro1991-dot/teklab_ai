## Overview

Today we close the Aries Emotional Week with victory—but not the victory we've been taught. Most humans understand victory as winning over others, having power over someone else, defeating enemies, one person rising while another falls. This is not victory. This is defeat.

True victory is something completely different: the energy of life seeking balance. Through examining the false symbols we use, the etymology of the word itself, and the natural patterns found everywhere from atoms to ecosystems, we'll discover that victory is not about domination but about energy exchange, mutual need, and the fundamental pattern of life itself.

This teaching challenges both our cultural symbols and our political ideologies, revealing that nature operates on principles far more sophisticated than human governments have yet achieved.

## Core Teaching

### The False Symbol of Victory

When people make the "V" sign with two fingers, they often call it "the peace sign." It is not a symbol of peace. According to history (possibly from the Hundred Years' War between England and France), this symbol came from the British winning the war with two fingers—using arrows and bows. When they released arrows, they made this gesture.

The symbol means: "We won upon the other one." It's a symbol of defeat, not peace. One side defeated the other. That's not peace—it's dominance.

To transcend this symbol of division and power over others, some (including Roy Littleton and others Matias has worked with) propose a different symbol: all fingers together, unified. This represents unity, equality in all parts, no one above or below, balance rather than dominance.

### Etymology: Nike, Victory, and Via

For the Romans, Victory was the goddess—a lady with wings flying around, controlling territory and spreading the dominance of the Roman Empire. For the Greeks, she was Nike, goddess of victory. (Yes, the shoe brand uses this name.) Nike and Victory have the same etymology, even though they sound different.

Both come from the Indo-European root: Via. Via means energy and strength. Victory talks about the energy and strength someone must have to win over others, to take power over others. In the old understanding, you needed energy and strength to defeat enemies, control territory, and dominate cultures.

### The Path to Victory: Competition → Desire → Win

To understand victory, we must trace the path: Competition → Desire → Win → Victory.

Competition comes from "com" (with) and "petition" (to ask for something, to look for something). Competition means to ask for something or look for something WITH others. Not AGAINST others. WITH others.

Desire is what you're looking for, the thing you wish for, the thing you need.

Win comes from "when," meaning desire. To win means to get what you desire.

Once you get what you desire (win), you reach victory. Victory is the energy (Via) that comes from getting what you desired with others.

### The Atomic Model: Competition as Seeking Together

Imagine different particles: electron (negative charge), proton (positive charge), neutron (neutral). Each has different energy, different charges. They NEED each other. They are looking for (competing for) the desire—the energy they lack.

When they come together, they create energy, magnetic field, and victory (the life of the atom). They're not fighting AGAINST each other. They're seeking WITH each other.

The same pattern repeats throughout all levels of existence. Molecules seek each other to create chemical reactions (victory equals energy exchange). Cells seek nutrients from each other to survive (victory equals feeding). Organs share proteins, data, and cells to function (victory equals life of the organism). Plants and insects interact—the plant needs the insect, the insect needs the plant (victory equals pollination and feeding). Animals interact—predator and prey, male and female (victory equals reproduction and survival).

All beings are looking for something they NEED to fill their void. When they share this energy, they feed themselves. That sharing is victory.

### Victory Equals Life

Victory is not defeating others. Victory IS life. Victory means the energy of life.

Nature uses two systems in balance: capitalism (the exchange of energy—each organism creates and seeks energy, trades with others) and communism (the administration of energy within communities—cells share within an organism). Capitalism is how nature exchanges energy between organisms. Communism is how nature administrates energy within organisms (communities of cells working together). Both are necessary. Both work together.

### Why Human Systems Fail

The problem with human communism and capitalism is that we have governments. Nature doesn't have governments. Nature is free, libertarian by design. Organisms and cells interact by resonance to one another. They don't need anyone telling them what to do. They interact because they NEED each other.

Any system—from any belief—that puts aside hunger, that doesn't allow beings to reach energy, HAS FAILED. That system doesn't work because nature can only be victorious.

For a system to be victorious: No one from above should be giving energy to others. Each cell must create its own energy. Cells share energy through resonance, not force.

The only reason individuals cannot create their own energy is because some people above hold their energy to take power. And usually, it's not the rich people. It's not about rich people holding poor people. It's about people threatened by losing control—who don't have to be rich. It's about the ones who want to have control.

### The Failure of Ideologies

One of the biggest mistakes in human systems is believing there can be a system that gives energy to some parts that don't generate energy. This is nature. Not philosophy. Not ideology. Just nature.

When communism and socialism fail (by creating dependency, removing incentive to generate energy), they give power to capitalism that destroys everything. Pure capitalism (without communal administration) becomes exploitation, hoarding, imbalance, and destruction.

Victory in life can only work when capitalism and communism work coherently together as one. Nature uses both: between organisms, capitalism (exchange); within organisms, communism (sharing). Neither ideology alone. Both in balance.

### To Be Victorious Does Not Equal To Be Rich

To be victorious is not to be rich. Victory equals having the energy to live, to create, to exchange. Rich or poor is irrelevant.

Victory means each being has access to the energy they need. When ANY being is denied access to energy (food, resources, opportunity), the system has failed. Nature doesn't allow failure. Nature is victorious. If a system creates starvation, energy deprivation, or blocked flow—it's not natural, it's broken.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Become aware of breath, body, space.

### Main Practice

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark. Bring this light to your toroid field (the eternal field around your body).

Feel yourself as part of the network of life. You are not separate. You are seeking WITH others, not against them.

Ask: "What energy am I seeking? What do I need?"

Now see the truth: You're not competing AGAINST anyone. You're looking for something WITH everyone. The electron needs the proton. The proton needs the electron. Who do you need? What energy can you exchange?

Sound: Rh

I am eternal wisdom. I am eternal wisdom. I am eternal wisdom.

I am. I am. I am.

Feel the energy flowing: from you to others, from others to you. Victory in the exchange. Not domination. Not defeat. Balance. Life. Energy.

### Closing

Recognize: Victory is life itself. Wherever life flows, victory exists. Wherever energy is blocked, victory is denied. Your role: Allow the energy to flow, exchange, balance.

Breathe deeply. Stretch. Yawn. Return to here and now.

## Key Insights

- The "V" peace sign is actually a symbol of defeat (winning over others), not peace
- True unity symbol: All parts together equally, no one above/below
- Nike (Greek) and Victory (Roman) have same etymology from "Via" (energy and strength)
- Competition (com+petition) means to look for something WITH others, not AGAINST them
- Path to victory: Competition (seeking WITH others) → Desire (what you need) → Win (get it) → Victory (energy from getting it)
- Atomic model: Electron/proton/neutron NEED each other, seek together, create energy equals victory
- Pattern repeats: molecules, cells, organs, plants/insects, animals—all seeking WITH each other to fill voids
- Victory equals life itself; the energy of life seeking balance
- Nature uses both capitalism (exchange between organisms) and communism (administration within organisms)
- Human systems fail when governments control instead of allowing natural resonance/interaction
- Any system that creates hunger/blocks energy access has FAILED—nature is only victorious
- To be victorious does not equal to be rich; it means having access to needed energy
- No one from above should give energy; each cell must create own energy and share through resonance
- People who want control (not necessarily rich) block others' energy to maintain power
- Neither communism/socialism nor pure capitalism alone works; both together in balance equals nature's way

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

When you see "competition" today, reframe it. Not: "I'm competing AGAINST them." But: "We're seeking something TOGETHER, each from our own need."

Notice where energy flows freely in your life, and where it's blocked. Flowing: Gratitude, exchange, reciprocity, balance (victory). Blocked: Hoarding, control, dependency, deprivation (defeat). Your work: Remove blocks, allow flow.

### Applying This Teaching

Whether you lean capitalist or socialist/communist, ask: "Am I creating a system where: (1) Each being can generate their own energy? (2) Energy is shared/administered within communities? (3) Energy is exchanged between communities? (4) No one from above controls the flow? (5) Interaction happens through resonance, not force?"

If yes to all: Victory (life). If no to any: Defeat (system failure).

Recognize that Aries Emotional Week is complete. We've journeyed from the crown to the eternal field, learning that wisdom in the emotional realm means understanding the energy dynamics of anger, struggle, fury, independence, advancement, and victory—not as problems to eliminate, but as life forces to understand and work with.

## Q&A

### Q: How can competition be "with" others when we're fighting for limited resources?

That's scarcity thinking (artificial limitation). In nature, when true scarcity exists, organisms adapt, migrate, or transform. The fight isn't AGAINST each other—it's WITH each other to find what all need. The electron doesn't hate the proton for having positive charge; it NEEDS it.

### Q: Doesn't this ignore real oppression and injustice?

No. Oppression happens when someone blocks the natural flow of energy—prevents others from generating/accessing what they need. That's the OPPOSITE of victory (life). Justice means restoring the flow.

### Q: Can capitalism and communism really work together?

They do in nature constantly. Your body is proof: Cells WITHIN an organ share resources (communism). Organs BETWEEN each other exchange resources (capitalism). No ideology. Just function.

### Q: What if I don't have the energy I need to compete?

Then someone is blocking your access, or the system is broken. In a victorious (living) system, every cell can generate energy. If you can't, investigate what's blocking you—internal or external.

### Q: How is victory "eternal wisdom"?

Because the pattern of energy exchange creating life is eternal—it happens at every level, from atoms to galaxies. Understanding this pattern is understanding the eternal mechanics of existence.

### Q: What's the practical takeaway for my life?

Ask: "Am I seeking to WIN OVER others (defeat)? Or seeking to EXCHANGE WITH others (victory)? Am I generating my own energy and sharing it? Or depending on controllers to give it to me? Am I allowing natural flow, or forcing/blocking it?"

### Q: Why end Aries week with victory instead of starting with it?

Because you can only understand true victory AFTER you've understood struggle, fury, independence, and advancement. Victory isn't the beginning—it's what happens when all those forces find balance and flow. It's the culmination, the eternal wisdom that emerges from embodying all previous lessons.
