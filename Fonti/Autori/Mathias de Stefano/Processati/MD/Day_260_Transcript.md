## Introduction

Hi everyone! Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So let 's begin with our topic for today closing the emotional week of areas. Just to remind you all and for you to know , today has begun the Tours , the constellation of Tours , today has begun the period of Tours , and astrological talking. But we are going to begin with our physical week of areas , because remember that we are not following the astrological days , we are following the Atlantic calendar.

So of course , just to take an account , we are beginning with the energy of Tours in the environment.

So let 's close with the emotional week of areas , so we can begin with the physical week of areas.

So let 's go to the topic for today , which is Victory. Victory , let 's speak for according to the symbol of Victory. For us today from the human perspective , Victory would be something wrong. And why?

## Q&A

Because Victory , when people ask the symbol of Victory , is related to be upon others , like when you were able to win over the others. And this means that you have more power or the other people lose on their week or whatever.

So it 's kind of an idea of someone getting upon the other one.

So that 's why I say it 's negative because it speaks about the power of one person erasing the power of other one.

So as I mistake , this symbol has become like the symbol of peace , but this is not a symbol of peace. This symbol usually is related to someone that won a war. And that 's why now there is peace , but not because the two parts were in peace , it 's just because some of them won upon the other.

So according to a story , I do n't know if literally is true , but that 's what I 've read about it. Is that one of the stories from where this came from , this symbol came from is from the war of 100 years in between England and France. And they kind of got this symbol because the British won the war with two fingers. With arrows and boats.

Okay , so that 's why when they release the arrows was like this , okay , so.

So this symbol became like we won upon the other one.

So this is defeat is not peace , okay.

So some some people have been using another symbol to transcend this symbol from this , which is. Division and power from on the others to this symbol , which is the unity and equality in all the ports.

So that 's the symbol , I do n't know if you can see it properly.

So it 's not this is this. I usually do this mood Roman. I 'm working with energy or also in the pictures , so maybe if you see me like this. You will see it.

So this has been a message that we have been sharing with and we talked about with Roy Littleton from the States and in Sha. And I think that it 's very coherent symbol.

So as you have seen , the symbols of peace and the symbols of victory are both of them , which are the same. Both of them related to the defeat upon other is not the peace is about defeat.

So victory was also a symbol as a goddess for the civilizations that were empires. The ones that believed on the power upon others , like controlling territory , other cultures and so on.

So victory was like this great symbol of winning upon winning over the others.

So for the Romans , victory was the symbol of this lady that had wings and that were that was flying around the territory like controlling and putting the dominance of the Roman Empire over the other cultures.

So for the great people was also the same for the great people was the goddess victory was called Nike. Nike is the goddess of victory and Nike and victory has the same etymology , even if they sound really different , they have exactly the same etymology. And I will I will speak about it just as a curious thing. Nike the goddess of victory for Greece is the actual name that the brand of shoes sneakers is using which is Nike.

So.

So that 's the name.

So victory Nike come from the same in the European word which is Via. And Via means energy and strength. And energy and strength. Actually this means that this is the victory talks about the energy and strength that someone has to have in order to win over the others to take the power on others.

They needed energy and strength. How does it take to the victory? Because Ghana. Ghana.

How do we get into victory? Well , because someone wins. And we come from the word when that means the sire. For someone to accomplish victory has to win.

And what is win comes from when that means the sire. And of course , in order to win , we have to go through to competition.

So why it means competition competition means with and ask for something or look for something.

So the concept means to ask for something or to look for something with others.

So as you see here , this is a concept that is really important to rethink about.

So. Usually when we hear the word competition. We try to win something against others. But the etymology of competition is saying that we are looking for something with others.

Can you see the difference? And of course what you are looking for is something that you decide that the sire. That you wish for it.

So once you you got that thing that you desire. You run. And it 's in that moment when I get the victory. Meaning the energy.

So let 's see this story. Compete the sire victory.

So to compete is to set intention to look for something with others. The sire is the things that we want.

So the things we win is to win. And once we got that we reach victory.

So let 's see it in a different way.

So if we see it in this way , we will see that here we have different aspects that are looking for something. What they are looking for is this connection , this main energy. That is the need , the sire. And we reach victory when those two get together and light with energy.

So let 's call this an atom for example.

So think about this as an atom. Imagine that one is an electron , proton and neutron.

So each one of this has a different , completely different energy. Different charges.

Some of them negative like the electrons , some of them positive like the proton.

So each one of them has one type of energy and they need the other one. They are in need of the other one in order to exist to manifest.

So that 's why all of them are looking for that energy , which is they are the sire , the things that they do n't have.

So they will get together to reach the desire , the need. And when they go together , they create energy and magnetic field.

So now imagine that there are many different things like molecules.

So they will look for another molecules in order to create a magnetic field and energy. We have here many chemical components. They look to make a reaction. And here we have the chemical reaction of that gathering of that desire.

So another way , for example , is when we have.

So imagine that these are different cells and the cells they need energy to live.

So they look in between one another , the things that they need. They get together because of other sire. And when they share this energy. They feed themselves.

The same thing happened with the organs. Many cells together. Different organs share data , share cells , share proteins. Because they have the desire to take data information in order to survive and transcend.

So they start to take action energy in order to act. Same thing when we go bigger individuals like a plant , an insect , an animal. The plant needs to insect and insect will be the plant. The animal will be the plant , the insect , whatever.

So they all need something. They all are looking for something that they need to feed their void. And that will give them energy to live. Same thing will happen with individuals like monkeys.

It one of these dogs are monkeys. To masculine one feminine for example. And this two masculine will compete for the feminine because they have a desire to have sex for what? To have a baby to keep going in the reproduction in the constant movement of life.

Also we can have these individuals that they just want to play. To play because they have the desire of getting fun.

So by laughing they create energy. Or we can also say that here we have some people that had a project or they are in love. And they have this desire of doing things for the world and they get together in order to accomplish their mission.

So what do you see of this system? That in every level we have different individuals with different charges of energy , different ways that they had a desire. And they have to get together to try to solve this desire in order to accomplish their goals.

So what is the goal? The goal is to gain energy for the next cycle.

So this repeats ones and again , ones and again. We call this the cycle of life.

So what I want to say about this is that everything in nature is competing in order to win energy. Let 's go step by step. Everything in nature competes in order to win energy to earn energy.

So there are many ways to compete.

So everything is competing.

Now we can understand from this way to different subjects that are running in order to gain this here. Or we have another different way , which is this one.

So we have two different ways in which this one 's here run in order to get the same thing for themselves or many that put their own energy in order to create the one that we are looking for.

So basically , in nature , the organisms work in the second way. The second way will be that tiny little parts of the nature , they get together to create an organism so they can earn or gain better energy.

So we can see here that usually nature creates networks in order to create a better competition.

So what it means to compete , remember , everything in the universe is in the nature is trying to earn energy to gain energy.

So competition is about that. The problem that we humans have is that we see the competition as if it is a war when it is not that. This is the work , the teamwork in order to gain the victory or to reach the victory which is energy. Let 's go to the basics.

And electron and the pros and they do n't get together because they love each other. I 'm sorry to kill the magic here with love , but they do n't get together because they love each other. And electron and electron and one person they get together because each one of them has something that the other one needs.

So they get together because of that because they need to share energy.

So once they are together they realize that they can reach much more energy together than being alone.

So they start to compete. Being together and they start to create bigger organisms in order to reach much more energy.

So every day we become more complex organisms.

So the question here would be , so what 's the end of all this? When do we reach victory? Well , never is constant is eternal. The competition never ends in existence.

So for example here we can say that the universe is a line of dots.

So this line of dots is constant in the universe.

So this means that all the dots are one line. But each one of these dots is unique is an individual inside this constant.

So we can say here that each one of these dots is like an individual.

So this is a life and then we die alive and die. Each space here is like death. And then we have a light.

So it 's a constant life but separated in different stages.

So this also can say that each one of these dots represents a beginning and an end beginning and beginning and beginning and beginning.

So we can say here that life is a constant of beginnings and ends.

So we can understand here that each one of these individuals is looking to accomplish the mission to begin a new one. And then again , another mission to begin a new one. And this is a constant keeps going all the time.

So we can say for example that we can say for example that all this path that we take throughout our life and life 's life is a competition to reach victory. But the truth is that the universe , it does n't exist like this. It 's a constant.

So each one of these spots here is a victory by itself. And this explains that victory is basically to gain energy for the next step and then gain energy for the next step.

So now this system can show us that victory is everywhere because it means to gain energy to move forward in the next step. Like for example , easy example. You usually eat three times a day. You take breakfast , you have lunch and then dinner.

So imagine that one of this is breakfast , the other one is lunch , the other one is dinner. What we are doing here is to gain energy. Our victory is the breakfast.

So we can push our energy for a few hours and then we take another victory which is lunch and then we move for another hours and then we take another victory which is. Dinner and so on.

So those are victory for the body. Then you go to sleep. And that 's gaining much more energy is another victory when you rest and then you wake up on the cycle starts again.

So we eat and sleep to keep following the path. Every day we repeat the same every month , every week , every year. And that 's how we are victorious in each one of the steps.

So from this point of view we can understand that all life is basically victory because is the path to gain energy.

So this means that basically we do n't do all these things to reach the victory to accomplish victory. Is opposite. Everything that we do in our life that gives us energy is victory. From the point of view of the body , from biology , every time that you can sleep , every time that you get to eat , every day.

And the time that you can drink. Is that it?

So I just wanted to wrap this idea with a mistake that we usually as humans do , which is to separate communism with capitalism. Like two things. When it 's not like that. Let 's go from this point of view about capitalism and communism in nature to understand about this victory.

First of all , this strikes on the standards. Nature is capitalism. Nature is capitalism. Whether you like it or not , it 's like that.

Why? Because every particle in the universe is exchanging energy. And when something is exchanging , some kind of energy is capitalism. Because it 's exchanging data.

And the reason why this particles get together is in order to exchange it better. And to gain much more opportunities to get much more energy. That 's why complex organisms appear like we do from a bacteria to a human. It 's capitalismistic.

Okay. The thing here is that nature in order to administrated this capitalism uses the system of communism , which is that they administrated all these goods of energy in communities that we call , and we are going to use the system of the human.

So they are common to one another. They share as organisms. The capitalism is the system that the nature uses to exchange energy. And the communism is the system that they do in order to administrated that energy.

So this is why victory in life can only work when capitalism and communism work in coherent together as one. The only problem that we have with communism and capitalism is that we have governments and nature does n't have governments. Because nature is free , is libertarian by nature. The different organisms , the different cells interact by resonance to one another.

The interact by resonance , they do n't need anybody to say to them what to do.

Okay.

So victory is life. Victory means life is the energy of life.

So whatever system it does n't matter from which belief has put aside with hunger and not being able to reach energy. It means that that system has failed. A system like that nature does n't work because nature can only be victorious.

So in order for a system to be victorious , there should not be anyone from above giving energy to others. Each cell must create its own energy. And the only reason why these individuals can not create their own energy is because there is some kind of people above that holds their energy in order to take power. And normally it 's not the rich people.

That 's another thing about victory. To be victorious is not to be rich. The thing here is that it 's not about the rich people that hold poor people. No , it 's about the people that is a threat of losing control , which does n't have to be rich.

It 's about the ones that wants to have to control. One of the biggest mistakes that we can have in our human systems is that they believe that there can be a system that gives energy to some parts. That does n't generate energy. This is nature.

It 's not philosophy or ideology. It 's just nature. This is why usually the philosophies of communism and socialism fail. And when they fail , they give the power to the capitalism that destroys everything.

It 's neither one , neither the other. Victory equal life. The vibration for today is. .
