## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good evening , good night.

So today we connect with a third eye in the physical aspect.

So I would like to remind you that we are still in the process of Virgo , even if in the tropical astrology we are already in the process of Libre. I remind you that we are not doing astrology with this , what we are following is the concepts of the constellations.

So this is why we are still for another nine days in the concept of Virgo.

## Q&A

So in the process of Virgo , the nine days that we have left , we will have to keep doing our analyzing process , all the analysis every day. If I 'm not watching to straight to your eyes and I 'm watching around , it 's because I 'm trying to read the chat if I get some questions or something to fly a fight. Or because I 'm just trying to watch that everything is working here in this. And also because the camera is up there and when I just look at the camera , I get bored and I do n't know what to say.

This is why I 'm looking anywhere.

So today , third eye.

Today I wrote about context. And this is the issue related to the third eye today.

So in order to understand what it means , we have to go to the symbology of the word.

So remember that it comes from the Latin and context from the word , which is , which is , which means all together , different parts together , the conjunction. And the text , the other part of the word , means textiles comes from the word textiles that is related with , that it means textiles in Latin means tissue , okay. And then it 's connected with tissue , something that is connected or waved. That 's the meaning.

And this idea means that context is everything that sets together or all the things that get together to be connected or in like in a tissue , okay. A tissue , it says , yeah.

So we today think that the word context is talking about something that is around , around something that is happening. But the origin of the word is not about the things that happens around is about how everything is entangled , how everything is connected in like a textile , text , in like a textile production. Where everything is waved and connected from within and outside. I know this , we have to understand that context is not something that just happens around the subject that is happening.

But it 's also all those things that prepare that also take part on the shaping of the inside of what you are , okay. By spirituality when you start to do all this path of spirituality , we usually make a kind of mistake because it 's not precisely wrong. But we kind of do a mistake thinking that the context that everything that is around , that everything that is outside is just objection from the inside.

Okay , so what you have inside is the thing that creates everything in the outside.

So whatever happens around me is just a projection from me.

So that 's kind of the of the thing of the thinking that we that we have that we usually make.

So what I was trying to say is that when we start to make this path of spirituality and we start to understand that everything has been created by the I am and I am that concept.

So when I go inside to myself , I connect with the concept of I am creator.

So suddenly I would say if I am the creator is because I am creating everything.

So everything that happens to me in my life is created by me by my inner self. But it 's not precisely like that and this is what I 'm going to explain.

So take this idea that when I connect with the I am and I say I am the creator. I 'm not speaking about me. It 's not Matthias the creator is the I am the creator and Matthias is just I not I am is I.

So if it 's I me , it 's just I could it 's another projection. It 's another projection of the reality.

So it 's a it 's just one of the others that were created.

So this means that the I am is the creator but I am a projection of the I am.

So just keep following this concept. I will keep going with other issues.

So basically if I am a projection from the I am I am just I one of the many I that I that I am has created. I have created one of the many projections. This means that myself is also one of the streams one of the parts that creates the tissue of the whole of the whole creation.

So this means that we are part of the context.

So when I say context , I am speaking about all the tissues , all the connections that were projected from the I am.

So this means that everyone that exists you me everyone that we exist we are all context. The I am is the center of this great context.

So this means that I am also a consequence.

So what this means that myself I am part of the tissue so whoever is moving around will move myself to because this is a spider web where we are all connected and stick there. We are part of the streams of this network.

So this means that when someone is completely connected with the concept of the I am in each one of the cells is being able to transform the context of the reality. But when someone is not connected with the I am is just connected with the personality.

So the context will transform and condition myself.

So we would say that when I know how an object works I will be able to handle the object. But if I have no idea how this object works this object will condition my reality.

So imagine this picture imagine that the I am is like a spider that had wave a whole net around and every one of the I of the cells we are like the flies stick in that net.

So basically this means that all of us the flies we are stick in this net and when one of them one of the flies to move like trying to escape all the rest will feel the same vibration because it 's all connected in the net. When we are only related with the I just I am conditioned by the context of the movement of the net. If the spider web starts to move so I am stick there so I will move also so this means that the whole net will start to violate and condition the rest so this network is called the context. And the spider would be the I am.

The only moment when you are not trapped in the network and you are able to control the context and to create your own reality is when the fly remembers that it also is the spider.

So it 's in that moment when the flies remember that it is also the spider when she starts to wave its own network and create its own reality.

So I hope that with this example of the insects and the attack needs or we could understand what it means to be conditioned by the context.

So basically we could picture this image that when we are in the spiritual world we are the spider and suddenly when we start to go to life and to be burned. But we do is to become a fly.

So we start to be stacked in the net in the spider web.

So this means that when we go into the net into the spider web and we are born in the spider web all the other flies that lives already in this net starts to violate and the net makes me violate in the same symphony.

So everything that is around starts to condition my reality. The context will shape my own reality.

So this meant go into the matrix into this reality starts to condition our self , our own vibration. The context starts to modify our reality. This is why it 's so important to understand the context if we are born.

So it starts to condition what we are because it starts to violate. The context starts to violate.

So condition my vibration because the net is all connected.

So basically we have first a process of awakening and when you awake for the first time you see the network around the matrix and the first thing you said is like , oh my god , I am a fly.

So I have to escape from the network. I have to escape from the matrix. I have to escape from this context that is crazy. I will die here.

So the spider web is a trumpet being a fly.

So you have to escape the matrix. But the thing is that when you violate faster and harder in order to escape the matrix the spider web.

So we all know that the spider will find you easily. And there 's the other thinking that you say , no , I am the creator of this reality.

So I can not be I can not be conditioned by the context. The context can not condition me. I am the one able to create my own context. Everything comes from me.

But you still are a fly. You are still being a fly.

So usually when we start with this spiritual path what we usually do is to say around that no , I am the creator of I network. I am the creator of this. But I defend the creation of this network from the perspective of a fly.

So what I am just doing with that is making a mistake thinking that the fly is the one created in the network. And I do n't know if you know that but flies do n't know how to make a spider web.

So the mistake that we usually do is to create that the eye is the one able to create a network. When the eye is just projection towards the network condition by the network because the eye is the network.

So in order to to transcend to go into another level of awareness what the flies must do is to recognize themselves as flies. And to realize that when they all connected and when they all put together the network and they say , hey , we are flies. But they all recognize the network that they have created suddenly they will become the spider. To understand that I am the spider that we all are the spider is to realize that all the matrix the spider web that that we felt that we were trapped on.

We created it was it was the spider who created that.

So for the spider the spider web the net is not a tram. The spider is a home.

So basically until we as flies do n't recognize ourselves as flies. I we can not enter in resonance , violate in harmony.

So when we all start to violate in harmony we become the network.

So we become the spider.

So we have to acknowledge that it 's not simple as saying everything that is within me is the one that creates the outside. And I am the creator of all that. It 's not that simple. And the reason why it 's not as simple as that is because what I consider my inner aspect the creator one that shaped the outside is also part of this context that was protect.

So this is why what we have to recognize to our knowledge is how can we find the perfect vibration in order to be in the same harmony.

So we could create in harmony with the rest.

So it 's important to understand this because when we enter in the spiritual path sometimes we hear really good sentences that makes us understand the great things. But then in the past is we we just has as a result tiny things. This means that there 's only one creator. And that creator the I am is divided in thousands of parts that is each one of us.

So in order to create we need to be in harmony with all the other parts.

So the thing is if I do n't realize that I am part of that network of the I am. And I can not be in balance with the context and only by being balanced with the context that I am part of I am going to be able to create my own reality because I am with many. And that 's what we call co creation. Co creation is not something from one only self from one being.

Co creation is not my yes creating in reality to co create myself. I need of all of you. Co creation means I need many to create. But the only way in which I am able to co create is if I am in balance and harmony in the same vibration as all of you.

That 's why when we start to say we want to create an earth. And we have to create a new world. We have to acknowledge and recognize from where are we activating that. Because it 's not as easy as the sentence says if you think it you created.

So in order to create something in the outside. It 's not just to say if I think it I do it or I create it. No , I think it. And then I have to project it , to sign it.

Then I have to say it , express it. Then I have to share it from the heart. Then I have to become it in the plexus. Then I have to balance my two creation forces.

Then I have to be able to be here. And now they 're depressing myself. Then in Dense , I have to see and through it from all the past aspects of my life. And then in the feet , I have to recognize if I am focused in where I am heading to all the charts.

So it 's not just think it and do it. It 's a long job. And all of these charts are conditioned by the tissues , strings of this net.

So the first vibration that modified the , the streams that creates vibration with the context connected to the context was the first time when I realized. About what was context.

So basically the task for today is to recognize the first memories that shaped your life forever. And that process has to be done between the moment you were born until you 're seven years old. Inside the period of time , you have to remember which were the first context in which you were lived. Where , where were you?

How was to live that context? What are the things that you lived? The first things that you remember in your life as a child. And , and do n't tell me I ca n't remember because that 's not like that.

It 's just your brain right now trying to not remember , but everyone can remember the first context of life. The mind usually tries to defend itself from memories that she does n't consider useful. I invite you to maybe take your walk to think about it , to mediate about it , to just think about the , or to act to other people from your family or just to try to remember what I have done , what , where your first memories from your life.

Sometimes it can also be just , just smells that awaken memories. And also we are not talking here about go to the past just to , to heal your history to no , nothing. We 're not healing anything here. We 're not trying to heal anything because what we are just trying to do here is to acknowledge the first memories that I have of my context , being aware of what was around me , because those perceptions are the ones that molded the way in which I relate with the context today.

Okay , so if you did n't got anything just listen to this again , because we have to go to the alignment.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the task is to write it down , not think about it , write it down. We are in Virgo , do n't be lazy , we have to write it down. That 's the vibration of the day , saw it.

So the statement for today is I am agree of thoughts.

## Daily Code

So the code of today , the information that we have around is also related with the issue that we discussed yesterday , which is the soul pattern , V. Every end of a cycle , the highest transformation is found there. V represents the inevitable pattern of the end , closure of a cycle , everything behind and stepping into a completely new reality. Is going from a solid state into a liquid one , then into a gaseous one , to go back into liquid and subsequently into solid.

Death from last point of view is a final , but from eternity 's point of view is a liberation for we are free of forms to become our dreams.

So this is also related with what we have discussed now , which is to recognize that we are all different selves , different eyes around , and the forms. And then when we die , we go back to the concept of the one , so the spider , that is the one that is within dreams.

So let 's go to that. Sit properly , sit comfortable. Stretch the body. Yon.

A brief massage. Wow.

So I leave the way , fall down , focusing just in my breathing. I use my imagination to bring the oxygen through my nose towards the lungs , heart , blood , organs , and muscles. Take your deep breath and become aware of all the cells that shape your body. Travel through your body with imagination to see the billions of spheres that one aside the other create every part of who you are.

Take it to breath and go within your body to find the most beautiful cell you can find. Just picture a beautiful sphere in front of you. Become bigger and bigger until you can touch it and cares it in front of you. This is some other cell.

Take it to breath and feel yourself going inside the cell. Like swimming inside a sea of plasma , touching the chromosomes. I start to feel how I separated watching the strips of NA curling around my fingers and hands. And I acknowledge that inside of it I find the codes that made me be who I am.

Take it to breath. I feel the strips of NA all around my body. I recognize that I am inside a mother cell within the body of my mother. I am an offering heading to the uterus.

## Energy Work

Take it to breath. Take it to breath and contemplate over you and above you picture the eye am coming in a spiral of light in the shape of an espermatoid. I feel this permatoid of the eye am touching the limits of the egg where I find myself. I feel the eye am entering an spiral through my crown.

I feel how the magnetic field of the cell changes , shining with light. I feel here , delight all around the cell , as I become aware that this is the meaning of the unifying process of the eye and am. I feel the spiral of the eye am going through the crown , the third eye , throat , heart , plexus. And from there it lives and release all the material , the genetic material to the scrum , root , knees and ankles.

## Guided Meditation

I inspire and breathe. The information of the eye am , I say recognize that it is this moment in its expansion , where I feel the beginning of my life. As the cell maintains my issue , I see the division of the cell in two. From my perspective , the eye and in front of me , the arm , I am.

Take a deep breath and with the sound start to expand , vibration and the consciousness of the eye am through all the process of my creation.

So , so , so , so , so. I feel the strength of the eye am , start to divide the cells. Take a deep breath and recognize these two cells expanding the consciousness of the eye am as its device from two to four , eight , sixteen. And goes on and on expanding the creation of your body.

So , by deep pronouncing the sound , I see the sound , feel how these cells create the heart , the brain , the lungs , the stomach , the liver , everything within you , standing your organs , muscles , your whole body. I become aware that the dreams of the creator are becoming real , the thoughts are now flesh. I become aware of my hands , my head , arms , legs and feet. I start to go out , seeking for light.

## Energy Work

As you take a deep breath , feel your body , starts to come out of the body of your mouth. From the crown , feeling the light , and now softly , your eyes and ears and nose. The rest of the body stays there inside the mother. As your third eye , starts to contemplate the context of the new world where you are heading to.

I become aware and I recognize I am the greed of thoughts. Take a deep breath and take your hands to your heart. I become aware like this , that all the thoughts of the I am are now becoming my context. For I am that greed of thoughts.

Take a deep breath. I start to massage the body , to bring this consciousness all through the body , stretching , warning , realizing about this light from the ears , the nose , up. Feeling the expansion of this new world you are heading to. I am looking back , opening my eyes here and now.

As always , drink a lot of water and rest. I recognize that as you realize that the context of this reality is creating yourself to be what you are. By that , I connect with the I am to become myself the creator of that new reality. This is why it is so important to recognize the first context that had created me.

Then I am able to create a new one. Good night and see you tomorrow for the third Tucker. Bye.
