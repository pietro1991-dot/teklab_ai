## Overview

Welcome to Day 21, the beginning of the final week of Leo constellation—the physical or body week, where we explore the manifestation of spiritual and emotional energies in our physical form. Today we work with the head, specifically the crown chakra and its physical anchor: the hypophysis gland (pituitary gland).

This teaching clarifies an important point: we are still in the month of Leo even though the astrological calendar may have moved to Virgo. We are following the ancient Atlantean calendar related to the concepts of the constellations, not the astrological timing. The concept of Leo—"I Can"—continues through Day 30.

The hypophysis is a tiny but incredibly important gland located in the center of the brain, in a direct line between the ears. This gland is where the crown chakra anchors into physical reality, where the higher self connects directly with our body. It's the master gland that controls all other glands and maintains homeostasis—the balance of the entire bodily system.

Today's teaching reveals the profound connection between balance, listening, and connection to the higher self. When we are dizzy or lose our balance, it indicates we have forgotten to be harmonious. When we fail to truly listen—to ourselves, to others, to the higher self—it shows disconnection from our spiritual source. The practice of deep, conscious listening is the path to reconnecting with spirit in physical form.

## Core Teaching

### The Hypophysis: Anchor of the Higher Self

The crown chakra is the energy center at the top of the head that connects us to the divine, to higher consciousness, to what we call the higher self. But this chakra, like all chakras, needs an anchor in the physical body—a gland that can translate spiritual energy into biological function.

This anchor is the hypophysis, which English speakers typically call the pituitary gland. The original name "hypophysis" comes from Greek and refers to something that grows beneath (hypo = beneath, physis = growth). It's a more respectful name than "pituitary," which comes from the Latin "pituita" meaning mucus or phlegm, based on the ancient mistaken belief that this gland produced nasal mucus.

The hypophysis is a small gland about the size of a pea, located in a bony cavity at the base of the brain, directly in the center of the head. To locate it, imagine a line connecting your ears—the hypophysis sits at the center of that line, deep in the brain, just below the hypothalamus.

This tiny gland is extraordinarily powerful. It is the master controller of all other endocrine glands in the body. It produces and regulates hormones that tell the thyroid, adrenals, ovaries or testes, and other glands what to do. It controls growth, metabolism, stress response, reproduction, and countless other vital functions.

From a spiritual perspective, this makes perfect sense. The hypophysis is the physical manifestation of the crown chakra—the point where the higher self connects to and controls the body. Just as the crown chakra is the master energy center that influences all other chakras, the hypophysis is the master gland that regulates all other glands. As above, so below. As in energy, so in matter.

### The Principle of Homeostasis

One of the most important functions of the hypophysis is maintaining homeostasis. This term comes from Greek: "homeo" (similar) and "stasis" (standing still). Homeostasis means keeping the internal environment of the body in balance despite changes in the external environment.

Body temperature, blood sugar, hormone levels, pH balance, fluid balance—all of these need to stay within narrow ranges for the body to function properly. The hypophysis, working with the hypothalamus, constantly monitors these systems and makes adjustments to maintain equilibrium.

This biological function mirrors a spiritual truth: when we are connected to our higher self through a balanced crown chakra, we maintain internal harmony regardless of external chaos. We can be in the storm but remain centered and balanced within. We can face challenges without losing our equilibrium.

When the hypophysis is out of balance—producing too much or too little of certain hormones—the entire body goes out of balance. Similarly, when our crown chakra is blocked or our connection to the higher self is disrupted, our entire being—physical, emotional, mental, spiritual—loses its harmony.

The teaching here is clear: if we want to reach balance in our whole life, we need to work with the connection to the higher self through the crown chakra and its physical anchor, the hypophysis.

### Balance and the Inner Ear

There's another crucial connection to understand: the relationship between the hypophysis, balance, and the inner ear. The hypophysis, in its work of creating harmony and homeostasis in the body, is intimately connected with the organs that control physical balance—the vestibular system in the inner ears.

The inner ear contains fluid-filled chambers and tiny crystals that move as we move our heads, sending signals to the brain about our position in space. This allows us to walk straight, to know if we're upside down or right-side up, to maintain our balance as we move through the world.

When this system is disrupted, we experience dizziness, vertigo, the feeling that the world is spinning or that we're falling even when we're standing still. This physical loss of balance is directly connected to the center of the head, to the region of the hypophysis.

The higher self teaches us that when we feel dizzy, when we lose our balance (physically or metaphorically), it is a sign that we have forgotten to be harmonious. We have lost our center. We have disconnected from the balanced state that is our natural condition when we're aligned with the higher self.

This happens not just physically but in all aspects of life. When we feel mentally dizzy—confused, unable to think clearly, spinning in anxious thoughts—it indicates we've lost our connection to the centered, balanced wisdom of the higher self. When we feel emotionally dizzy—swept away by mood swings, reactive, unable to find stable ground—again, we've disconnected from our spiritual center.

The path back to balance is always the same: reconnect with the higher self through the crown chakra. Return to the center. Remember harmony.

### The Sense of Hearing and the Art of Listening

The crown chakra is related to the sense of hearing. This makes sense when we consider that the ears are located at the same level as the hypophysis, and the inner ear mechanism is so closely tied to balance and the functioning of this region of the head.

But there's a deeper teaching here about hearing versus listening. Hearing is passive—sound waves hit your eardrums and your brain processes them into recognizable sounds. Listening is active—it requires presence, attention, intention, and understanding.

The higher self points to one of the biggest problems in humanity today: we don't know how to truly listen. We hear, but we don't listen. We wait to hear what we want to hear rather than listening to what is actually being said.

This manifests in multiple ways. In conversation, we're often not truly listening to the other person. We're waiting for our turn to speak, formulating our response while they're still talking, or trying to hear in their words confirmation of what we already believe. We want to hear our own ideas reflected back to us, not to truly receive what the other person is sharing.

We speak louder to cover other people's words because we don't want to hear what they have to say. We want to impose our ideas rather than receiving theirs. This is a sign of disconnection from the higher self. When a person doesn't listen to others, it shows that they're not listening to themselves—to their inner wisdom, to the quiet voice of the higher self.

True listening is a spiritual practice. It requires emptiness—setting aside our preconceptions, our need to be right, our defensive reactions. It requires presence—being fully here, now, with this person or this teaching or this moment. It requires humility—acknowledging that we don't already know everything, that others have wisdom to share, that the universe is constantly speaking if we have ears to hear.

### Music, Words, and Divine Communication

Hearing is the tool we have to understand music, speech, words. These are vehicles of information, emotion, connection, and wisdom. When we truly listen to music, we receive its energy and its message on multiple levels—not just the words of a song but the emotion in the voice, the story in the melody, the wisdom in the harmony.

When we truly listen to words—whether in conversation, in teaching, in prayer, or in meditation—we receive not just the surface meaning but the deeper truth, the energetic transmission, the love or wisdom or healing that comes through the vehicle of language.

The higher self communicates with us primarily through the subtle senses—intuition, inner knowing, the quiet voice within. To hear this communication, we must develop the capacity to listen at levels deeper than ordinary hearing. We must quiet the noise of the ego, the chattering of the conditioned mind, the constant stream of anxious or compulsive thoughts, and listen to the stillness beneath.

This is why meditation often involves listening—to the breath, to a mantra, to silence itself. We're training the capacity to listen not with our physical ears but with our whole being, to receive communication from the higher self that doesn't come in words but in knowingness, in felt sense, in the resonance of truth.

### The Path of the Spirit

The statement for today's practice is "I Am the Path of the Spirit." This is a profound recognition that our body, particularly our head and the crown chakra, is literally the path through which spirit enters and expresses in the physical world.

We are not just physical beings trying to connect with a distant spirit. We are spirit that has created a physical pathway—this body, this nervous system, these glands—through which to experience and create in material reality. The hypophysis and the crown chakra are the primary gateway of this pathway.

When we say "I Am the Path of the Spirit," we're acknowledging our role as the meeting point of heaven and earth, of consciousness and matter, of the eternal and the temporal. We're not searching for a path to spirit; we are the path. Spirit flows through us, is anchored in us, manifests as us.

This understanding shifts everything. We stop seeking outside ourselves for connection to the divine. We recognize that the divine connection is already here, already established, already functioning—in this very moment, in this body, through this crown chakra and this remarkable tiny gland at the center of the head.

Our work is not to create the connection but to clear the channel, to balance the system, to listen deeply to the communication that is always flowing from higher consciousness into physical manifestation through us.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight, allowing the crown of your head to reach gently upward as if a string is pulling it toward the sky. Close your eyes and take several deep breaths.

Bring your awareness to the center of your head, in a direct line between your ears. Visualize a tiny, glowing pearl at this exact center point. This is your hypophysis, the physical anchor of your crown chakra, the meeting point of your higher self with your body.

Set the intention to balance your entire system through connection with your higher self, and to develop the capacity for deep, true listening.

### Main Practice: Connecting with the Higher Self Through the Crown

**Step 1:** Place your fingertips lightly over your ears and take a moment to appreciate the gift of hearing. Thank your ears for all they allow you to experience—music, voices of loved ones, sounds of nature, words of wisdom.

**Step 2:** Now move beyond gratitude for ordinary hearing and set the intention to develop spiritual listening—the capacity to hear the subtle communication of the higher self, to receive wisdom that doesn't come through physical sound.

**Step 3:** Bring your awareness to the tiny point in the center of your head, the hypophysis. Visualize this point beginning to glow with violet-white light. See this light expanding slightly with each breath until it fills the entire center of your head with soft, radiant luminosity.

**Step 4:** From this center point, visualize a pillar of light extending upward through the top of your head, reaching infinitely into the sky, into the cosmos, into the realm of pure consciousness and spirit. This is the connection between your hypophysis and your higher self.

**Step 5:** Feel or imagine the energy of your higher self—your soul, your divine essence, the eternal consciousness that you truly are—beginning to flow down this pillar of light, entering your body through the crown of your head, and anchoring in the hypophysis at the center of your brain.

**Step 6:** As this spiritual energy anchors in the hypophysis, see it radiating out to all the other glands in your body—the pineal, thyroid, thymus, pancreas, adrenals, and gonads. The hypophysis is communicating with all of them, bringing them into harmony, restoring homeostasis, creating balance throughout your entire system.

**Step 7:** Now bring awareness to your inner ears, to the vestibular system that maintains your physical balance. Feel the connection between this balance mechanism and the central point of the hypophysis. Affirm: "As I am balanced in my connection to the higher self, I am balanced in all aspects of my being."

**Step 8:** Notice if you feel any dizziness, any sense of being ungrounded or spinning. If so, breathe into the center of your head, strengthening the light of the hypophysis, reinforcing your connection to the higher self. Feel yourself becoming centered, grounded, stable—even while maintaining the upward reach to spirit.

**Step 9:** Now practice spiritual listening. Quiet your mind completely. Let go of thoughts, expectations, questions. Simply be present in the silence, receptive and open. Listen with your whole being for any communication from your higher self. This might come as a word, an image, a feeling, a knowing, or simply as a sense of presence and peace.

**Step 10:** Don't strain or try to force something to happen. Just listen. If nothing seems to come, that's fine—the practice of listening itself is valuable. You're training your capacity to receive, to be empty, to be a clear channel for spirit.

**Step 11:** Repeat the vibration "Sa" (pronounced like "sah") three times, letting it resonate in the center of your head, in the region of the hypophysis. Feel how this sound activates and harmonizes this area, strengthening the connection between your physical body and your higher self.

**Step 12:** Speak the statement aloud or silently with deep understanding: "I Am the Path of the Spirit." Feel the truth of this. You are not seeking the path; you are the path. Spirit flows through you in this very moment. Your body, your head, your crown chakra, your hypophysis—all of this is the pathway that spirit has created to manifest in physical reality.

**Step 13:** Visualize your entire being—physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual—coming into perfect balance and harmony, orchestrated by the hypophysis under the guidance of the higher self. Every system, every gland, every cell receiving exactly what it needs, responding in perfect coordination, creating the homeostasis that is your natural state when you're aligned with spirit.

**Step 14:** Take a few moments to rest in this state of balanced connection. You are the meeting point of heaven and earth, anchoring infinite consciousness in finite form, perfectly balanced in the center, listening deeply to the wisdom that flows from above.

**Step 15:** Gently bring your awareness back to your breath and your physical surroundings. Move your head gently from side to side, feeling the balance in your inner ear, the centering in your skull, the connection that extends upward from the crown.

### Closing

Place your hands together at your heart in a gesture of prayer or gratitude. Bow your head slightly, honoring the connection between your physical form and your higher self, between your body and spirit.

Take time to journal about your experience. Did you receive any communication from your higher self during the listening portion of the practice? How does your body feel after working with the hypophysis and balance? Do you feel more centered, more harmonized?

Throughout the day, practice deep listening—both to others and to your own inner guidance. When someone speaks to you, truly listen. Don't prepare your response; just receive what they're sharing. Notice how this practice of listening creates deeper connection and often reveals wisdom you would have missed if you were only hearing without truly listening.

When you feel dizzy, scattered, or off-balance at any point, pause and take a moment to reconnect with the center point in your head, to reestablish your connection with the higher self, and to restore the harmony that is your natural state.

## Integration

Throughout the day, maintain awareness of the center point in your head. When you feel scattered, stressed, or off-balance, bring attention back to this center and visualize the light of the hypophysis glowing there, connected upward to your higher self.

Practice conscious listening in every conversation. Before the other person even finishes speaking, notice if you're already formulating your response. If so, gently bring yourself back to simply listening, receiving, being present with what they're sharing. You'll be amazed at how this simple practice transforms your relationships and how much more you learn when you're truly listening.

Set aside time for spiritual listening—periods of meditation or quiet contemplation where you're not asking for anything, not trying to achieve anything, just opening yourself to receive any communication from your higher self. This might be in the morning before your day begins, or in the evening before sleep. Make it a regular practice.

Pay attention to moments of dizziness or loss of balance, whether physical, emotional, or mental. Instead of just trying to push through or ignore these moments, recognize them as signals that you've lost your center and need to reconnect with your higher self. Use them as reminders to pause, breathe into the center of your head, and restore harmony.

When you listen to music, practice deep listening—don't have it on as background noise. Choose a piece of music and give it your full attention, listening not just with your ears but with your whole being. Notice how it affects your energy, your emotions, your state of consciousness. Music is a powerful tool for connecting with the higher self when we listen consciously.

## Q&A

**Q: What if I can't feel or visualize the hypophysis? Is the practice still effective?**

**A:** Yes, absolutely. You don't need to feel or visualize it perfectly for the practice to work. Your intention and attention are what matter. When you bring awareness to the center of your head with the intention of connecting with your higher self, that connection is strengthened regardless of whether you can clearly feel or visualize the gland. Over time, with practice, your sensitivity may increase, but even without that, the energetic work is happening.

**Q: I often feel dizzy or off-balance. Does this mean I'm disconnected from my higher self?**

**A:** Physical dizziness can have medical causes (inner ear problems, blood pressure issues, medication side effects, etc.), so it's important to rule those out with a doctor. However, there can also be an energetic component. Chronic dizziness sometimes indicates being ungrounded, having too much energy in the upper chakras and not enough in the lower ones, or difficulty integrating spiritual energy into the body. Working with both grounding practices (connecting to the earth through the root chakra and feet) and balancing practices (connecting to the higher self through the crown) can help. The key is to be balanced in both directions—grounded below and open above.

**Q: How can I tell the difference between my own thoughts and communication from my higher self?**

**A:** This is a question almost everyone asks when beginning to develop spiritual listening. Generally, the higher self communicates with a quality of peace, clarity, love, and wisdom. It doesn't use harsh, critical, fear-based language. The ego mind tends to be loud, anxious, demanding, and often critical. The higher self is quiet, gentle, and clear. It feels like truth resonating in your whole being, not just an idea in your head. With practice, you'll become better at discerning the difference. When in doubt, check: Does this message increase love, peace, and clarity, or does it create fear, confusion, and separation?

**Q: Why is the pituitary gland considered disrespectful to call it that, and why does the name matter?**

**A:** The name matters because names carry energy and intention. "Pituitary" comes from a Latin word for mucus/phlegm because ancient anatomists mistakenly thought this gland produced nasal mucus. Calling the master gland of the body—the physical anchor point of your higher self—by a name that means "mucus gland" carries an energy of disrespect or misunderstanding. "Hypophysis," which means "growth beneath" or "attachment below," is more respectful and accurate. That said, the gland itself doesn't care what you call it. Using the name "hypophysis" is suggested as a way of honoring the sacred function of this gland, but if you're more comfortable with "pituitary," that's fine too.

**Q: I try to listen but my mind is always chattering. How can I quiet it enough to hear my higher self?**

**A:** This is the universal challenge of meditation and spiritual listening. The mind chatters; that's what it does. You don't have to completely stop the chatter to hear the higher self. Instead, practice not engaging with the chatter. Let the thoughts arise and pass like clouds in the sky while you remain as the sky itself—spacious, quiet, observant. Focus on something concrete like your breath or a point of light in the center of your head. When you notice you've been caught in thought, gently return to your focus without judgment. With consistent practice, the spaces between thoughts grow longer, and in those spaces, you can hear the subtle voice of the higher self. Also, sometimes the higher self communicates not in the silence but through the thoughts—you'll recognize these communications by their quality of wisdom, peace, and resonant truth.

**Q: Can working with the hypophysis/crown chakra help with hormone imbalances?**

**A:** Energy work can support physical healing but should never replace medical treatment for hormone imbalances. That said, since the hypophysis is the master gland that regulates all other endocrine glands, energetic work with the crown chakra and visualization/meditation focused on the hypophysis can support the body's natural balancing processes. Many people report improvements in hormone-related issues when they combine appropriate medical treatment with energy work, stress reduction, meditation, and lifestyle changes. Always work with qualified healthcare providers for medical issues while also supporting your body through spiritual and energetic practices.

**Q: What if I feel more connected through my heart than through my head? Does that mean the crown isn't my primary access point to spirit?**

**A:** Different people naturally access spiritual connection through different centers. Many people find the heart chakra more accessible than the crown, especially those who are feeling-oriented or who have overactive mental activity that makes the head feel cluttered. This is perfectly fine. The heart is a powerful spiritual center. However, balanced spiritual development eventually involves opening and working with all the chakras, including the crown. Even if the heart feels like your primary access point, it's valuable to develop the crown connection as well. Think of it as having multiple doorways to spirit—you can enter through whichever one is most open, but over time, you can open all the doors.

**Q: How does this teaching relate to the concept of "awakening the third eye" which is often emphasized in spirituality?**

**A:** The third eye (pineal gland, sixth chakra) and the crown (hypophysis, seventh chakra) are related but different. Both are important spiritual centers. The third eye is about perception, intuition, and insight—seeing beyond the physical. The crown is about connection to the higher self and pure consciousness. Many spiritual teachings emphasize the third eye because it's often more accessible and more obviously "active" (visions, insights, etc.). However, the crown is equally important and is actually the primary connection point to your higher self. Ideally, both are developed and work together: the third eye perceives spiritual truth, and the crown maintains the connection to the source of that truth. In this teaching, we're working with all the chakras in turn, honoring each for its unique function.

*May you walk in perfect balance, centered in the connection between your human form and your divine essence. May you listen deeply to the wisdom of your higher self and share that wisdom through your words and presence. I Am the Path of the Spirit.*
