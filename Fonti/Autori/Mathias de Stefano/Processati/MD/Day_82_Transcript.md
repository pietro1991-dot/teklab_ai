# Day 82 - Real and Illusion

## Overview

Matías warns: "This got the least comments ever. Most people didn't get it. I had to read it twice myself." This teaching is profoundly reality-shattering.

Core premise: Reality is not real. It's an illusion. Everything you think is "real" is atoms organized differently, interpreted by your brain as ideas. The only thing that exists is mind. Everything else—including you, physical world, every object—is mind playing, creating illusions through atom arrangements.

Consciousness is not the same as mind. Mind = everything, great concept of all. Consciousness = tiny ability to be aware of that mind's logic. Rocks have mind. Trees have mind. Everything has mind. But only certain beings (whales, dogs, cats, humans, monkeys, octopus) have consciousness—ability to recognize themselves as separate. Only some (humans, some whales/dolphins) have intelligence—abstract thinking ability.

Today explores: why "reality" doesn't exist, how consensus creates "things" illusion, the drunk universe trying to open a door, what "you create your reality" really means. This will hurt your brain. That's good. It means it's working.

## Core Teaching

### The Word "Real" Comes from "Thing"

We use "real" to mean "true." But why use "real" when there's no absolute truth?

Real comes from Latin res = thing. Res is origin of republic (res publica = things of the people). We call res (thing) all we can touch, count, feel through five senses. A "thing" is something we measure through senses.

But senses are only energetic pulses helping receive information. Brain processes information. To understand what's outside, you create an idea. The idea helps recognize external objects—not the other way around.

So: what you think is "real" (res, thing) is basically an idea of it—but not real.

### Reality Is Illusion

Everything we have around—things we touch, feel through senses—only exist because: (1) Pulses (energetic signals) created an idea, (2) The idea allows "reality" to exist, (3) But reality doesn't exist by itself.

"I think, therefore I am." Reality is not real. It's an illusion, a mirage.

You protest: "But I'm touching this! I know it's real!" Response: "Maybe you think it's real, but it's not—just perception of vibrations creating energy making atoms join."

Everything that exists = atoms organized differently. That's it. Nothing else. Nothing exists besides atoms. Everything besides atoms is a sensitive, sensorial illusion.

To exist, to acknowledge "what I am," you need mind to make it appear, to make it be.

### Mind vs. Consciousness vs. Intelligence

Mind is everything. Great concept of all that exists. Mind allows atoms to be and organize differently. Everything has mind: rocks, trees, animals, weather, mountains, fire.

Consciousness (being conscious) is just ability to be aware of mind's logic. Consciousness is something tiny inside mind. Certain beings have consciousness: whales, dogs, cats, humans, monkeys, octopus. Why? Because they can interpret themselves as separate being, acknowledge themselves as self.

Intelligence is possessed by: humans, some whales, dolphins. Intelligence = ability to think abstractly, create complex systems, communicate symbolically.

### Illusion = Mind Playing

Illusion comes from Latin luz (light, to play). Luz is origin of: lúdico (playful), ludopathy (gambling addiction), illusion (mind's game).

Illusion = mind playing. Simple. Mind plays a game creating perceptions, creating "things" that seem real but are only organized atoms interpreted through ideas.

### How Consensus Creates Reality

If reality doesn't exist and everything is illusion (mind playing), how can we build a new world? If everyone perceives reality through their own perceptions, thinking differently?

Answer: Reality is consensus of a group of people. Three people agree something is real. They all perceive it the same, so "that something is what they perceive, so that is real."

"This is water." We all know this is water. But this is not water. This is hydrogen and oxygen interacting. And they're not even "hydrogen" and "oxygen"—they're quanta, something different.

But this is "water" for us because we decided it's water.

### The Drunk Universe Metaphor

Why need three persons to think something true? Because three points in space create point of reference recognizing three-dimensional aspect. Three points give you high, depth, weight—three points of view acknowledging object in three-dimensional world.

Three-dimensional world creates objects. When you have three points of view (width, depth, height), you create goal, which is objective. Objective becomes object because you can watch, point at it from these three bases.

When you have object in front, you acknowledge reality. This is why universe needs Trinity to acknowledge existence: body, soul, spirit. Vibration, energy, matter. Trinity concept acknowledges reality.

Universe is a drunk guy. Best way to understand how this works. Universe is biggest drunk person you could know. When you're drunk, you see object multiplied, all around—different perceptions. This is multi-dimensional beings.

Multi-dimensional is like being drunk. You see all dimensions of one thing in different perceptions from different points of view simultaneously. Really crazy. Can't focus on one thing.

Universe image: drunk person with many points of view. Drunk guy has gone through whole night drinking, big hangover. Everything looks weird. But drunk guy needs to open door. Has key, must put key in lock. But watches everything moving around. Impossible to open door.

What does universe do? Creates as many eyes as possible to focus on one tiny spot in lock. All eyes watch this spot so it could open door. Thousands and billions of eyes watching different perspectives of key. All can tell drunk guy with hangover how to open door to go home to origin.

This explains how we all are different eyes of this big drunk guy (universe) trying to open door to go home. We're all trying to tell him: no, like this, no, turn key that way, no, do it like this. So he could open door and we could all go home again.

## Practice: Third Eye Activation

**Preparation:**
- Comfortable position (lying, sitting, standing)
- Legs straight, uncrossed
- Stretch body, relax, focus on breathing

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation (left foot → head → right foot)

**Third Eye Focus:**

19. Perceive I Am presence above head as light
20. Light descends through crown to third eye (middle of brain)
21. Take both hands, fingertips (heart finger and pointing finger)
22. Bring hands to sides of head by sides of eyes
23. Massage in circles all around space between ears and eyes (both sides)
24. Move fingers over eyebrows toward third eye (joint of forehead and nose)
25. Massage like "opening third eye physically" from top of nose, pressing all over eyebrows

**Vibration Integration:**

26. Relax hands by sides
27. Allow yourself perceive sensations at sides of head and forehead
28. Express vibration SSka through breath/mouth
29. State: "I am conscious evolution" (repeat)
30. Raise, stretch own way
31. Bring consciousness through all joints where I Am can anchor
32. Softly return here now, open eyes

**Closing:** Remember to drink water. Every like helps spread information without ads.

## Key Insights

1. Real (res) means "thing"—what senses can measure, but senses are just energetic pulses
2. Everything is atoms organized differently; everything besides atoms is sensorial illusion
3. Mind is everything; consciousness is tiny ability to be aware of mind's logic
4. Rocks, trees, weather all have mind; only some beings have consciousness
5. Consciousness = recognizing self as separate; intelligence = abstract thinking ability
6. Illusion comes from "play"—mind playing game creating perceptions
7. Reality doesn't exist by itself; it's ideas allowing appearance of existence
8. Consensus creates reality—group agreeing on perception makes it "real"
9. Trinity needed to acknowledge existence (three points create dimensional reference)
10. Universe is drunk guy trying to open door; we're all different eyes helping him see
11. Multi-dimensional perception is like being drunk—seeing all perspectives simultaneously
12. We're not separate observers; we're universe's eyes trying to help it go home
13. Physical world is sustained by quantum mechanics, which has no logic
14. Illusion (quantum field) creates reality (physical world)
15. "You create your reality" means your perception (idea) makes "things" appear real

## Integration

**Daily:** Notice moments when you treat perceptions as absolute "things." Remember: you're creating ideas about atom arrangements, not touching objective reality.

**Weekly:** Practice third eye massage, opening perception. Recognize how your brain constructs "reality" from energetic pulses.

**Monthly:** Observe one area where your group has consensus reality. What would happen if you questioned that shared perception?

**Ongoing:** When overwhelmed by "real" world problems, remember: you're one eye of drunk universe trying to help it open door home. Your perspective is essential but not complete without others.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If everything is illusion, why does it matter what I do?**
A: Illusion doesn't mean meaningless. It means mind is primary. Your experiences are how mind recognizes what it created. The experiences are real to consciousness even if atoms aren't "things."

**Q: What's difference between mind, consciousness, and intelligence?**
A: Mind = everything (all atoms organizing). Consciousness = aware of being separate self. Intelligence = abstract thinking, complex communication. Rocks have mind; dogs have consciousness; humans have intelligence.

**Q: Why need three people for consensus?**
A: Three points create three-dimensional reference (height, width, depth). Three perspectives acknowledge object in 3D world. Trinity creates reality.

**Q: Is drunk universe metaphor serious?**
A: Yes. Multi-dimensional perception (seeing all angles simultaneously while unfocused) perfectly parallels drunkenness. Universe is trying to focus infinite perspectives on one spot to "open door home."

**Q: If reality is consensus, can we change it?**
A: Yes, but requires changing group agreement. When consensus shifts (three or more perspectives align differently), "reality" transforms.

**Q: Why does quantum mechanics have no logic?**
A: Microcosmos level doesn't follow macrocosmos physics laws. Quantum field (illogical, potential) creates physical world (logical, manifest). Illusion sustains reality.

**Q: Are we really eyes of drunk universe?**
A: Metaphorically yes. Each consciousness is unique perspective of one mind observing itself, trying to coordinate infinite viewpoints to perceive clearly and "get home."

**Q: What does "getting home" mean?**
A: Returning to unified perception, recognizing all perspectives as one mind. Opening door from fragmented observations to integrated understanding.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching is challenging because it dissolves our foundation. We want reality to be solid, dependable, "real." But ancient wisdom and modern physics agree: atoms organized differently, interpreted through ideas, held together by group consensus.

You are not separate observer of objective reality. You are one of infinite eyes drunk universe uses to try seeing clearly enough to open door home. Your perspective matters because universe needs all viewpoints to coordinate, to focus, to finally turn the key.

When you say "this is water," you participate in consensus creating "thing" from hydrogen and oxygen. When you feel third eye opening, you experience mind becoming aware of its own logic. Reality is illusion. Illusion is mind playing. And you are mind playing at being you, creating consensus with other players, all trying to help drunk universe navigate home.

This is conscious evolution.
