## Introduction

I had so many settings that I have no idea what I was touching so I 'm like an old guy so that 's what I need to do now to see what I was touching.

So now , okay , I just choose another thing.

Sorry , no glasses. And it missed the video.

So today let 's begin with the throw chara related to the physical weak in the constellation of Gico.

Remember that the throw chara is the one related to the expression.

So it 's related with education with the process of learning related with the physical aspect of this chara. We can relate it with the process of apprehension.

So remember that it 's apprehension with an age because apprehension means to learn is another word for learning that comes from Latin and that means this movement that you do to go outside to catch something and bring it to you.

So let 's remember that the throw chara is related with the communication.

So also is related with the law of vibration.

So everything that violates in the outside is connected to the vibration within.

So when I speak , when I communicate , I also receive the answers back.

So I am learning by the environment.

So this is the process of learning and to educate to express and that everything that I express and that I learn is coming to me and through me because it violates and rebounds with me.

So everything that is around me , everything that rebounds with me is because I am related to everything through vibration. Everything is connected with vibration. This means that what you have in when we say a word , when we express something , we emit a vibration that moves the waves of vibration around me and like a sonar in a boat , it will rebound all the vibration and come back to me as an echo.

So remember that the law of the vibration would be to rebound , which is I sound , I create a sound and that sound goes into the outside and then comes back to me again as an echo.

So that 's what we call re sound , okay , when the sound comes back to me again.

So when I understand the resounding concept , I can also understand that everything that comes to me is because it is vibrating in the same level as I am by vibration.

So this is why everything that I need or the express for myself , all of those , all of that is going to come to me again.

So basically this is what we used to call the law of attraction that I express something that I need.

So that thing that rebounds with what I need is going to come back to me again.

So I need is going to come to me.

So picture this that this law has nothing , no relation with what I believe is related with what I violate.

So we usually have to think that attraction comes from vibration.

So we may know a lot of people that even if they think in a good way , they do n't violate in a good way. For example , people that think that we have to be good people , that we have to act properly , but then in the other hand , they gossip and criticize others constantly.

So there is a lot of people that they believe how you are supposed to be , but they live their lives very differently from what they believe. And this is what we would say to think is not the same as violate.

So this is why the law of attraction works only about how I violate in my life and not how I think in my life. What we have to understand now is that due to this vibration , one of the things that we usually do is for example , that the vibration that I have within is going to be expressed in order to look for something in the outside.

So for example , if I am vibrating low or in negative , I will try to express myself to go outside to look for something positive for a positive energy.

So in the other hand , we also being positive , for example , we are going to go outside to look for something negative , which in this meaning in this sense , to look for something negative , being positive would be to look for a challenge to transcend yourself to go into another level.

So for example , easy example , I am in positive because I am like with a lot of energy.

So I am looking for something negative , something that I do n't have , that I do n't know , that could help me to go into another level of consciousness , for example , to learn another language. Maybe you say , I want to learn something new that I do n't have and that thing is a negative.

So you make your challenge to go into another process by something that you do n't know how to handle.

So in this way , positive or negative , they are looking stuff in the outside.

So this happens not only as a human , but also in the atomic realm.

So everything is looking for positive and negative , trying to reach new things.

So the reason why we as positive or negative usually look for the opposite outside is because what we are trying to do is to evolve , to find the harmony through evolution.

So what we are trying to do is to take more things , new things that helps us to be more in balance and also to transcend ourselves in order to go in another level of awareness.

So as I said , this happens not only in the atomic realm , but also as humans in our daily life.

So in order to do this process , to realize that you vibrating some symphony and that you have to go outside to look for something , we have this words to say it to express it. This means that you from the inside has to express and go outside towards the outside. And why do you move outside because you have something prior , something behind that tells you I need something in advance.

So this that you are looking for in advance going outside is something that you need that you have to grab to catch.

So you can have it.

So in Latin , we would say to go outside , add for something previous , which you may say prior , and to catch that new thing , which in Latin you may say , endure.

So , ah presence is the origin of the word ah presence , which also comes from the Taxon word , yornian , that means to catch to grab , which is the name of English learn. What this means that the physical body will try to go outside to catch new things that are useful for it to go into another level of awareness to evolve.

So to to apprehend means that the body , the physical body is willing to look for something that it needs.

So it make it by it it made those those things as their own.

So the body says this is mine now , this is part of myself.

So now I will use it to go into another stage of my evolution because it holds us within.

So to apprehend is to catch something that was outside and made it make it as your own within. The process of apprehension is something that we all do in the first seven years of our lives. When we are trying to adapt to the environment , so we take all these things that the environment gives us in order to allow ourselves to move and to expand and transcend in that space. This means that in the first years of our lives , what we do is to accept from the external many of the things that we naturalized and normalize through our lives.

But that they were not ours like the language we speak , the actions we take , the attitudes that we use , the attributes that maybe we imitate from others in our family or environment , the culture that we are thinking. What we apprehend is the ability to accept as our own many of the things that helps us be where we are.

So when we go to school , the process of apprehension becomes the process of learning. What does it means to learn? To learn means to acquire something by constant repetition and by imitation , the mimic of it , but memorizing this concept. At the process of learning , usually , holds also the concept of , I will forget everything that I study for the test.

The difference , for example , between apprehend and learn is , for example , that in the process of learning , we would say America was colonialized in 1492 , for example. But that 's just information. It 's not my own. It 's not , I did n't apprehend that.

It 's not useful for my life. But it 's something that I just memorize to know it. Is it cold? Nothing knows.

Colonized. Colonized. Colonized. To apprehend is to take stuff that will be useful for my daily life inside of me.

And to learn is to take data information that I will maybe use someday , but it 's just information.

So one of the things that we have to realize is that the most of the apprehension process is done by the physical body , not by demand.

So we would say that the mind learned , but the body apprehend.

So this is the differences. To learn is by the mind and to apprehend is body.

## Guided Meditation

So this means that in order to apprehend something new , to do something different , I have to take action to do it with my body , to act in my life. This is why the great changes of our lives can not be done just by doing meditation. Meditation would help us to order the physical , to think about the physical , to think about the issues , but then we have to take action. We have to do stuff.

We have to work physically to acquire that information really within.

So this is the main thing that we have to learn about today or that we have to acquire today , acknowledge , which is that in order to apprehend , we need to act to do , to move ourselves. This is why in order to learn how to do it again , we have to go back before we started to go to school.

So at the first seven years of our life. Let 's repeat this. This is why in our , in the spiritual path that we all , that we all are taking , the spiritual path usually are very mind that they , the path is very in the mind with the process of learn , which is good , which is good because you have the information. But once you have the information , you have to make the action , you have to take action to do it.

So we started with , in this month , we started by just taking notes.

Okay. That 's the first action that we have to do in order to calm the mind. We will have a lot of monk ahead where we will have to take action.

So remember that we still have Capricorn to work , areas to make the exercise and torus to , for the eating process.

So we need to do physical , a lot of work to put in practice.

So this is why we needed , in order to do that , we needed to understand what , learn and apprehend mean.

So we could start to make the process of acknowledging , okay , that the physical is the one that apprehend.

## Q&A

So the task for today is to write down about what are the first learning , the first processes of apprehension that you had in your life.

So we are going to start this by writing down what was the first word that we ever said in our lives. What we have to do first , so it 's write down the first word that we ever said. And then all the things that you could remember that you have learned in your first seven years of life , not after the seven years before. What have you learned from your mom , from your dad , from whoever was around you.

So for example , something easy , like the first time you learn how to write a bike , I do n't know , something like that. At the Nercuillón , para no carlos.

So for example , maybe through a heat , we understood how to walk properly and not to fall again. It does n't matter if it 's a good thing or bad thing. The important thing is that you could remember something that you have learned before you were seven years old.

So do n't make any question , just whatever , whatever.

Remember , must be stuff that you have learned and that you keep inside even today. Things that you still today , you can do without thinking in your daily life.

So we could all remember something because all the things like , for example , talking , we have learned that when we were less than seven years. For example , everyone maybe would remember when you were trying to do your homework or to write it down , A , B , C , and who was there? Was your mom , was your dad , was someone else , teacher , whoever.

So never say no , I ca n't , I do n't remember now. Never , just open your mind and just let it go. Maybe you can not know now , but maybe tomorrow or in the month , you will start to remember.

So never say no , just open your mind and allow information to come.

So also , if you can not remember anything and you are trying to very hard in different days , so maybe you have to ask yourself , why I ca n't remember. When I recognize that I am trying to block the memories from my childhood , maybe I can ask why , why , why , why , constantly. Because maybe your mind is trying to block something heavy. Like , I do n't know , a rape violence.

I do n't know , stuff like that , bad stuff that you hated , but you learned also from those things. You have learned a lot of things from those bad things.

So you also have to write it down , to acknowledge it.

So I hope you could understand why it 's so important , the physical body in all this process , because all of the physical body is the one able to apprehend. The information , get imprinted in our cells , in our body , in our NA.

So the vibration of today is say.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the statement for today is , I am the greed of vibrations. The code for today is the soul pattern , V. It says , the only thing we take when we die , it 's the inheritance of what we have lived , learned , experienced. Every being in a legacy itself , and memory is the only great success that we earned at the end of every life.

V is the sound of what we have accomplished in life , the luggage we receive. And we deliver the concept of the soul 's home , of the soul 's home.

So let 's go to that.

So we begin by stretching the body , messaging the body , and warning. No. No. Take a deep breath and relax your body.

## Guided Meditation

Breathing and breathe out by the nose. I become aware of the oxygen coming inside my body through the nose , towards the lungs , heart , blood , organs , and muscles. Take a deep breath and go within your body. Acknowledge in every one of the cells of your body until you see one that calls your attention.

Go with it until you see it big as your own body in front of you. Take a deep breath and go inside the cell and start to float inside the seat of the pleasant. Grabbing the chromosomes and disarm in it until you feel the strips of NA carrying around your fingers. And then fill in the codes and information that makes you be who you are.

## Energy Work

I observe a above and recognize that I am inside an egg and a loss , a mother cell. And even more above , I perceive the light of the eye am coming towards me as a spiral with the shape of a spermatoid heading to my crown. As I perceive the eye am the spermatoid touching the egg , I feel how it changes the magnetism of the egg , making it shine in every direction as a sun. Take a deep breath and perceive the eye am coming inside the crown , the third eye , the throat , the heart , plexus.

And from there , feel how all its genetic material starts to spread towards the scrum , the root , knees and feet. As I feel the potential of the eye am , I feel how my cell starts to divide into , doing meiosis , cellular metastasis. I recognize the cell from my point of view , the eye and the one in front of me , the arm , both being I am. Take a deep breath and be aware of these two cells divided in form , age , sixteen and so on towards all the directions.

And with my vibration , I start to expand each one of the organs that are being created. I begin to pronounce the sound very soft.

So , I continue to pronounce , in the meantime to observe , I keep pronouncing it as I feel the body , my body , start to create itself. I feel myself being created as this cell expands with my sound. My heart is being formed , lungs , the brain. Stove , lung , liver , bankaths , each one of the glands , each one of the tissues , muscles and bones.

I perceive how my body starts to be informed within my mother. I perceive my feet and legs , my back , arms and hands , and also my hand. I start to move ahead. Ah , I take deep breath.

I push towards the outside , outside of one , feeling the light in the crown. I feel all my head going out. I feel the crown eyes , ears , nose , mouth , and now all my neck outside. I feel the light in clarity.

I now allow myself to set free my sound. Ah , I recognize. I am agreed of vibration. I am agreed of vibration.

I am agreed of vibration. I am agreed of vibration. I start to bring this consciousness through all my body , cares , stretching and warning. I come back here and now open my eyes.

I am agreed of vibration. I am agreed of vibration. And of course , drink a lot of water and rest a lot. Bye.
