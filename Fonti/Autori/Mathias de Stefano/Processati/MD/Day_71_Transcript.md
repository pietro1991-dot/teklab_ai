## Overview

Today we begin the **Emotional Week of Libra**, continuing the month of balance with our focus on the **Crown chakra**. After completing the Mind Week (Days 61-70), where we explored ten pairs of balanced opposites through mental understanding, we now move into experiencing these teachings through our emotional body.

The topic for this opening day is **Doubt and Certainty**—two concepts our society views as opposites, but which we'll learn to balance as complementary forces.

In our current civilization, we're heavily oriented toward certainty. We seek concrete answers, specific truths, proven facts. This began around the late 15th and early 16th centuries with the scientific method, which brought us the idea of having "the truth" about something—something you can prove, something you can experiment with.

But here's the paradox we'll explore today:

**Science was born from doubt**, from questioning everything. Religion was born from philosophy, from asking "Why?" Yet society transformed both into sources of certainty, creating the very opposite of their origins.

**The body needs certainty to feel safe. The soul needs doubt to grow.**

Understanding this balance is essential for our spiritual development. We're not here to eliminate doubt or to chase absolute certainty—we're here to recognize that both are necessary tools in the journey of learning and evolution.

## Core Teaching

### The Paradox of Science and Certainty

Let's begin by understanding a crucial historical shift that affects how we relate to doubt and certainty today.

**Science was NOT created for certainty. Science was created to explain things, to try to figure out things that religion had declared certain.**

Science starts by investigating through doubt. **The basis of science is doubting everything.** The answer is never final—you can always figure out something new.

But here's what happened:

**The society around science has designed the belief that science has "the answer."**

Do you see the shift? **Science is based on doubt, but the society born from science believes that science is certainty.**

### The Paradox of Religion and Faith

The same transformation happened with religion.

**Religion was born from philosophy.** Philosophy was the ability to make questions, to question the universe: "Why is this? Why should it be like this? Why is the universe like that?"

**The basement of religion is to question.**

But when religion became social, became political, the questions transformed into answers. Religion created certainty from questions—what we call **faith**.

### Who Made the Mistake?

So both religion and science began with **doubt**, with questioning, with investigation.

Then society made both doubt and religion and science into **certainty**.

**Who is mistaken? Is it science? Is it religion?**

It's very clear: **It's all of us.**

And why is this? Why society? Why us? Why are people the problem?

The answer takes us to biology.

### The Biology of Certainty

**Certainty gives us security. It helps us be safe.**

Knowing that the sun will rise again every morning is something certain, and something that makes us feel secure. We know the sun will rise every day, so we feel quiet, reassured: "Oh, okay, it will happen."

**It's about survival.**

This is why when society—when governments, politicians, the economy, religion, or whoever is trying to control us—the first thing they do is to create an enemy or create something that scares us.

Once they do that, the rest is easy.

This happens because **we are fragile. Our bodies are fragile in reality.**

We're so fragile that anything, for so little, can scare us. Anything can kill us. We're so easy to kill that the body says: **"I have to survive. I need security."**

**This is why the body, to feel secure, needs certainty.**

So whatever happens around us that makes us feel a little bit secure will become for us an absolute certainty.

Nobody feels fine when you don't have anything to relate to. When you have no idea what your purpose is, what you're doing, who you are—all those things that are unclear, that you don't know what's going to happen—make you feel terrible.

This is normal for all of us.

### The Problem with Doubt

**This is why doubt is kind of the worst thing that could happen to us.**

This is why naturally in our lives we say, "I want change!"

But when change comes and brings doubt and insecurity, we say: "Why me? Why is this happening to me? Why these doubts?"

**We have to acknowledge that certainties are not for the mind, not for the soul. Certainties are just for the body. Certainties are just the tool that biology needs to feel safe.**

### Science and Religion: The Same Beginning

When we go to the very beginning of both science and religion, **both of them have the same beginning: a question.**

This question will bring another question, and another one, and another one.

**And it doesn't matter how far you go—you will always find another question.**

### Certainty as an Anchor

Picture this:

**Certainty is like an anchor** that I need to realize I have achieved, to recognize that I've arrived at that place.

But then **I have to keep going.**

**Whoever attaches to a certainty never moves forward. They stay still.**

A certainty becomes a belief. A certainty becomes a comfort zone.

So uncertainties are good things, but just to recognize that I have assimilated an answer. Once I have that answer, I cannot just stay with that answer. I have to keep trying to understand.

### The Network of Truth

Here comes the question: What do I do? If doubt keeps taking me, making me feel like "I don't know what to do," and certainty keeps me stuck in one spot—how do I put them together?

**The image we may use is this:**

**Each doubt is like a grid in a network of different paths, different streams.**

The joints of these lines and streams—the **nodes**—are certainties.

Each certainty is a node where the information is the truth.

The **paths** are the questions that bring you to that truth.

But if I just close myself into just one certainty, I will miss many of the others.

**So what I have to do is change my idea of doubt from insecurity to something that is helping me seek new answers—curiosity, trying to learn more.**

**Doubt is the thing that helps you be open to learn much more things.**

An answer that is concrete and very certain will limit your capacity to open to learn different aspects of that truth.

### Transforming Doubt and Certainty

One of the things we have to do to change this is to **transform the idea that we have of doubt and uncertainty in our life.**

**First:** Recognize that **doubt doesn't bring us insecurity. It brings us the possibility to open ourselves to see different possibilities.**

**Second:** **Certainty is not a universal truth. Certainty is the assimilation, the process of learning, of integrating the answer of an experience.**

It's not an absolute truth—it's just the answer of an experience.

### Life Between Doubt and Certainty

**Our life must be constantly living between certainty and doubt.**

Basically, **without doubt, I cannot move forward, I cannot learn.**

And **without certainty, I won't have any idea that I already learned.**

**The problem is thinking that the goal of our life is to have certainty. That's not the goal of life. The goal of life is to learn.**

And in order to learn, I need doubt.

### Certainty: The Placebo of Ignorance

Today my higher self wrote that **certainty is the placebo of ignorance.**

The reason why it's the placebo of ignorance is because the people who don't make more questions, who don't go beyond, are basically the people who are attached to one certainty and say: "I don't want to know anything else. This is good for me."

**This is why the goal of life is not certainty.**

This is why I usually try not to give absolute answers in my explanations. I try to open questions, to create curiosity, to inspire doubt that leads to learning.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch your body. Yawn. Cross your limbs. Massage yourself.

Let the weight of your body fall down. Release all tension.

Focus on your breathing. Feel the air coming inside your whole body.

### Becoming Wind

Focus only on your breathing and how your entire body becomes wind.

Feel the air outside your body. Perceive the wind around you connecting with the wind within yourself.

### The Divine Soul

Perceive, feel, or imagine the colors and shapes of your soul.

Become aware of this divine being that creates your body and flows through it, flowing love everywhere.

Recognize that in this soul you can find all your emotions, everything that you feel.

### Illuminating the Crown

Take a deep breath, inspiring the energy of your soul.

Put your hands facing the sky at the height of your heart.

Recognize that in the next days, you will be doing everything possible to balance all those aspects that are of the soul throughout your soul.

Perceive the light of the sun, the fire, coming to your head and lighting your crown with a beautiful violet.

### Integration: Doubt in One Hand, Certainty in the Other

Perceive how this light in your head divides into two rays that go through your body.

See two rays that go towards your hands.

**In one hand, feel doubt.**  
**In the other hand, find certainty.**

Recognize all the doubts that you have had in your life.

Acknowledge that even now you are having some doubts, and also acknowledge that **you will always have doubts until the moment you die.**

Recognize that **doubts are a part of you, but they are not something that limits you. They are something that helps you know yourself better.**

### Recognizing Certainties

Recognize that in the other hand, you have lived your life through certainties.

Also acknowledge that **some of those certainties are the ones that are keeping you back, not allowing you to move forward.**

Become aware that certainties are the roots of your beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and actions.

Set the intention to make these two tools something useful for you in your life.

### Understanding the Balance

Recognize that **doubts can make you feel lost in your life, and your certainties can stop your process of evolution.**

But you must also acknowledge that **your doubts are the ones that help you evolve, and your certainties are the ones that tell you what you have been.**

**Your doubts are the questions. Your certainties are the answers.**

### Unification

Bring your hands to your heart, unifying these two concepts by expressing the vibration:

**SSka... SSka... SSka... SSka...**

**"I Am the Spiritual Flux."**

**"I Am the Spiritual Flux."**

I am the flow of questions and answers, forever moving, forever learning.

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Softly start to bring this awareness through the body by caressing, stretching, and yawning.

**"I Am the Spiritual Flux."**  
**"I Am the Spiritual Flux."**  
**"I Am the Spiritual Flux."**  

When ready, gently open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Mapping Your Certainties and Doubts

Today, create a simple map of your current certainties and doubts:

**Certainties I hold:**
- What do I believe is absolutely true about myself?
- What do I believe is absolutely true about life?
- What am I completely certain about?

**Doubts I carry:**
- What questions am I afraid to ask?
- What makes me feel uncertain or insecure?
- Where do I resist questioning my beliefs?

Look at this map and ask: **Which certainties have become comfort zones limiting my growth? Which doubts are actually invitations to learn?**

### Transforming Your Relationship with Doubt

This week, practice seeing doubt differently:

**When doubt arises, instead of thinking:**
"I'm insecure, I'm lost, I don't know what to do"

**Try thinking:**
"This is an invitation to learn something new. This doubt is opening possibilities I haven't seen yet."

**Doubt is not your enemy. Doubt is your teacher asking you to expand.**

### Using Certainty as Anchors, Not Prisons

Review your certainties:

**Healthy certainty (anchor):** "I have learned this. I have integrated this answer. Now I can use it as a foundation to explore further."

**Unhealthy certainty (prison):** "This is the only truth. I don't need to learn anything else. Anyone who questions this is wrong."

Notice when your certainties become rigid beliefs that stop your evolution.

### The Learning Spiral

Recognize the natural spiral of growth:

1. **Doubt arises** (I don't know, I question)
2. **I investigate, explore, experience**
3. **Certainty emerges** (I've learned, I've integrated)
4. **New doubt arises** (deeper question, new layer)
5. **The spiral continues**

This is not failure—this is the path of learning. Each layer of certainty becomes the foundation for new questions.

## Q&A

### Q: If doubt is good for learning, why does it feel so uncomfortable and scary?

**Because your body is designed for survival, and survival requires predictability.** Doubt means the unknown, and the unknown could contain danger. This is biology, not spirituality. Your soul thrives on doubt and exploration, but your body prefers the safety of certainty. The discomfort you feel is the body's alarm system saying "Alert! Unknown territory!" Learn to distinguish between healthy caution and limiting fear.

### Q: How do I know when I've stayed too long in a certainty and need to move forward?

**When the certainty becomes a belief system that you defend instead of examine.** When you resist questions about it. When you feel threatened by alternative perspectives. When you notice yourself saying "I already know that" and closing your mind. When you're more attached to being right than to learning more. These are signs your certainty has become a comfort zone limiting your growth.

### Q: Isn't some certainty necessary? Like being certain about love, about spirituality, about fundamental truths?

**Yes, but understand what certainty really is: an integrated answer from experience, not an absolute universal truth.** You can be certain that "love is real" because you've experienced it—that's a valid certainty from your experience. But stay open to learning more about what love is, how it manifests, how it evolves. Even profound truths have layers. Your certainty is your current understanding, not the final word.

### Q: How can I balance doubt and certainty when society demands I choose sides—believe this or that, science or faith?

**By recognizing that the demand to choose sides is the trap.** True wisdom holds both: the questioning spirit of science AND the experiential knowing of faith. You can be scientifically curious while being spiritually certain of what you've experienced. You can have faith while still questioning and exploring. The balance is internal, not about external allegiance to one camp or another.

### Q: What if my doubts shake the foundations of everything I believed? Isn't that dangerous?

**That's not dangerous—that's spiritual growth.** Every major evolution in consciousness requires some foundations to shake. The question is: are those foundations based on your authentic experience, or on what you were taught to believe? Real foundations (built from genuine experience) will remain and deepen. False foundations (built from conditioning, fear, or borrowed beliefs) will crumble. Let them. What's real will survive the questioning and emerge stronger.

### Q: If the goal is to learn, not to have certainty, does that mean I'll never have solid ground to stand on?

**No. It means your solid ground is the PROCESS of learning, not a fixed destination.** You have certainty (anchors) at each stage that give you stability—but you don't mistake those anchors for the final truth. You stand firmly on what you've learned while remaining open to learning more. The solid ground is your capacity to integrate experience and keep evolving, not a static set of unchanging beliefs.

### Q: How do I live with important doubts—like doubting my life path, my relationships, my purpose?

**By honoring the doubt as a question seeking deeper understanding.** Doubting your life path doesn't mean you're on the wrong path—it might mean you're ready for a deeper layer of that path. Doubting a relationship might be asking "Is this authentic? Is this growing?" Those are good questions. Don't rush to certainty to escape the discomfort. Live the questions. The answers emerge through living, not through forcing certainty.

### Q: You said certainty is the placebo of ignorance. But isn't spiritual teaching full of certainties—"love is all," "you are divine," etc.?

**Those are invitations to experience, not commands to believe.** True spiritual teaching says "Explore this. Experience this. See if it's true for you." When it becomes dogma—"You must believe this or you're wrong"—it's become the placebo of ignorance. The statement "You are divine" is meant to inspire your exploration and experience of divinity, not to become a belief you defend without understanding.

## Closing Reflection

Today we've explored one of the fundamental balances necessary for growth: **Doubt and Certainty.**

We've seen how both science and religion were born from questioning, from doubt, from the desire to understand—yet society transformed both into sources of certainty, into systems of fixed beliefs.

**This transformation happened because our bodies need certainty to feel safe.**

But **our souls need doubt to grow.**

The path forward is not to eliminate one in favor of the other, but to understand their proper roles:

**Certainty is an anchor**, a moment of integration, a recognition that "I have learned this." It provides stability and grounding.

**Doubt is the current**, the movement, the exploration that carries us forward. It provides growth and evolution.

**Life is the dance between them.**

When you feel doubt arising, instead of seeing it as weakness or confusion, recognize it as **an invitation from your soul to expand, to learn, to discover something new.**

When you feel certainty settling, instead of clinging to it as the final truth, recognize it as **a resting point, an anchor, a foundation from which to explore further.**

**The goal of life is not to arrive at certainty. The goal of life is to learn.**

And learning requires the constant interplay of questions and answers, doubt and certainty, exploration and integration.

**"I Am the Spiritual Flux"**—the eternal flow of questioning and answering, doubting and knowing, seeking and finding, forever moving in the sacred dance of growth.

See you tomorrow for Day 72, as we continue the Emotional Week.

Rest well. Drink water. Integrate this teaching.
