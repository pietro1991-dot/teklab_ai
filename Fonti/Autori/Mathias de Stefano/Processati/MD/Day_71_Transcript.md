## Introduction

Hi , good morning , good evening , good night.

So today we start with the emotional week of Libre.

So , hope you can hear me , you can watch me. Well , in those comments we will start with the live audio.

So I see everyone joining.

So let 's talk about the topic that the pyramid gave today , which is doubt and certainty.

So let 's start by trying to understand these two different concepts that from the point of view of ourselves today is , from our point of view is duality , they are different concepts , but in the energy of Libre we need to calibrated them to balance them.

So our societies today are very related to certainty as of living , because what we usually try to do is to find the concrete. The concrete , the specifics that we call to have certainty and something.

So these probably started around late 15th century or the beginning of the 16th century when the scientific method started.

So this means that the science brought to our civilization the idea of having the truth of something to be certain about something , something that you can prove that you can experiment.

So this kind of spread in our Western societies as a way of living. The thing is that in that time when the perception of reality was through science , science would say that if those things that are not certain , that does n't have a precise answer , they would be stuff related to faith.

So when we say , I do n't know , God knows or who knows , only God knows , those doubt concepts are related to the concept of doubt and faith.

So this is why in our civilization we put the idea of doubt to the things that we can not see. This was not something done by the science , it 's something done by a society based on scientific ideas.

So this society based on the scientific ideas created the concept of of of some tea on realities like this must be like this. And they divided it into the imaginary faith of spirituality like this is something we can doubt about.

So we would say that this is this should be the opposite , but what really is happening is that the society is the one that created the idea of the certainty of the scientific experiment. But it would be the opposite that really.

So what I wanted to say , like this , is that in the origin science was not created for the certainty , science created to explain the things to try to figure out the things that religion had for certain things.

So science starts to investigate through doubt , the basis of science is doubt done everything. The answer is never correct , you always can figure something new. But the society around science has designed the creation , sorry , they believe it has designed the believe that science has the answer.

So this is why the science is based on doubt , but the society that was born from science believed that science is the certainty. Do you know , do you realize about what I 'm saying? I hope you do.

## Q&A

So in the other hand , we have religion and religion was born from philosophy. Philosophy was the ability to make questions to question the universe. Why this is , why should be like this , why the universe is like that , so on.

So it 's based on the question.

So the basement of religion is to question. But suddenly when the religion became social , became politics. The religion created the questions into answers and they created the idea of certainty that we call faith.

So science and religion has gone through the same process.

So speaking with this , if both religion and science has begun by doubt and then society made it doubt and religion and science into certainty both of them.

So who is the one mistaken? Is science is religion? Who is it? It 's very clear.

It 's all of us. And why is this? Why society? Why us?

Why the people is the problem?

So now we go to the answer through that issue that maybe bothers you , which is biology.

So the reason why is biology again is because certainty gives us security. It helps us be safe. Because for example , knowing that the sun will rise again every morning is something certain and something that makes us be secure. Because we know that the sun will rise every day , so we feel like quiet because , oh , okay , it will happen.

So it 's about survival. This is why when society , when the guns , politicians , economy , religion , or whoever is trying to control us , the first thing that they do is to create an enemy or to create something that scares us. Once that they do that , the rest is easy.

So this happens because we are finned , our bodies , finned , reality. We have spoken about this.

So we have so finned that think and kill us. Anything. We are so easily , we are so easy to kill that anything for so little that it could be that can scare us. The body says , I have to survive on security.

So this is why the body to feel secure needs certainty.

So this is why whatever happens around that makes us a little bit secure will be , will be , will be came for us an absolute certainty.

So picture yourself. Nobody feels fine when you do n't have anything to relate to. When you have no idea what is your purpose , what are you doing , who you are , all the things that are unscrupulous , that you do n't know what is going to happen makes you feel like terrible.

So this is normal for all of us. And this is why doubt is kind of the worst thing that could happen to us.

So this is why naturally in our lives we usually want change and we say , I want to change. Only when change comes brings also doubts and security. And you say , why me , why it 's happening to this to me , why so doubts.

So this is why we have to acknowledge that the certainty are not for the mind , not for the soul , certainty are just for the body. Certainty are just the tool that biology needs to feel safe.

So basically when we go to the very beginning of science and the very beginning of religion , both of them will have the same beginning , which is a question.

So this is , this question will bring to another question and to another one and another one. And does n't matter how far you go , you will always find another question.

So let 's picture this. The certainty is like an anchor that I need to realize that I have achieved to arrive to that place. But then I have to keep going. Whoever attaches to a certainty never move forward.

Stay still. A certainty becomes a belief. A certainty becomes a comfort zone.

So , uncertainties are good things , but just for this to recognize that I have assimilated an answer. But once I have that answer , I can not just stay with that answer. I have to keep trying to understand. I have to keep.

Here comes the thought of what do I do? If doubt keep taking me like , like , I do n't know what to do. And the certainty keeps me. Get me straight in one spot.

So how do I put them together?

So the image that we may use for this is that each one of the doubts is like a grid in a network of different paths , different streams. And the joints of lines and streams , the joints of them , the nodes are certainty.

So each certainty node where the information is the truth. And then the path are the questions that brings you to that truth. But if I just close myself into just one certainty , I will miss many of the others.

So what I have to do is to change my idea of doubt from insecurity to something that is helping me to seek for new answers , curiosity , trying to learn more. Doubt is the thing that helps you to be open to learn much more things. Answer that is concrete and very certain will limit your capacity to open to learn different aspects of that truth.

So the first thing that we have to do in order to change this is to transform the idea that we have of doubt and uncertainty in our life.

So one of the things that we have to do to change the concept of doubt , for example , is to recognize that doubt does n't bring us insecurity. It brings us the possibility to open ourselves to see different possibilities. And the second certainty is not a very truth. Certainly is the assimilation , the process of learning , of integrating the answer of an experience.

So it 's not an absolute truth , it 's just the answer of an experience.

So now pay attention , our life must be constantly living in between the certainty and the doubt. Basically , because without doubt , I can not move forward , I can not learn. And without certainty , I wo n't have any idea that I already learned that the problem is to think that the goal of our life is to have certainty. That 's not the goal of life , the goal of life is to learn.

And in order to learn , I need doubt.

So today I wrote my higher self wrote that certainty is the placebo of ignorance.

So the reason why is the placebo of ignorance is because the people that does n't make more questions that does n't go beyond is basically the people that is taught to one certainty and say , I do n't want to know anything else , this is good for me. This is why the goal of life is not certainty.

So this is why also , beyond I usually explain , I try not to give absolute answers.

So I think that 's all.

So the vibration of today is fa.

## Daily Practice Elements

So we change the initial letter , fa , the letter fa means the flux to flow. It means river. The statement for today is I am the spiritual flux.

So the code for today is the physical pattern , ca. And it says , with consciousness recognizes that matter is just a secret. It 's just a secret as the heaven for it 's not under the sky , but floats in it for the heaven , the material goes through it and constitutes it for all matter , for all matter is energy and all energy is vibration and this all is divine. And now knows that every object is an objective of itself.

For the divine lays within realities united by a unique purpose. The K , K , sound is that objective. It 's the goal of finding the divine in the joy of the mundane. It 's the comfortable start to stretch the body.

Yeah. I let the weight of my body fall down. I 'm just only in my breathing. I perceive the air coming inside my body.

I feel how it moves through it. I start to feel how the air moves like wind within my energy of my body. I feel the movement of all the colors , the warm energy , the cold energy all around and through my body. I pay attention to it.

I perceive , feel or imagine , the colors and shapes of my soul. I become aware of this divine being that creates my body and the most through it , love everywhere. I recognize that in this soul can find all my emotions , everything that I feel. I take a deep breath , inspiring the energy of my soul and I put my hands facing the sky at the height of my heart.

## Energy Work

I recognize that in the next days I will be doing everything as possible to balance all those that are the soul throughout my soul. I perceive the light of the sun , the fire , coming to my head and lighting my crown with a beautiful violet. I perceive how this light in my head divides in two rays that goes through my body. I see two rays that go towards my hands and one of them I feed out and the other one I find certainty.

I recognize all the doubts that I had in my life. I acknowledge that even now I am having some doubts and also I acknowledge that I will always have doubts until the moment I die. I recognize that doubts are a part of me but they are not something that limits me. They are something that helped me know myself better.

I recognize in the other hand that I have lived my life throughout uncertainties and also acknowledge that some of those uncertainties are the ones that are keeping me back , not allowing me to move forward. I become aware that uncertainties are encroach of my beliefs , thoughts , feelings and actions.

## Q&A

So I set the intention to make these two tools , but something useful for me in my life. I recognize that doubts can make me feel lost in my life and my uncertainties can stop my process of evolution. But I also must acknowledge that my doubts are the ones that help me evolve and my uncertainties are the ones that tells me what have I been. My doubts are the questions , my uncertainties are the answers.

I bring my hands to my heart , unifying these two concepts by expressing the vibration. I am the spiritual flux. I am the spiritual flux. I take a deep breath and softly I start to bring this awareness through the body by crossing , stretching and dummy.

I am the spiritual flux. I am the spiritual flux. I am the spiritual flux. I am the spiritual flux.

Thank you for being there. I am the spiritual flux.
