## Introduction

Good morning! Good afternoon! Good evening!

Today our topic is. . . My pleasure!

With this I just want to tell you that My pleasure is not an illness My pleasure is a condition of human nature My condition of adaptability to the environment The use of all emotions Num toy My feelingsumb toy My pleasure is not an illness I long history humans discovered the way to adapt , to link to the others to evolve to survive. We are another one who is really useful to survive.

So , religion is a different way to find many other personalities in another levels in the imagination. Eliminating everything that we really are , the ability of being another one helps us to be who we really are today. To find creativity , different ways in which we can find imagination , new ideas of what can we become. Culture , religion.

It may as be what we are until the moment has come for everything to change. Being crazy is a key to move forward. To change the place where we are in order to find a new one. We started to create civilizations , cities , morality , and we have to survive through saddenterism and to be one in order to survive together.

Which made us look for being one and to be another one was wrong. This is how the idea of being another one has become something wrong , negative. When reality was the key to be who we really are. To be free from who we are , to change ourselves to be another one is a key for the transcendence of ego.

In Latin , to change the place , it is say crazy mad. If we want to change who we are , we have to let behind the idea of who we believe we are. The only thing that can separate and identify someone that is crazy from someone that is connected is from its ability. To handle emotions.

We are going to know how to know our emotions. This is why it is so important for us to recognize each one of our own emotions. To be connected with our emotions , to let them free so we could know what are we capable of. Those who are crazy are connected people that does n't know how to handle their inner , connection.

To be crazy is to be able to see different points of view that helps us to evolve to see beyond and my polarity is the ability to see two different ways of the same thing.

So acknowledging that we are by polar beings by nature , we have to encourage ourselves to find a way not to handle and hold by polarity but to know how to guide it into purpose.

So can we breath as we take the breath we recognize that within us coexist everyone of our personalities. Each emotion , each feeling is a way for us to connect with the everything. To be able to be everything and nothing. To recognize myself.

To know everyone that I can become. To recognize that there are no sick people that there is only. People that is trying to know themselves in different ways. This is the way how the moment of our death we can become to everything.

I take into breath. I recognize that within me I am many , many more from those that I believe I am. I perceive myself in the center of a circle and around me I can see each one of my personalities as a character. I perceive myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me.

I observe my personality in front of me according to who I have in front of me. I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me. I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me. I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me.

I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me. I hold an arm , every part of me. I integrate all of them in me. All the ones that I am in me , the everything in one.

I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me. I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me. I am emotional energy. I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me.

I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me. I observe myself in the middle of a play in the theater where every character is part of me. I take a deep breath. I take my hands to my chest.

Thank you for being part of this madness.
