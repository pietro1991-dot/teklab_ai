## Introduction

Okay.

So now I. . . More , yeah.

Hi , everyone. How are you? Good morning. Good afternoon.

Good evening.

So I begin today by saying hi in Atlanta language , because. . . .

. . We. .

. . . .

We. . . .

. . We have received the message in that language.

So. . . .

. .

So this is why. . . .

. . I guess we needed to begin like that.

So just for you to say hi in the Atlanta. . . .

. . And that language from this region , say Sana , . .

. Which is the contraction of another word , which is Sana and head and Na. That means. .

. . . .

Made their use lips through you and protect you and express. . . .

. . And expressing you and so on.

So the contraction is Sana and it 's kind of like saying hi. Hello. It is S-A-N-A-H-S-N-A.

So I hope you have your listening to me. . . .

. . That we have a good connection. .

.

So first of all , the person that taught to us yesterday was not taught. It was a master. It was another one.

So it 's like a school and taught is like the director of the school. And this one was a master at the teacher in the school.

Okay?

So the image , so you could understand the image of this person. It is like if for example , I am a teacher.

Okay? And I am in a classroom. Do you in a class? Give in a class in school as a teacher.

And there comes the master , okay? The professor. The master of the school that supervised the teacher and the class.

## Q&A

So he entered the classroom to ask , how are you doing? What are you doing? What have you learned until now?

So it was kind of like this. It was kind of like supervising. What have we done and what we are doing? The dialect that he spoke , the language that he spoke.

It was an Atlantic dialect used in the north of the Nile in the Atlantic times.

So one of the things that he said as he began at the very beginning , he said , he said , a lot like a mess then. A lot like a mess then. The first law of the unit is the mentality , the mind. And you can do whatever you want with it.

You can imagine where you want your free.

So feel free to do whatever you want with your mind , with your imagination. But you have to acknowledge that you can be trapped in the infer of your own mind.

So coherence is the way in which you find the path within eternity.

So you do n't get lost and you can work perfectly.

So that was his advice and his advice was very precise to all of us. In this very moment.

So to try to explain what he said , what he tried to say is that we must remember that the first law of the universe is mentality.

So mentality is talking about the mind , that the universe is only mind. And that the mind is so wide that there 's no limitations on the mind. Nobody can take you , what you think , nobody can take you , what you have inside.

So this is the only freedom that you have , your own thoughts , your own imagination is your only freedom.

So that 's why you can do whatever you want to do with your freedom. To whatever. It 's free , but it 's so much , so much that we can be free in that eternity that we can get lost in that eternity. This is why the universe limit itself in patterns.

The patterns help the infinity to find a way apart.

Okay , so what he said is coherence is the way in which you can put order in those patterns. The patterns by that can help you to move forward in the infinite of you. That would be the advice he gave. And then another thing.

And here 's when we have to be very serious and to be a lot of attention.

So let 's have this image. Let 's have this image of schools that I used before.

So you picture this , you are there , like the students. The students , you have the teacher here , given a class. And then you have the supervisors that come sometimes to see how you 're doing , teach something they leave. And then you have the directors that they do n't usually come.

They only come for big events or important moments.

So he said , we are like part of one school. And this is the school with all the students that are listening to you.

So everyone listening and feeling and resounding with you , they are part of our school.

So we are like kind of the supervisors and directors and masters of this school that you have here. But there are many schools around the world. We have schools in India with the gurus. We have other schools of charity in Europe.

We have other schools in North America within Diff , Americans , the schools of the Andes.

So many schools. And each school has its own masters , it 's own teachers. And they are teaching in a different their own knowledge.

So he said that soon , next year and also , in between next year and 2022 , all the schools are getting premier for kind of an exam or a job that everyone must do together.

So each one is prepared itself in its own areas to do their part. And this is a team work on education.

So each one of the schools are like universities.

So each one has its own area of expertise.

So some of them are engineers. The other school or universities for architecture , the other ones are doctors. The other ones are philosophers. Each school has its own expertise.

But we all somehow , in a moment , we have to work all together. But to work together is not that everyone has to be in the same place. To work together is to acknowledge that each one of the other schools are doing what they are supposed to do. And each one of these schools work like a wheel , like in this , in a clock.

And what he said was , we have to work hard because in this mission that we all share , there is no school that should n't be a lamp. Everyone must do its work.

So there is no possibility to fail because if one fail , the whole clock stops.

So he said , you 've not been months to finish your studies. After the studies comes practice. And after the brass , the exam.

So what we are doing here are basically two things. The main one and the most important one is that we are working for ourselves for who we are.

So it does n't matter what it 's going to happen in nine months. It does n't matter what it 's going to happen in 2022. It does n't matter where it 's going to happen any moment.

Okay , that 's not matter. Because what we are doing here is working in ourselves. Nothing else matters. But the second one is that they say , okay , if you are working in yourself , so you will realize that you are part of a bigger thing.

So when you become coherent , whatever you do , starts to affect the rest.

So this is why we know that we can work with you. In the whole thing , in the whole environment , not only in the self.

So we start to be in service.

So one thing to say about this , what we are doing here , okay , is to work with ourselves. But now one , no one , sorry , no one , that is listening to this. No one that is doing everything this , everything that we are doing here , every alignment , everything. No one is obligated to be on service because service is not by obligation.

Nobody can tell you what to do to do on service. Nobody , because service only comes from the heart. We are here to work in ourselves. And if within you , you awake , the coherence and the potential of saying , I want to be in service for the rest.

So we will do the job when the time comes. But no one here , no one here watching this must feel obligated to be pushed to do something if they do n't feel it. If you do n't feel it , okay , that is the main thing to know.

So you do n't feel the pressure of doing something that you do n't feel , okay? Nobody can tell you to be in service. That 's only something that comes from your heart , from your own self , when the time comes.

So this is something that I am saying , that I am saying to you , not them. They are saying , we have come here with our responsibility.

So yes , of course , we have a responsibility , but responsibility is not equal to obligation to do something.

Okay , so you are not obligated to do anything. This is service through responsibility.

So by saying this , let 's go to speak about anger.

So just to let you know , all this that we in and the nine months coming ahead. This is all time to prepare to study.

Okay , what we are doing now is to study.

So this is what we are doing now. But then we have next year August September of October of November , December and January , 2022. This six months will be for practice. I have no idea what is the practice.

So do n't worry about it now. Just let 's go into study.

So this topic that we are going to discuss today is deep , but easy , I guess.

So let 's go to the point.

So anger , anger , we relate this emotion as if it is against law. It 's like the lower violent energy from the low of our body that press and pushes to the war to fight to range.

Okay.

So by culture , of course , we have said that anger is something wrong and something negative that we have to get rid of. But as always , and with every concept , when we are going to do today , is to talk about the positive aspect of anger.

So first of all , let 's try to understand what anger means. Anger comes from the word , anger in the European languages , that it means to be repressed , trapped , compressed in one spot.

## Energy Work

So in Latin , we have another root for this word , which is Ira , that comes from Ace , Ace means a very fast movement. That 's what it means.

Something very violent and very quick , fast.

So these two concepts are very important to understand the rage , the anger of which we are going to speak.

We are going to speak about.

So this energy , the energy of the vital energy that is created in our body , is all created in our genitals. And from the genitals , it comes up going to the head. But all this energy that comes from below is based on the need , is based on the desires.

So all the energy that is created there is created by the impulse , is impulsive energy , that is to get stuff that is willing to do to take action. And this energy is so impulsive that most of the people that are talking about spirituality perceive or have perceived this energy as something that is wrong , as something that it does n't allow you connect with the spirit , because it 's all related to the ego , all related to the desire , the needs , and we have to get rid of that or control that.

So this is why for thousands of years , the virtual people and the mind people , what they did was to try to control this energy , to control all these impulses , because they said this is not good , because this is from the ego , it 's not spiritual.

So we have to control it. What they did was to put all that impulse in a cage , because this impulse is so errant , you , you erratic , you have no idea what is going to happen.

So that 's why we call it error , okay? And because it 's this is erratic , so an error , what we do is to control it , because this is the problem of all our conflicts , the origin of all our problems. That 's why they call it the guilty one , and the guilty one is in the Latin language , they call it son , which is sin in English , okay?

So the sinners , okay , have this energy of the impulse.

So what the people did in that time was to create by morality , by morality , by my religion , they created a division of the body , call it this the pure , above from the heart , and from theplex to the impure.

So what we have to do is to get rid of all the impure that we have in our body , all the desires , all the needs , and we call that the main sins of our society , so we go into the spirit.

So the problem that we have here is that all the pressure of energy that goes up to connect with the spirit is created in the genitals.

So what happened with this energy is that these people , by culture , by religion , by laws , they got trapped this energy here , so it does n't go up , and they do everything as possible to make it disappear , to put , to turn off the fire.

So the energy of the genitals can not move , but against all expectations , this fire never , never ends. It is continually creating itself.

So this means that the energy of the genitals starts to be more and more and more , so as much I try to set off the fire , the fire will try to go up.

So we are not allowing this fire to move softly up , and we feel this fire going like explosions , like , oh , oh , exploding everywhere without purpose.

So the same energy that we create in our body , and that is pushing , imposing us to go towards the spirit is the same energy that we interpret , rage and anger. The explosion of all this vital , vital energy that is trying to create , that 's what creates chaos , destruction , thing and the same energy that is destined to create is the same energy that ends up destroying. What we have here now is that the reason why this energy creates this is by importance. What is importance to be important , basically comes from the word important , which to have the will to can to be able to have the power.

So this is importance means not to have power , which is the negative in not to have power.

So if I press this energy and I am not allowing it to move to set all its energy for what it was created , what it was created for , which is to transform to create to manifest.

So I take away the power of my own energy , and if I take away the power I feel important , I can not do anything. And so all this energy that was created to manifest , try to find a way out , and that 's why we call anger and rage.

So the last movement without any control.

So what we have to learn today is that we are not here to get rid of anger and rage. We are not here to set ourselves free from those emotions.

So the way in which you empower yourself is by being fully aware of your own body , of your own emotion and your own mind.

So the first step would be to love your body to take care of the body. What you do of your own needs , your highest , your , to take care of your body , what you eat , to take care of the tree of life , which is your family tree , all the conflicts that have received from your family or all the diseases , the conflict that you have in your body , to learn to love your body and respect your body. Second one would be the soul , the emotion.

So to recognize what are my emotions , which are them , what are my own emotions , what are the emotions that I inherited from the other ones , what are the , what are the emotions that I am expressing inside of me , what are the emotions that control my life.

## Guided Meditation

So the mind would be thoughts , the leaves , what are my beliefs , what are my thoughts , what are the good ones , the bad ones , what is my truth , what are my lines , what do I say , what they expressed to others , what I do shut up , what are my trauma. When I go through my body , my soul and my spirit is when I start to understand where I have the lack of power and it 's important to understand to know that you can not say , how can I get my power back or how to , how do I get my power back , and power again , it 's not like a blue or red peel , there 's no placebo for empowerment , there 's no therapy , there 's no meditation , there 's no one that can help you to get your power back. The only way you will get your power back is by acknowledging all the different parts where you had a lack of power.

So you have to make a lot of insight work , you have to understand each part of yourself and this is why we are trying to do here , everyday taking a different information to understand , to watch and to take a side inside of us. We have to make this kind of self analysis of all that we have to understand where we have a lack of. The only way you can get the power back is not by taking it from somewhere outside , is by acknowledging where do you have , where do you have that lack inside. And why do you have that lack of power?

So empowerment is not something that you just activate one day to another , is something you have to practice is constant , it takes a lot of time. This is why this implies a lot of autonomesis , a lot of self observation.

## Q&A

So this is not that in two years one year half when we do this task altogether , that 's it , we did it. No , when we did was a job that we had to do altogether , that 's why we are preparing ourselves. But after that , at the next day , we 'll keep going. We are just getting united to make a job together , but at the other day life keeps going.

And the work inside keeps moving by your own , your own life.

So this is why I invite you to think about what are all the emotions and the energies that you are keeping trapped inside of you. Because of shame , culture , religion , beliefs , because all of that is the energy that you need the now it 's anger or rage.

So to understand that there is no one way of showing rage or anger. It 's not only the people that say , ah , it 's also the people that just look like this to someone like , that 's a right edge. There are people that express their anger hurting the other ones and there are people that they do n't express their anger and they only hurt themselves.

So this is why when you think about anger , the anger you have is because you are feeling implant , important. That you feel that you are not being able to do something , that you do n't have the power to do something to be in action.

So the question would be , who told you that you can not do it? Who told you that you do n't have the power to do something? Or when was the moment that you started to believe that you do n't have the power to do something?

So first go to that moment and that person. And in that moment you say , well , I will do it and you do it.

So as this being said yesterday , I ca n't think and believe anything that I can do , I can do whatever , but only thinking or believing it , it is like imagination. And it 's eternal and I can get lost there. This is why the only way to accomplish that is by doing it. My action.

When I start to act , I take my power back.

So I do n't need rage and anger anymore. The vibration for today is Vo. The goal for today is the 11th dimension. The information records manifested dimension , where all times become information that codificates spaces.

This means the parallel dimension is best. If in the 8th dimension , all the possibilities of every mission can be contemplated in the 11th dimension , they become real and coexist.

So let 's go to the alignment. To begin moving our shoulders and circles to this charge tension. And I take deep breathing , letting all the weight fall down. I just focus in my breathing.

I become aware of the light around shining outside and within my being. And taking a moment to perceive all the people that I know around me. The good ones , the bad ones , according to my point of view. The closest ones in the far , the twins.

All around. Without any distinction , I perceive how my inner light surround each one of those people. And how this brightest light reflect in each one of them. I recognize that all this people is part of my own body of my own eye with the shape of an ocean.

And each one of those people are just a wave in the surface of the water. I take a deep breath and dive with the light. Going through the conscience of the unconscious , receiving the light , and thing , and both. And see you get deeper into the shadows , the darkness of the subconscious.

As I get deeper , I perceive the pressure of this ocean on me. It 's pressure. It 's holding my potential , my power , keeping the energy in the shape of an angel. What are the amateurs that you recognize within the subconscious?

What are the amateurs in your life? I recognize them , and I said the intention. I desire to motivate my rage , my honor , and get back my power. I desire to empower.

And I rebound my desire. I desire to empower. I desire to empower. I desire to empower.

I desire to empower. I am too impatient of goals. I desire to empower. I desire to empower.

I desire to empower. I desire to empower. I desire to empower. I desire to empower.
