## Overview

Day 107 brings an unexpected gift: an Atlantean greeting and teaching about coherence. This is one of the most profound and unusual days in the entire year—Matias channels ancient Atlantean language and concepts that have been dormant for thousands of years.

We work with the crown chakra today—the center of universal consciousness, connection to Source, and the ability to see wholeness beyond individual parts.

The teaching centers on a single Atlantean word: **Sana**. This word, which Matias explains comes from his memory of Atlantean times, is both a greeting and a complete philosophy of consciousness. It means something like:

**"I see you as you are in your coherence with infinity, even as you walk your individual path through time."**

This is supervisor consciousness—the ability to hold awareness of both the individual journey and the infinite wholeness simultaneously, without judgment, without trying to fix or change, simply witnessing with love and understanding.

To help us understand this concept, Matias uses the metaphor of a school supervisor—someone who watches children in a playground, seeing all their struggles and learning processes, but doesn't interfere unless truly necessary. The supervisor sees the bigger picture: these children are learning, growing, becoming. The individual conflicts are part of the process.

---

## Core Teaching

### The Atlantean Word: Sana

Matias begins by explaining that in his memories of Atlantis, there was a greeting that carried a much deeper meaning than our modern "hello" or "hi."

**Sana** (pronounced "SAH-nah") was used when greeting someone, but it didn't just mean "hello." It was a statement of consciousness, an acknowledgment of the other person's wholeness.

The closest translation:

**"I see you in your coherence with infinity."**

Or more fully:

**"I recognize you as a complete being, coherent with the infinite whole, even as you experience your individual path through time and space."**

This greeting was a reminder—both to yourself and to the other person—that despite whatever individual struggles, confusions, or challenges are happening, you are fundamentally coherent with infinity. You are whole. You are part of the infinite. You are on your path.

### Coherence

The key concept here is **coherence**.

In physics, coherence means waves that are in sync, aligned, harmonious—like light in a laser where all photons move in the same direction with the same frequency.

In consciousness, coherence means:
- Alignment between your parts (mind, body, heart, spirit)
- Alignment between your individual self and the infinite whole
- Internal consistency and integrity
- Harmonious relationship with what is

**You are in coherence with infinity** means:

Even when you don't understand it, even when you're struggling, even when you feel lost or broken, you are fundamentally aligned with the infinite intelligence that creates and sustains all things. Your individual path, with all its apparent chaos, is coherent with the whole.

This is a radical perspective. It means there are no mistakes, no wrong turns, no failures. Everything is coherent with infinity—including your struggles, your confusions, your "dark night of the soul" moments.

### The School Metaphor

To help us understand this supervisor consciousness—this ability to see coherence even in apparent chaos—Matias offers a beautiful metaphor:

Imagine you're a supervisor in a school playground. You're watching children play during recess.

From your adult perspective, you can see:
- Two children fighting over a toy → They're learning about boundaries, sharing, conflict resolution
- A child crying alone → They're learning about emotions, solitude, self-regulation
- Children forming groups and excluding others → They're learning about belonging, hierarchy, social dynamics
- A child trying and failing at climbing equipment → They're learning about perseverance, limits, capability

As the supervisor, you don't rush in to fix every conflict or prevent every fall (unless there's real danger). You understand that **the struggles are the learning**. The children need to work through these experiences to grow.

You hold awareness of the bigger picture: These are not problems to be solved. These are lessons being learned. These children are on their paths. They are coherent with their growth process.

From the children's perspective, these experiences are enormous—traumatic, overwhelming, all-consuming. The child fighting over the toy can't see the learning; they only feel the injustice, the anger, the want.

But you, as supervisor, can see both:
- The individual child's experience (real, valid, intense)
- The coherence of that experience with their growth path (part of learning, part of becoming)

**This is the consciousness of Sana: seeing both the individual struggle and the coherence with infinity simultaneously.**

### Supervisor Consciousness

This is crown chakra awareness—the ability to hold the perspective of the whole while honoring the individual.

Most people live only in the individual perspective:
- "This is happening to me"
- "This is wrong"
- "I'm broken"
- "I need to fix this"
- "Why is this happening?"

The supervisor consciousness adds the wholeness perspective:
- "This is happening for my growth"
- "This is coherent with my path"
- "I am whole, even in this struggle"
- "This is part of the learning"
- "This is exactly what needs to happen"

**But here's the key: You don't use the wholeness perspective to bypass the individual perspective.**

The supervisor doesn't tell the crying child, "Stop crying, this is just a learning experience, you're fine." That would be cruel, dismissive, harmful.

The supervisor holds both: validates the child's real pain AND knows it's coherent with their growth.

Same with yourself. You don't tell yourself, "My pain doesn't matter because it's all coherent with infinity." That's bypassing.

You say: "My pain is real, valid, important AND it's coherent with my infinite path. Both are true."

### Sana as Practice

When you greet someone with "Sana," you're practicing this consciousness:

- I see your struggle (individual perspective)
- I see your wholeness (infinite perspective)
- Both are true simultaneously
- I hold this awareness for you
- I don't need to fix you
- I don't judge your path
- I recognize you as coherent with infinity

This is incredibly healing. To be seen this way—not as broken and needing fixing, but as whole and on your path, even in your struggles—is profoundly validating.

And when you see yourself this way—**Sana to myself**—you give yourself the same gift:

"I see myself in my coherence with infinity, even as I struggle through my individual path."

### Why This Teaching Appears in Scorpio Week

This might seem like a strange teaching for Scorpio's emotional week. We've been diving into difficult emotions—resentment, sadness, melancholy, hypocrisy. Why suddenly an Atlantean greeting about coherence?

Because **this is the integration**.

After examining all these challenging emotions, after diving into the shadow, after facing hypocrisy and attachment and pain, you need the supervisor consciousness to make sense of it all.

You need to be able to say:

**"All of these struggles, all of these emotions, all of these shadow aspects—they are coherent with my infinite path. They are not mistakes. They are not failures. They are the curriculum of my growth."**

Sana is the crown chakra's gift after the Scorpio week's deep emotional work: the ability to see it all as coherent with infinity.

### The Atlantean Connection

Matias explains that this greeting comes from his memory of Atlantean times—a civilization that existed thousands of years ago (according to his recall and channeled information).

In Atlantis, language was vibrational. Words carried not just meaning but energetic transmission. **Sana** was a sound that activated the awareness of coherence—both in the speaker and the receiver.

When you say "Sana" to someone, you're not just conveying information. You're transmitting a frequency that helps them remember their coherence with infinity.

This is why we're asked to use it as today's vibration practice. Speaking it, intoning it, feeling it—this activates the crown chakra and attunes us to supervisor consciousness.

### Application to Daily Life

How do you use this teaching practically?

**When witnessing others:**
- See their struggles as part of their path
- Don't rush to fix or change them
- Hold awareness: "They are coherent with infinity, even in this"
- Offer support when asked, but don't take responsibility for their journey
- Trust their process

**When witnessing yourself:**
- See your struggles as part of your path
- Don't judge yourself as broken or wrong
- Hold awareness: "I am coherent with infinity, even in this"
- Seek support when needed, but trust your process
- Honor both the pain and the wholeness

**In relationships:**
- Greet others with the consciousness of Sana (even if you don't say the word)
- "I see you in your wholeness, not as a project to fix"
- This creates space for authentic connection
- People feel safe when they're not being judged or fixed

### The Crown Chakra

The crown chakra is the portal to universal consciousness—the ability to see beyond individual perspective into infinite wholeness.

When the crown is open:
- You can hold multiple perspectives simultaneously
- You see both individual and collective
- You recognize coherence in apparent chaos
- You trust the larger process
- You don't need to control or fix everything

When the crown is closed:
- You're trapped in individual perspective only
- Everything feels random, chaotic, wrong
- You feel separate from the whole
- You need to control and fix
- You can't see the bigger picture

Sana is a key that opens the crown—it's a vibrational reminder of your coherence with infinity.

## Practice

### Sana Activation (Crown Chakra)

This practice activates supervisor consciousness through the Atlantean vibration of Sana.

**Preparation:**
- Sit comfortably
- Place hand on crown of head or slightly above
- Breathe deeply
- Set intention: "I open to coherence with infinity"

**The Practice:**

1. **Attune to the vibration** (5 minutes)
   - Begin to tone the word "Sana" (SAH-nah)
   - Let it be slow, resonant, vibrational
   - Feel where it vibrates in your body (crown, throat, heart)
   - Continue toning: "Sana... Sana... Sana..."
   - Let the sound activate your crown chakra
   - Don't worry about doing it "right"—the intention matters

2. **Apply Sana to yourself** (7 minutes)
   - Think of a current struggle in your life
   - Feel the individual perspective: the pain, confusion, difficulty
   - Don't bypass this—feel it fully
   - Then say to yourself: "Sana—I see myself in coherence with infinity"
   - Hold both: the struggle is real AND it's coherent with your path
   - Breathe into this dual awareness
   - Repeat: "Sana" as you hold both perspectives

3. **Apply Sana to another** (7 minutes)
   - Think of someone you love who's struggling
   - Feel your desire to help, fix, save them
   - Notice the contraction in trying to control their path
   - Then say: "Sana—I see you in coherence with infinity"
   - Release the need to fix
   - Trust their process
   - Hold both: their pain is real AND they're coherent with their path
   - Repeat: "Sana" as you hold both perspectives

4. **Supervisor perspective** (7 minutes)
   - Imagine yourself as the school supervisor
   - See yourself and all humans as children in a playground
   - Everyone is struggling, learning, growing
   - From this perspective, nothing is wrong
   - All experiences are coherent with growth
   - You don't need to intervene in every struggle
   - You hold loving awareness of the whole
   - Rest in this supervisor consciousness

5. **Integrate the teaching** (6 minutes)
   - Return to normal awareness
   - But bring the supervisor consciousness with you
   - You can now toggle between perspectives:
     - Individual (my pain, my struggle, my experience)
     - Supervisor (I am coherent with infinity)
   - Practice moving between them
   - Both are true
   - Both are valid
   - Both are needed

6. **Closing** (3 minutes)
   - Say "Sana" one final time
   - To yourself
   - To all beings
   - Feel the recognition of coherence
   - Open eyes when ready

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Sana Greetings:**

This week, practice greeting people (silently or aloud) with the consciousness of Sana:

- When you see someone struggling, silently say: "Sana—I see you in coherence with infinity"
- When you notice yourself struggling, say: "Sana—I see myself in coherence with infinity"
- Feel the shift from "something's wrong that needs fixing" to "this is coherent with the path"

You can also use the word "Sana" as an actual greeting with friends who understand, or simply hold the consciousness without saying the word.

### Weekly Focus

This is day 7 of Scorpio week—the completion of the emotional deep dive. You've explored resentment, sadness, melancholy, hypocrisy, and more. You've faced shadow aspects you usually avoid.

Now comes the integration: **all of it is coherent with your infinite path.**

The struggles weren't mistakes. The shadow work wasn't proof of brokenness. The difficult emotions weren't failures. They were the curriculum. They were the playground. They were exactly what needed to happen.

Sana is the supervisor's loving acknowledgment of this truth.

### Living the Teaching

Practice supervisor consciousness throughout your day:

- When you witness someone's struggle, resist the urge to fix. Hold Sana consciousness.
- When you witness your own struggle, resist the urge to judge yourself as wrong. Hold Sana consciousness.
- Notice the difference between caring (which honors both pain and wholeness) and fixing (which only sees brokenness).

The supervisor doesn't abandon the children—they're present, loving, aware. But they trust the process. They know the struggles are the learning.

You can be present for yourself and others without taking on the burden of fixing every problem. This is the gift of Sana.

## Q&A

**Q: How is Sana consciousness different from spiritual bypassing?**

A: Bypassing uses the infinite perspective to avoid feeling the individual perspective. It says, "Your pain doesn't matter because it's all an illusion/lesson/divine plan." Sana holds BOTH: your pain is real, valid, important AND it's coherent with your infinite path. You feel the pain fully AND you trust the process. Both truths simultaneously, not one instead of the other.

**Q: Can I use Sana even if I don't believe in Atlantis?**

A: Yes. Whether Atlantis existed historically or is a symbolic memory doesn't matter for the practice. The teaching and the vibration are valuable regardless of their origin story. Use what serves your consciousness; release what doesn't.

**Q: What if someone's struggle is genuinely harmful or dangerous? Don't I need to intervene?**

A: The supervisor intervenes when there's real danger—that's part of the role. Sana consciousness doesn't mean passive acceptance of harm. It means: see the coherence with their path AND act when necessary. You can hold wholeness perspective while still setting boundaries, offering help, or taking action. The difference is you act from clarity, not from panic or judgment.

**Q: How do I know when to hold supervisor consciousness vs. when to dive into my individual experience?**

A: Both are always available. You toggle between them based on what's needed. When you're in the middle of strong emotion, dive in—feel it fully from individual perspective. When you need perspective or integration, shift to supervisor consciousness. They're not exclusive; they're complementary. The crown chakra allows you to move fluidly between them.

**Q: What if I can't access supervisor consciousness? What if I'm stuck in individual suffering?**

A: This is normal and human. Supervisor consciousness is a practice, not a permanent state. When you're deep in suffering, you might not be able to access it—that's okay. Feel what you feel. Later, when there's space, you can practice the shift. Over time, it becomes easier to toggle between perspectives even in the middle of struggle.

**Q: Can I say Sana to someone who's hurting me or who I'm in conflict with?**

A: Yes, but silently, as an internal practice. It helps you see that they, too, are coherent with their path, even in their harmful behavior. This doesn't excuse the harm or mean you don't set boundaries. It means you recognize their wholeness while still protecting yourself. You can hold Sana consciousness AND leave a toxic relationship. They're not contradictory.

**Q: Is Sana the same as "namaste" or other sacred greetings?**

A: Similar energy, different nuance. "Namaste" means "the divine in me bows to the divine in you." "Sana" means "I see you in your coherence with infinity." Both recognize sacred wholeness in the other. Use whichever resonates more for you—they're pointing at the same truth from different cultural/linguistic perspectives.

**Q: How can horrible things be "coherent with infinity"? What about abuse, war, tragedy?**

A: This is the hardest question. Sana consciousness doesn't mean horrible things are "good" or "meant to happen." It means: even in the darkest experiences, you are not separate from the infinite. Your path, however painful, is not a cosmic mistake. This is about finding meaning and wholeness, not justifying suffering. It's a perspective for integration, not an excuse for harm.

## Closing Reflection

Day 107 brings you an ancient gift: the Atlantean greeting **Sana**—I see you in your coherence with infinity.

After six days of deep emotional work in Scorpio, diving into shadow, examining resentment and hypocrisy and melancholy and all the parts you usually hide—you need this supervisor consciousness to integrate it all.

You are not broken. You were never broken. You are coherent with infinity, even in your struggles, even in your shadow, even in your deepest pain.

The struggles are not mistakes—they are the curriculum. The emotions are not failures—they are the lessons. The shadow is not proof of unworthiness—it's part of becoming whole.

Think of the school supervisor watching children learn through their conflicts and falls. The supervisor doesn't judge the children as wrong or broken. The supervisor sees: this is growth happening. This is the path.

You can offer yourself this same consciousness. You can offer it to others.

When you greet someone—whether silently in your heart or aloud with the actual word—with the awareness of Sana, you're saying:

**"I see you as whole. I see your struggle as real. I see your path as coherent with infinity. I trust your process. I don't need to fix you. I hold loving awareness of both your individual journey and your infinite nature."**

This is crown chakra consciousness—the ability to see wholeness without denying the parts, to see infinity without bypassing the individual experience.

Both are true. Both matter. Both are sacred.

The pain is real. The coherence is real. Hold both.

Sana.

*Day 107: Seeing coherence with infinity through all struggles.*
