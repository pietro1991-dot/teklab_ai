## Overview

Today is February 2, 2020—**2/2/2020**. And today is Day 183, which means we are at the **halfway point** of our 365-day journey. We have completed half of the path of "I Am." We stand in the portal of time and space, in the threshold between what was and what will be.

We connect today with the **throat chakra**—the portal of truth, the center of the voice, the vibration that speaks reality into existence. Our topic is **Cygnus**, the Swan constellation, also known as the **Northern Cross**, one of the most significant constellations in the northern sky and a key player in the Atlantean understanding of consciousness, time, and space.

Today's date—2/2/2020—is a **numerical code**. It's not that something magical happens automatically on this date; rather, it's a code that human consciousness can recognize and rally around. When we all see the same pattern (2-2-2020), we create a collective focal point. This code adds up to **8**, which is the number of the **toroid**—the shape of time, the eternal flow.

**This marks the beginning of a portal that will remain open until February 22, 2022 (2/22/2022)—another date that adds up to 12**, the number of the **dodecahedron**, representing the structure of space. Between these two dates—from the portal of time (8) to the portal of space (12)—we are living through a **transition**, a doorway from one reality to another.

What happened one month after 2/2/2020? COVID-19 and global lockdowns began. This chaotic, transformative period will not truly end until the beginning of 2022. We are in the **frame of the door**, walking from one room to another. This year (and the next) is the key for the transition of planetary consciousness.

And all of this is connected to **Cygnus**, the Northern Cross, and the Atlantean understanding of how to open portals between dimensions by connecting **time and space**.

## Core Teaching

### Cygnus: The Swan and the Northern Cross

**Cygnus** is one of the northern constellations, and its brightest star is **Deneb**, which in Arabic means "tail"—the tail of the swan. Deneb was the northern star approximately **15,000 to 16,000 years ago**, and it's also known as the **Cross of the North**.

In the southern hemisphere, there is the **Southern Cross** (properly called **Crux** in Latin, meaning "cross"). Crux is only visible from the southern hemisphere—if you're in the northern hemisphere, you will never see it. Similarly, Cygnus (the Northern Cross) is only visible from the northern hemisphere—if you're in the southern hemisphere, you will never see it.

These two crosses—**north and south**—represent a fundamental duality in Atlantean cosmology: **time and space**.

### Time and Space: The Two Crosses

**Cygnus (Northern Cross) = Time**  
The Northern Cross represents the **four times**: to be born, to grow, to reproduce, to die. In consciousness terms: to express, to experiment, to integrate, to transcend. This is the cycle of time—the process all beings move through.

**Crux (Southern Cross) = Space**  
The Southern Cross represents the **four spaces**: in front, behind, right, left. Or: north, south, east, west. This is the structure of space—the directions in which all beings can move.

### The Atlantean Cross: Connecting North and South

The Atlantean civilization understood that **in order to travel through space, you must activate the machinery of time**. Time and space are not separate—they are two aspects of one reality. To move through one, you must work with the other.

The **Atlantean Cross** was the key of their civilization. It involved **connecting the north and the south**—connecting time and space—to open **interdimensional portals**. They worked with the structure of Earth's alignment, using the solstices and equinoxes (spring, summer, autumn, winter) to manifest the four times in space.

Imagine it like this:

The Earth is in the center. Around it, you have:
- **Spring** (birth, east)
- **Summer** (growth, south)
- **Autumn** (reproduction/harvest, west)
- **Winter** (death/rest, north)

This creates a **cross**—two perpendicular lines intersecting at Earth. But in Atlantean understanding, this cross is not flat. It's a **cube**, or more accurately, a **dodecahedron**—a multidimensional structure.

### The Cube and the Dodecahedron

The Atlantean Cross is really a **cube**. Imagine a cube with Earth at its center. The corners of the cube are the solstices and equinoxes, the cardinal directions, the four times and four spaces manifesting simultaneously.

But a cube can be connected to an **inner cube**, creating a structure called a **dodecahedron**. And this cube can be expanded in different dimensions—going up, going down, coming out from each side, from below, from anywhere.

This is the **seed structure** of how Atlanteans opened portals: by creating geometric alignments that connected time (cycles) and space (locations) in a coherent pattern. They used this understanding to travel not through physical space (which takes too long) but through **dimensional space**—folding reality so that distant points touch.

## Practice

### Speaking Truth into the Portal

Today's practice is about using your throat chakra—your voice, your vibration—to consciously participate in the opening of this time-space portal.

**Step 1: Acknowledge the Threshold**  
Sit or stand with your spine straight. Place one hand on your throat. Recognize: "I am at the halfway point of my journey. I stand in the portal between time and space, between what was and what will be."

**Step 2: Visualize the Cross**  
Close your eyes. Visualize a cross of light—two perpendicular lines intersecting at your heart. One line runs north-south (space), the other runs through the cycles of time (birth-death, past-future).

See this cross expanding into a cube around you, with you at the center. You are the meeting point of time and space.

**Step 3: Speak Your Truth**  
The throat chakra is where truth is spoken. What is the truth you need to speak right now? Not to anyone else necessarily—to yourself, to the universe, to the portal?

It might be: "I am ready to transform." Or: "I release the old reality." Or: "I step through this door consciously."

Speak it aloud, clearly, with intention.

**Step 4: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"Ne"** three times, feeling it resonate in your throat, creating waves that ripple out into time and space.  
Then speak: **"I Am Emissary of Truth."**  
Your voice carries truth from the inner realms into manifest reality. You speak worlds into existence.

**Step 5: Detachment Practice**  
Cygnus and this portal require **detachment**—the ability to let go of what was and move into what's becoming. Name one thing you're attached to (a belief, a relationship, an identity, a pattern). Then speak: "I release my attachment to this. I move forward free."

## Key Insights

- **"Today, 2/2/2020, is a numerical code that adds to 8—the number of the toroid, representing time."**

- **"This portal remains open until 2/22/2022, which adds to 12—the number of the dodecahedron, representing space."**

- **"Between these dates, we live in the frame of the door, transitioning from one reality to another."**

- **"One month after 2/2/2020, COVID-19 and global lockdowns began—this transition won't fully end until early 2022."**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Mark the Portal:**  
Today, February 2, 2020, do something to consciously acknowledge that you are stepping into a two-year portal. Write in a journal: "I enter the portal of transformation. I walk from 2/2/2020 to 2/22/2022 with awareness."

Set an intention for what you want to transform during this period.

**Practice Detachment:**  
Detachment (the Aquarius theme) means releasing attachment to outcomes, to the way things "should" be, to control. Today, practice letting go of one small thing—a plan, an expectation, a judgment. Notice what it feels like to release.

**Speak One Truth:**  
Use your voice today to speak one truth you've been avoiding. It doesn't have to be to another person—it can be to yourself, written in a journal, spoken to the mirror. The throat chakra activates when truth is expressed.

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching today is cosmically vast—it's about time portals, dimensional travel, Atlantean technology, and the structure of spacetime. But it's also deeply personal: **you are at the halfway point of your journey**.

What have you learned in the first 182 days? What are you becoming? What old reality are you leaving behind? What new reality are you stepping into?

The portal from 2/2/2020 to 2/22/2022 is not just a global event—it's **your** transition. The chaos of this period (COVID, social upheaval, personal transformation) is not random. It's the **necessary dismantling** of old structures so new ones can emerge.

The Atlantean Cross teaches that time and space are one thing—they must be aligned, coherent, geometrically precise for portals to open. In your life, this means: align your inner time (your personal growth cycles) with your outer space (your physical actions and locations). When they match, doors open. When they're misaligned, you're stuck.

## Aquarius Mental Week Context

We are in the mental week of Aquarius, learning to think in terms of **networks, geometry, patterns, and future possibilities**. Cygnus and the Atlantean Cross are perfect examples of Aquarian thinking: recognizing that time and space are not separate linear progressions, but interconnected geometric structures that can be navigated consciously.

The throat chakra today (Ne - I Am Emissary of Truth) represents the power of **vibration and voice**—the ability to speak reality into form. Aquarius rules communication, networks, and the transmission of information. Your throat is the physical expression of this: you speak, and the world rearranges itself around your words.

This week is teaching you that **you are not passive in reality—you are actively creating it** through thought (Aquarius) and voice (throat chakra). The portal you're walking through is not something happening TO you; it's something you're participating in consciously.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does the 2/2/2020 to 2/22/2022 portal actually mean?

It's a symbolic frame—a container in time that human consciousness can recognize and use as a focal point for transformation. The numbers themselves (adding to 8 and 12, toroid and dodecahedron, time and space) create a resonance. During this period, planetary consciousness is shifting from one paradigm to another. The chaos (COVID, social unrest, personal upheavals) is the necessary breaking down of old structures. By 2022, a new foundation will begin to stabilize.

### Q: How did Atlanteans actually use the Cross to open portals?

They understood that time is cyclical (solstices, equinoxes) and space is directional (cardinal points). By creating physical structures (pyramids, stone circles) aligned to these cosmic patterns, and by gathering human consciousness at specific times in specific places, they could create **coherent vibrations** that opened dimensional doorways. It's similar to how a radio tuned to the right frequency can receive a broadcast—they tuned Earth's grid to cosmic frequencies.

### Q: What does it mean that Cygnus was the northern star 16,000 years ago?

It means that during that period, Earth's axis pointed toward stars in Cygnus. This created an energetic alignment between Earth and that region of the galaxy. Atlanteans used this alignment as part of their portal technology. The Northern Cross (Cygnus) helped them anchor the "time" side of the equation while the Southern Cross (Crux) anchored the "space" side.

### Q: How do I personally use my throat chakra to work with this portal?

By speaking truth. The throat chakra activates when you express what is real for you—not what you think others want to hear, not what's socially acceptable, but what is TRUE. During this portal period, your voice has extra power. What you speak, you create. Use it wisely. Speak your intentions, your boundaries, your vision for the future.

### Q: What is "detachment" in Aquarius terms?

Detachment is not coldness or not caring. It's **freedom from attachment to specific outcomes**. You can work toward a goal while being detached from whether it happens exactly as you envision. You can love someone while being detached from controlling them. Detachment allows you to flow through the portal without clinging to what's ending or forcing what's beginning.

### Q: Why is this the "halfway point" significant?

Because at the midpoint of any journey, you can look back and see how far you've come, and look forward and see how far you have yet to go. It's a natural moment for reflection, recalibration, and renewed commitment. You're not at the beginning anymore (where everything is new and exciting) and not at the end (where completion is in sight). You're in the **middle**—the place of endurance, integration, and choice.

### Q: How are time and space actually connected?

In physics, they are aspects of one thing: spacetime. You can't have space without time, or time without space. In consciousness terms, this means your **timeline** (your personal history and future) is connected to your **location** (where you are, who you're with, what you're doing). When you change one, you change the other. Atlanteans knew this—they could "travel" by shifting their timeline rather than moving through physical space.
