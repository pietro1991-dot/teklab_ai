## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

Whatever you are. I think we are coming back to the formality of the time where we are supposed to meet.

So today you can see my face really tired. Because today I had to wake up early in the morning like 5. 45 or 6. And we went to 3 temples and we spent the whole day all around and then ride the block and everything.

And tomorrow we have to leave at the same time and leave the boat at the same time.

So it 's so many , so many things that I think again I will sleep a little bit.

So sorry for my face today and tomorrow. Let 's go to the topic for today which is schemes. And we are connected today with the ankles. And remember that tomorrow we close the month of Capricorn.

So we are done with being in the cave learning about our our ancient history and all the work that was our history. And we will start to look into the future.

So first of all , let 's try to understand what is scheme for us today. For sure that all of us has been related to the concept of skimadization in school because the in school we had to learn how to make schemes in the process of learning because we needed to. And we have to put everything in in a correct order to understand a topic we needed to eskimadize this topic so we could understand better.

So one of the one of the things that we had to do during the process of learning is to know how to eskimadize as kimadize. I do n't know the way English to make a scheme of everything.

So this is why because of our our teaching and school in our common thoughts as cultural beings we have this preconception of the scheme being something that limit us. Because it tries to put a very big topic into just one thing smaller so we kind of perceive schemes like holding a pattern or. Or to put limits on something so we have this this idea this concept of creating a scheme or living our life through a schematic away. We used to think about this like something wrong or something.

Imitating in our lives. But the reason why we do that is because of the origin of the work the concept of skim. It comes from the from the Greek language schema that means the shape the form of something. And it comes from the the European language which is said that means to hold something to hold.

So this is why as kim mainly represents for us something that holds everything in one form and puts some limits on the things. That 's what we relate with the concept of schemes.

So I was just saying that when I was explained that I will explain now in English we we have to come back to school because this is something that we learned at school and and I 'm sorry for those of you who hated school learning this things. But sometimes to understand life we need to to go back to the to the main topics.

So in order to understand as kim. What we have to do is to go through a process that we call in English summary and diagram. And we will go to those two processes.

So to do that let 's go to school in school for sure you remember. You remember that the the teachers usually give you like this big text with a lot of information and they said you have to make. You have to make a scheme you have to make a summary of all the information and outline of what is this topic.

Okay , that was something that we all have to do in the school.

So in order to do that you have to make a summary summary we usually related with. Putting all that in a small thing so like taking information to keep keep with just the important things but it 's not that summary comes from the word sum. Which is to add things not to rest things okay it 's totally the opposite.

So make a summary is to put all the things that were spread in a big text put all of it all the heavy of it into just a few words.

So this word has the sum of all the other concepts is not like you take many things so you have just the important things is that you take all information into just. Tiny things okay , so that 's why we call summary.

Okay , and in order to get a summary you need to make a diagram. What is a diagram a diagram is a Greek word that comes from the that means to go through and gram that means to write.

So diagram means to go through the writing okay and what is this that when you read a text that you try to understand the whole text. In order to keep the storyline. What you have to do is to pick up some words through the text and write it down like in the line of the text.

So those words will be the key to remember the concepts of every paragraph.

So you are summing. Sunrise. The concepts of each paragraph into one word. And through that you connect the topics of each paragraph to have the idea and that 's what we call the diagram.

And all that is the outline of a story that we know with word scheme.

Okay , scheme is this last structure that you have of the entire text , which is the summary.

So that 's what we have learned at school for sure in language class.

So what does the scheme gives the shape to all information that was spread around.

So all this content , this this information that was all around.

Now it 's put on a frame.

So that 's why we call it a framework.

Okay , it puts some limits on it.

So it does n't matter the structure. It is a frame.

So it can be a triangle , a circle , it does n't matter.

So the shape it does n't matter , but it limits the concept. The process of getting this this scheme helps us to understand the world. Everything that we have around everything that is spread in the in the in the cosmos is so much data , so much information. That if we put all of it together in only one concept like collecting all the important things and we put it in just one symbol.

We later can just by seeing that symbol in that frame. We can understand all the data information that is behind it without the need of going step by step to see all the things.

So this is this is why this center , this this this concept is what gives us the ability to be intelligence intelligent comes from the Latin word interleggare. Interleggare means to read in between the lines because legate which is the origin of read. Basically means to collect things.

So when you read you are collecting different concepts and things to yourself.

Okay , so that 's the meaning of a legate. And then when you have inter it means in between.

So when you collect things in between. And that speaks about the ability that the humans have to understand from a big concept just a few ideas and we put it together in one symbol and behind that symbol we through the ability to have intelligence. We understand the symbol and that 's why the humans are different from other animals because we have this specialty that we can be intelligent that means to collect ideas and put them on one concept. The importance of schemes are the ones that of this concepts.

Is is is that helps us to understand how the normal things that we use every day daily. They have so much weight and so much information that we do n't even notice about that because we normalize all the things around us.

So the example that I wrote in the blog today for example it was the letter A. The letter A the sound A that sound is has a such a weight of history that all the meanings in that tiny letter that we use every day. The summary the scheme of 2004 hundred years of history.

So for example letter A we all know the letter A like this okay but what happened in history the letter A was first like this and then it started to turn and turn until we know now the letter A.

So for example. This letter like this before was the letter was in like this the A was the letter for the Egyptians okay after the Egyptians it turned like this to finish in from finish in turn like this to Greek and from the Greek it turns like this to the Romans the Latin.

So that 's how the letter has been spinning according to the writings of each culture. Or show you so you have it. This are the four positions of the letter A in Egyptian times. Finishes Greek and Roman time.

The letter A was spinning just 180 degrees.

So the letter A was called alpha. In Greek times. In finishing times was called ali. And in Egyptian time was called apps.

All of them means. Means bull. The bull.

So the letter A means bull and comes from the head of a bull.

So imagine that why the A is the first letter of the of the alphabet. Because in the moment when all the ancient concepts were creating the letter. The letter it was during the time of. The constellation of stores.

So during those two thousand four hundred years. It was all the history. In which the constellation of stores was the only communication between humans and the divine. And that 's why for them the stores was the beginning of everything.

The stores was basically the one that opened the the ground.

So we can solve. The cow was the one given the milk.

So we could feed the families.

So this meant that. That the cow and the bull. We 're so important for that period of time that they that they connected the origin and the connection with the divine with the stores.

So that was the beginning of life. That 's why through the Mediterranean sea. All the cultures creating a stores based culture. That was the the main symbol of all these traditions.

And apps was like the beginner of all this.

So that 's why for that culture. The A the representative of the stores was the first letter. That 's it. It was the foundation of the knowledge of life.

So now you can we can see the whole process and how can we see the whole process. If the cow the bull is the one that opens the ground to sow the seeds.

So the beginning of life the wealth of everything I was created.

So the one that must close the whole process. Is the divine watching itself creating the whole thing. All the creation itself analyzing observing contemplating everything. The path that it took to get to the divine.

That 's why the last letter of the A B of the alphabet is Omega. Omega is the great. Oh and the great. Oh is talking about the eye because I come from.

The way that comes from Ucat in Egyptian that means I.

So the letter O is related to the origin. I. And that 's why is the great eye that sees everything. Omega is the great eye the god.

Okay.

So that 's why. The the last letter is the one observing the whole path. Imagine that in that time it was impossible to describe the universe. It was impossible to describe the expansion of all the knowledge and all the things that existed around in the cosmos.

So how could they put all that data all that information in just one tiny concept.

So we could all understand what it is.

So it describes the first thing that is created with the seed in the ground and then the divine. The whole cosmos in the invisible that is watching.

So all that together is called alpha and omega. That 's why. I created. The name of God.

This is why it was so complicated to describe God and the path of existence that the best way to name God was to say alpha and omega.

So everything the universe. Basically as Kim a framework. A concept of the whole. Existence of the universe.

So here we have a great paradox. In the universe to try to understand how everything is a summary. And we will try to understand it in this way. Let 's begin by this design.

Hmm. The universe is only one thing only one dot. That 's it. And this being is projected into the whole universe by polarity , positive and negative as we already have spoken so much.

One of the things that we have to understand is that the cosmos is not projecting outside as to is basically expanding outside from within. That 's the real way to understand it.

So. I 'm going to make it again because. I 'm going to.

So this is a way to understand how the universe expands. In positive and negative.

Okay. And of course this is not like this , but this is a. Kim is a framework okay to understand it. From the center expands in positive and negative.

So it creates the polarity. Hmm. Yeah.

So it does n't matter the order where you put each one of them , but it 's a concept okay.

So. This universe will create a concept that is subconscious another one conscious and another one unconscious. Hmm.

Okay.

So the center of this structure will be polarized in positive and negative. That 's why it 's the unconscious because this move is moved by. By by everything.

So I would have. As subconscious structure that I call alpha and I 'm conscious aspect that we call omega.

So omega will be the eye that sees everything and. The alpha will be the expression the manifestation of that thing that is being seen.

Okay.

So what the subconscious the. One of them will do is to divide itself. From the unity into many different options.

Okay.

So many thousands of options. That we create.

So it can leave the. The different ways of itself. Hmm.

So the universe being only one will expand itself in millions of beings. And then this millions of options will come back to the unity creating only oneself. As Kim. To describe the the whole thing.

So this individual can be experiencing all these options.

So to understand this. The unity expense itself in. Strings of time creating the different dimensions different options.

So you can see here like the strings of a of an harp of our guitar.

So you see the vibration here.

So this projects the dimensions. And then by positive and negative it creates different options. That will create the bodies of my ancestors in different spaces.

So different people that lived in different moments of history that will make a summary in me. In this point here.

So I am the scheme the result. The framework. Of this outline. Of this diagram that came from the unity.

This is why the only answer possible to everything. Is. I am. I am the alpha and your mega.

Each one of us is just the summary. This schematic structure. Of. Thousands and billions of years of evolution.

Of different beings in different times and different spaces. To understand this. I am. The a the letter a of the universe.

So I am the summary of the whole potential of the cosmos. In just. One little. Concert.

I am the a and this a. Can write poems or can send to kill. This a can write. Beautiful stories.

Or horrible things. I letter can be used for thousands of years. For thousands of things. Different things.

But still. It 's just a letter.

So. The whole universe. Finds itself in a scheme in a frame. Of just a tiny thing.

But how I use that tiny thing. It 's what makes the difference.

So we usually. Used to say. We are the universe or the universe lives within you. But in a very.

Pies is way. Which means that. You have the universe within you can feel entire universe and you can be your own creator and so on.

So so. There are concepts so big in pieces that you can not. Yet exactly how to get it because you you may say yes. I am the universe but then in practice is like , but what do I do?

I I do n't know how to apply this universe that I have within I can feel it. I get depressed.

So let 's go into much more capricornian way of understanding. We are our own universe. Basically because the universe that we know the energy to go one and the physical one. The one that creates atoms.

Controllers that every atom. Chemical element that we have. In our body. Are the same atoms that are in the stars and the constellations in the I 'm sorry in the in the stars in the sun in the moon in the asteroids everywhere.

So that means that if I am the summary of all this same chemical elements that are all around the cosmos and all of them. Throughout the cosmos we are able to create life and all this wonder. That means that if I am the summary of all of that in this frame. Which is the body.

So I have the universe within so I can be a creator too. To rub the idea. In the same way as the letter A is the summary of 2,400 years of history By. I myself , each one of us is a summary of thousands of billions of years of existence.

And that 's why we are as keen of the universe. Because we are a great content. As a summary in this tiny body.

Okay.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is dual. The statement for today is I am the essence of the profound. The code for today is magnesium.

## Practice Structure

Most of it is found in oceans and like all life originated from them. Magnesium is fundamental. In the plant kingdom , better like kingdom , has a very important role in photosynthesis to produce the necessary energy for plants. And in the same way in the animal kingdom is a necessary component to keep the structure of the NA and NA.

Like to improve the formation of neurotransmitter. This element energies and at the same time relates the physical body. And is the eighth element in quality on the terrestrial cortex. Let 's go to the line.

See the comfortable close your eyes. The focus.

Now we 're breathing.

Softly. And with consciousness. I start to carry out the entire body messaging it from my feet to my head. And then I start to carry out the entire body messaging it from my feet to my head.

And then I start to carry out the entire body messaging it from my feet to my head. I become aware of my feet , my legs , belly , back , hands and arms , chest , neck and head. Getting breath. I become aware of the air around me , of the light , the colors that surrounds me , the place where I find myself , all the objects and people in the same room that I am and take a deep breath.

I become aware of the entire space where you find yourself at home and building a neighborhood , pay attention , you see your on the ground , on the air , on the water , all the people that is sharing this same space with you and take a deep breath. Of the region , the country that I find myself in , the culture of this land , the traditions , the history , the cities or the nature , I become aware of this place in the world , where I become , take a deep breath. I become aware of the continent I find myself in , all the countries , the people , the magical kingdom , the animals , the minerals that are in this continent with me. Take a deep breath.

I become aware of the planet I find myself in , the earth , all its continents , oceans , every species , and I become aware of the entire history of this planet , the history of what 's me , from the first cell in the oceans , to my dad and mom , to myself , take a deep breath. I become aware of the solar system where I find myself with its sun , the planets , the asteroids , the galaxy I find myself in , the Milky Way , with all its constellations. With all its constellations. The breeze and I become aware of all the galaxies in entire universe.

The breeze. I become aware of all the dimensions through time and space. Where I find myself in my recognized that I am a multidimensional beam. I am a multidimensional beam.

## Guided Meditation

I recognize that all this that exists is just liberation , energy and matter. I breathe. I recognize that the matter are just particles and the energy in them. It 's just magnetism and the vibration of it is just the correspondence of the universal mind.

Take it breath. I expand myself and I recognize that this vibration is magnetism. This particles are the basis of myself , my first self. I self contains all of it.

Take it breath. I am from this cell. I expand and recognize the billions of cells that create my body. Why I am?

The cells that create my muscles , organs and bones. Take it breath. I recognize I am the summary of the entire universe. And they always sound with this consciousness.

I am from this cell. I am the depth of the universe. I am the essence of the profound. I am the essence of the profound.

I am the essence of the profound. I am the depth of the universe. I am the alpha , the alpha omega. I am the essence of the profound.

I am the essence of the profound. I am the essence of the profound. I am the essence of the profound. I am the essence of the profound.

And you start to come back here and now my racing is stretching the body. Bring in all this consciousness throughout the body. Thank you everybody for being there as always. See you tomorrow at the same time.
