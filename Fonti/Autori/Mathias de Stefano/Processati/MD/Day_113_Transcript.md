## Overview

The third day of the Physical Week explores hearing and the throat chakra, introducing the powerful concept of the "third ear." While we have two physical ears that capture external sound, the throat acts as the third ear—when we express our own voice through speaking, we hear ourselves from within.

Matias opens with humor, sharing an Atlantean greeting and playing with language to illustrate how sound carries meaning beyond literal words. This teaching reveals that modern society has lost the art of listening, replacing dialogue with volume battles where everyone shouts louder instead of truly hearing each other.

Like vision yesterday, hearing operates through three levels of consciousness—conscious, unconscious, and subconscious. The examples given are concrete: asking a friend directly about wearing blue (conscious), having a stranger comment unprompted that blue suits you (unconscious), and absorbing ambient references to "blue" at a party that unconsciously influences your clothing choice days later (subconscious).

The physical structure of the inner ear, which contains liquid that maintains balance regardless of body movement, reveals the spiritual teaching: everything we hear determines our emotional balance. This is why emotional imbalance plagues modern society—we have forgotten how to listen.

## Core Teaching

### The Third Ear: Throat as Self-Hearing

We have two ears on the sides of our head that perceive external sounds—voices, music, nature, machines. But there is a **third ear** that most people never consciously recognize: **the throat**.

When you speak, expressing your own voice outward, you simultaneously hear yourself from within. The throat is the organ that allows you to hear your own truth being spoken. This is why speaking and hearing are connected in the same chakra—they are two aspects of one function.

The gift of hearing is not complete if you only listen to others. True hearing requires that you also **speak your power, express your voice, and listen to yourself speaking**. When these three aspects align—hearing others, speaking your truth, and hearing yourself—you find balance.

Many people listen constantly to external voices but never speak their own truth, never activate the third ear. Others speak constantly but never truly listen to others or themselves. Both are imbalanced.

The throat chakra teaches: **To truly hear, you must also be heard. To truly speak, you must also listen.**

### The Evolution of Mammalian Hearing

To understand what hearing truly offers us, we must trace how this sense evolved in mammals.

Early life forms had no hearing. They perceived vibrations through touch and pressure changes in water or on surfaces. This was proto-hearing—feeling sound rather than hearing it.

As life evolved on land, **hearing developed as a survival tool**. Predators could detect prey by sound; prey could detect approaching predators. The ability to hear rustling, footsteps, breathing, or calls meant the difference between life and death.

But mammals evolved hearing beyond survival into **cultural and communication tools**. Unlike reptiles, which use sound primarily for mating calls and territorial warnings, mammals developed complex vocalizations for:

- **Parental bonding** (mothers and infants recognizing each other's calls)
- **Pack coordination** (wolves howling to gather the pack)
- **Emotional expression** (whales singing across ocean distances)
- **Knowledge transmission** (dolphins teaching hunting strategies through specific click patterns)

Humans took this evolutionary capacity to its highest expression: **language**—the ability to use sound to transmit abstract concepts, share complex ideas, build culture across generations, and coordinate large-scale social structures.

But this evolution brought a shadow: the capacity to use sound as weapon, to manipulate through words, to create noise that drowns out truth.

### The Three Levels of Hearing: Conscious, Unconscious, Subconscious

Like sight yesterday, hearing operates through three distinct levels of consciousness, each absorbing different types of information:

#### Conscious Hearing: Asked-For Information

Conscious hearing is what you deliberately listen for—information you request and actively focus on receiving.

**Example:** You ask a friend, "Do you think blue suits me?" They answer, "Yes, blue looks great on you." You consciously heard this because you asked for it and paid attention to the response.

This is the smallest portion of what you hear, perhaps only 5-10% of total auditory input. It's the spotlight of attention focused on specific sounds or words.

#### Unconscious Hearing: Unsolicited Comments That Stick

Unconscious hearing captures information you didn't ask for but that someone delivers directly to you in a way that bypasses conscious filters and lodges in your mind.

**Example:** You're walking down the street wearing a blue shirt. A stranger passes and says, "Blue really suits you." You didn't ask, you weren't thinking about your appearance, but the comment sticks. Days later, you find yourself reaching for blue clothing more often.

This is not subconscious (you consciously heard the person speak), but it's unconscious because it operates below your deliberate awareness. The information entered without your permission and influenced your choices without conscious examination.

This level is where **cultural programming, social conditioning, and random influences** take root. It's why advertising works—repeated messages that you "hear" but don't consciously process can shape your preferences and behaviors.

#### Subconscious Hearing: Ambient Data Absorption

Subconscious hearing is the vast ocean of sound you absorb without any conscious awareness at all—background conversations, environmental noises, distant music, echoes, the rhythm of traffic, the hum of electricity.

**Example:** You're at a party having a conversation. You're not consciously listening to other conversations around you, but throughout the night, various people at different moments mention the word "blue" in their separate conversations. You don't consciously hear any of these references.

But three days later, when choosing an outfit, you inexplicably feel drawn to wear blue. You have no idea why—the word was planted in your subconscious through ambient repetition, and now it's influencing your behavior without your conscious mind ever knowing it heard anything.

**The Reggaeton Example:** Matias mentions how certain songs (like Reggaeton) get stuck in your head not because you chose to listen but because they were playing in the background repeatedly. Your subconscious absorbed the rhythm, melody, and lyrics, and now they loop in your mind without your permission.

This demonstrates the power and danger of subconscious hearing: **it absorbs everything in your auditory environment and uses that data to shape your thoughts, feelings, and choices without your conscious awareness.**

This is why the environments you spend time in matter enormously. If you're constantly surrounded by negative conversation, aggressive music, fearful news broadcasts, or chaotic noise, your subconscious absorbs that data and creates emotional and mental patterns accordingly—even if you think you're "not really listening."

### Humans as Echoes, Not Creators

One of the most challenging teachings about hearing is this: **Approximately 80% of the information we speak and express is echo—repetition of what we've heard from others—not original creation.**

Think about your beliefs, your opinions, your knowledge. How much of it did you genuinely create through your own direct experience and contemplation? How much of it did you absorb from parents, teachers, friends, media, books, culture?

Most people are echo chambers, repeating sounds they've heard without examining whether those sounds are true or even whether they agree with them. This is not shameful—it's the natural result of how hearing works at the unconscious and subconscious levels.

But **the spiritual path requires becoming conscious of the echo and learning to create original sound**—speaking your authentic truth rather than repeating the programming you've absorbed.

This is why the throat chakra is so crucial to awakening. Until you learn to distinguish between echo and creation in your own voice, you cannot fully awaken. You're still operating on autopilot, speaking and thinking thoughts that aren't actually yours.

### The Modern Crisis: Everyone Shouting, Nobody Listening

The problem with contemporary society is that we have collectively **lost the art of listening**. Instead of dialogue—two or more people truly hearing each other—we have monologues shouted over each other.

Political discourse: people shouting their positions louder, not listening to opposing views or seeking understanding.

Social media: everyone broadcasting their thoughts, very few genuinely listening to others.

Relationships: partners talking over each other, waiting for their turn to speak rather than actually hearing what the other is saying.

Work environments: meetings where everyone defends their position, nobody seeks synthesis or collaboration.

The cultural pattern is clear: **if I'm not being heard, I shout louder. If shouting louder doesn't work, I shout even louder.** But this creates an arms race of volume where communication breaks down entirely.

True hearing—the gift of the throat chakra—is **finding balance through harmony, not dominance through volume.**

When you shout, you're trying to force others to hear you. When you listen, you're creating space for truth to emerge. These are opposite energies, and modern culture has almost entirely abandoned the listening side.

This is why we are so emotionally imbalanced collectively. Everything we hear—all that shouting, all that noise, all that aggression—goes straight into our emotional body and creates disturbance.

### The Inner Ear and Physical Balance

There is a profound physical teaching embedded in the structure of the ear itself.

Inside your inner ear, there is **liquid contained in a shell-shaped structure (like a snail)**. This liquid maintains perfect level regardless of how your head and body move. When you tilt your head, the liquid stays level like water in a cup.

This liquid communicates with the brain through thousands of tiny connections. When your body moves or tilts, the liquid's position relative to the inner ear structure tells your brain: "You're falling left—adjust!" Your brain instantly signals the appropriate muscles to shift your balance and keep you upright.

This is why your ears are responsible for physical balance. Damage to the inner ear causes vertigo and balance disorders.

The spiritual teaching hidden in this physiology: **Everything you hear determines your emotional balance, just as inner ear liquid determines your physical balance.**

- Everything you listen to from the physical world brings balance (or imbalance) to your physical body
- Everything you listen to through your three levels of consciousness determines your emotional balance

This is why people who constantly listen to violent news, aggressive music, negative conversations, or fearful rhetoric become emotionally imbalanced—anxious, angry, depressed, unstable. The auditory input is literally throwing off their emotional equilibrium, exactly the way damaged inner ear liquid throws off physical equilibrium.

The solution: **conscious curation of what you allow into your auditory field**. Choose music, conversations, environments, and media that create emotional balance rather than disturbance.

### Practicing Meditation with Noise

One of the most powerful practices for developing conscious hearing is to **meditate in noisy environments** rather than only in silence.

Most people think meditation requires absolute quiet. But this creates dependency—you can only find peace when external conditions are perfect. This is not true mastery.

Instead, go to a public place—a park, a café, a busy street—and meditate there. Hear the cars passing. Breathe in the sound of the cars and use it for meditation. Hear people talking. Take that talk into your meditation. Use the noises as a way to find balance through listening.

Why this works: **By learning to meditate with noise, you understand silence more deeply.** Silence is not the absence of sound—it's the presence of inner stillness regardless of external sound.

When you can hear chaos around you and maintain peace within, you've developed true hearing. You've learned to use all sound—pleasant and unpleasant, harmonious and chaotic—as fuel for your practice rather than as obstacles.

This is the gift of hearing: **transforming all vibration into balance.**

### For Those Without Physical Hearing

People who are deaf or have lost their hearing have not lost the gift of the throat chakra. They simply access it through a different channel: **vibration**.

All sound is vibration. Hearing is simply one way to perceive vibration. But vibration can be felt through the body, seen through visual patterns, intuited through energy.

Those without hearing often develop heightened sensitivity to vibration itself—feeling the bass of music through their chest, sensing when someone approaches by floor vibrations, reading emotional energy through visual cues and body language.

The spiritual practice for those without physical hearing is to **pay attention to vibration in all its forms**. The teaching is the same: find balance through perceiving and harmonizing with the vibrational field.

## Practice: Tree of Life and Sound Integration

This meditation integrates hearing with the Tree of Life visualization, helping you find balance through conscious listening.

### Steps

1. **Body Awareness**  
   Take a deep breath. Begin massaging from your crown toward your feet, touching each part of your body. As you touch each area, affirm: "I am here to work for this body's greatest good."

2. **Entering the Forest**  
   Close your eyes. Visualize yourself in a forest. Begin walking deeper into it.  
   
   **Listen to the sounds:** birds singing, insects buzzing, wind moving through leaves, your footsteps on the earth.  
   
   As you walk deeper, the forest becomes a rainforest—darker, denser, filled with more complex layers of sound.

3. **The Great Tree**  
   In front of you appears the biggest tree of all, with huge roots and branches.  
   
   **Listen to its sound:** the creaking of branches, the rustle of millions of leaves, the sap moving through the trunk, the roots drinking water deep underground.

4. **Lying in the Roots**  
   Recognize this as the Tree of Life. Lie down between its roots, watching the sky above.  
   
   **Listen to the silence beneath the sound.** Even with all the noise of the forest, there is a deeper silence holding it all.

5. **Becoming a Root**  
   Feel yourself becoming a root of this tree. Recognize the importance of being connected to this living structure.

6. **Listening to the Void**  
   As you sink into the mud and roots, practice listening to the void—the space between sounds, the silence that makes sound possible.  
   
   Affirm: "I am the emptiness that neutralizes all sound into balance."

7. **Three-Level Listening**  
   - **Consciously** listen to specific sounds you choose to focus on  
   - **Unconsciously** notice sounds that arise without your seeking them  
   - **Subconsciously** allow all ambient sound to be present without analyzing it

8. **Speaking Your Truth**  
   From your position as a root, imagine your voice rising through the trunk, through the branches, into the leaves.  
   
   Speak silently or aloud: "I express my truth. I hear my truth. I am balanced."

9. **Return**  
   Slowly bring your awareness back to your physical body. Continue listening to all sounds around you without judgment.  
   
   Open your eyes when ready, maintaining the balance you found.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Conscious Sound Curation

Today, pay attention to what you allow into your auditory field. Notice what music you play, what conversations you engage in, what media you consume. Choose at least one hour today to expose yourself only to sounds that create emotional balance—nature sounds, harmonious music, kind conversations, or silence.

### Weekly Focus: Noise Meditation

Three times this week, practice meditating in a noisy environment. Go somewhere with traffic, conversation, music, or activity. Instead of trying to block out the noise, practice using each sound as part of your meditation—breathing with it, allowing it, transforming it into fuel for inner stillness.

### Living the Teaching

When in conversation this week, practice true listening. Instead of planning what you'll say next while the other person speaks, actually hear them. When you speak, notice whether you're echoing ideas you've absorbed or expressing original truth from your own experience. Practice the balance between listening and speaking.

## Questions & Reflections

**Q: How can I tell if I'm speaking echo or original truth?**

Ask yourself: "Where did this idea come from? Did I discover it through my own direct experience, or did I absorb it from someone else?" Echo feels like reciting; original truth feels like revealing. Echo comes from memory; truth comes from presence.

**Q: If 80% of what I express is echo, how do I increase the original 20%?**

Through direct experience and contemplation. Spend more time in silence, in nature, in meditation, in your own company. The more you listen to yourself and life directly, the less you need to repeat what others have said.

**Q: Why is listening so hard in modern society?**

Because listening requires surrendering the need to be right, to control, to dominate. In a culture built on competition and individual achievement, listening feels like losing. But actually, listening is where wisdom enters.

**Q: Can sound actually heal or harm the physical body?**

Absolutely. Sound is vibration, and your body is a vibrational instrument. Certain frequencies promote healing, coherence, and cellular harmony. Others create stress, inflammation, and disorder. This is why music therapy, sound baths, and chanting have real physiological effects.

**Q: What if I live in a noisy environment I can't control—traffic, neighbors, city sounds?**

Practice the noise meditation teaching. You can't always control external sound, but you can always choose your internal response. Transform the noise into meditation material rather than fighting it. This builds resilience and inner peace independent of circumstances.

**Q: How do I speak my truth without hurting others?**

Truth and cruelty are not the same. Speaking your truth means expressing your authentic experience, feelings, and needs—not attacking others. You can say "I feel hurt when..." without saying "You're terrible because..." Authentic expression honors both your truth and others' dignity.

**Q: Why does music get stuck in my head even when I don't want it there?**

Your subconscious absorbed the rhythm, melody, and lyrics through repetition. Now it's processing that data, looping it to integrate it. This shows how powerful subconscious hearing is—it literally programs your mental space without permission. Be conscious about what music you expose yourself to repeatedly.

**Q: How can I develop better balance if my inner ear is damaged?**

Physical balance issues require medical care, but emotional balance can still be cultivated through conscious hearing practices. Focus on harmonious sound, silence, and vibration even if physical vertigo persists. The emotional and spiritual balance is independent of physical ear function.

## Closing Reflection

Today you have learned that hearing is not a passive reception of sound but an active practice of balance. Everything you allow into your auditory field shapes your emotional body, your thoughts, and your choices—consciously or unconsciously.

The modern world is shouting. Everyone is trying to be heard by speaking louder, but nobody is listening. This creates collective emotional chaos, instability, and conflict. The solution is not to shout louder yourself—it's to become someone who truly listens.

When you listen deeply, you hear not just words but intention, emotion, truth, and lie. You hear the echo versus the original sound. You hear what is spoken and what remains unspoken. This is the development of spiritual hearing—the third ear awakening.

And when you speak from your awakened throat chakra, you are not repeating programmed responses or defending ego positions. You are expressing authentic truth from direct experience. Others hear this differently—they feel it resonate because it's not echo, it's original vibration.

The gift of hearing is the gift of balance through harmony. Let all sound—beautiful and harsh, harmonious and chaotic, silent and loud—flow through you and become transformed into balance. This is mastery.

Practice meditating with noise. Practice listening more than speaking. Practice speaking only truth, not echo. And watch as your emotional balance stabilizes regardless of how loud the world around you becomes.

**Statement:** I am the emptiness that neutralizes  
**Code:** Unconscious Experimentation

*Just as the subconscious implies all the possible past that constitutes me, this means I am the history. In the unconscious aspect, I am the result of my surroundings, of my present. What surrounds me, what I feel, listen, live, and do in my everyday, what I see and perceive, modifies myself and makes me act based on that, with the objective of surviving in that environment.*
