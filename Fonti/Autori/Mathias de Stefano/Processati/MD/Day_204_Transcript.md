## Introduction

Hi everybody , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

## Q&A

So before we start , just a tiny point that I wanted to say regarding the post that I did about the tasks , the exams of Mercury. Just a reminder for those who are following everything here in YouTube , that there are many things that I am posting in Instagram , in the blog , in Facebook , that I am not posting here , and I 'm not even speaking about that here.

So if you want to follow exactly what I am doing and what the tasks are , I recommend for you to follow also in the blog , which isyourself. Red. Yourself is I am Spanish and red , like the color , but it means network.

So remember to vote there or also inyourself. Red in Instagram and Facebook.

Okay , there I will post everything. And of course for those people that are not following social media , I thank all of you. If you helped them to know everything that I am posting , publish in it here in the comments or in other networks. As I was saying this year is a lot of work , so this is what we are doing this year.

So I will explain a little bit about what was the post that I did yesterday.

So the post that I did today is regarding the concept that until every next year when we finish this path , we will have three processes of Mercury retrograde. Who does n't know what is Mercury retrograde? Reds from great. Look into the video , watch the video before of this one.

From yesterday. This means that in the next year from this February to the other February , we will be having three processes of this Mercury retrograde , which each one of these processes are three weeks each.

So during those three weeks , we will be making a review of our physical in the first time. Then in the second three weeks , we will do the emotional and the last one will be the spiritual.

So it 's a review of the information.

So the idea of this reviews that we are going to take is to see if we were able to assimilate many of the concepts that we have been working through this year.

So this review is not that I am going to make an exam for you. It 's not that. Is that the period is about examination of oneself.

So I will be reminded us all , reminding us all that those three weeks , we will have to think about this review that we have to do. Regarding our physical , our emotional and our physical and our spiritual.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the propulsion that I did to get ready for all this preparation of the whole year is just to say the statements before we go to sleep. Of I am wisdom , I am love , etc. The six attributes , okay.

So we start the yesterday , we started yesterday , the favorite of the second. And until March 21st , all those days before we go to sleep , which is say the affirmation. I am wisdom. I am wisdom.

All the same , I am wisdom every day before we go to sleep. And the 20 second of March we start I am love for all the days saying exactly the same. And then we 'll and so on.

So we can all be in the same balance , activated in the mercabout of all together.

Okay , so that 's the idea. But as I said , this is written in the social media. And it does n't matter if you did n't begin it from the very beginning. If you did n't start it from the very beginning , you just can start wherever you are.

So today Venus , the heart. First of all , let 's go to the origin of the name Venus. Venus comes from the word when in the European languages. And this word means desire and love.

And we have to go to the very beginning of what is love for human in the first time. In the first time , love was related with the concept of desire because love was only understood because of reproduction.

Okay , now we do n't do that. But in the very beginning , it was like that.

So love was related with the need to be in touch with other , to relate with others.

## Energy Work

So we can recreate. This is why the word love and desire is the same. It comes from the same root. This two , now we can understand it like the desire being the unconscious point of view and love the conscious point of view.

The word Venus is also the origin of the word to generate , to honor someone. But to generate someone is to desire a lot someone or something or a God.

So Venus is the for the Romans. Is the name of the goddess of love , of generation , of creation , of beauty , exactly the same as for the Greek , Afro-Dita.

So it 's important to say that all the concept of this goddess , it was not a goddess by itself. It was a goddess that represented the whole that put all together , all the months together , because for the ancient ones , in the ancient traditions , the mother was the main thing. The mother was the original element for to create life.

So everything was related to the mother , to the spirit of the mother.

So it was sacred because everyone came from the mother.

So all the mothers together created the concept of one weight and sacred mother that was the goddess of life , the goddess of beauty , the goddess of reproduction , of sexuality of life , love and so on.

So all the traditions of the ancient world , they honor the uterus , the wound , the belly of the feminine , the vagina , the books , everything. Of the feminine body because it was perfect because it was the mother of creation. And also of course this goddess , this concept represented sexuality , because in order for something to be born , you need sex.

So sexuality , sexuality and all these things were something sacred too. We kind of put it , we kind of separate that concept because we have been many centuries and also thousands of years thinking from the point of view of magnetism.

So they separated sexuality as something that is wrong and we today think that we need to transcend that in order to get to the divine but it 's not like this because it 's about religion and concepts. For the very beginning of humanity , the concept of love was related with sex and it was sacred at the same level.

So as all the other gods , all the other divine beings , Venus is not a real person in the concept that holds all the idea of maternity , of love , of creation. Venus is one of the brightest things in the sky.

So we have the sun , then the moon and then Venus and then we have serious. But Venus is the brightest that seems like a star that is shining in the sky. For the ancient ones , Venus was like this moving star that was bringing the light. It was the ringer up light from the sun to the worlds.

So because this idea of the star bringing the light from the sun , they related the idea of bringing the beauty , the consciousness , it was the ringer of light here on earth. The creation of beauty of all the things. This is why all the other cultures , all the cultures used to call this planet the ringer of light. For sure you have heard how Venus used to call it that was nana java.

It was the brightest light , it was the mother bringing the clarity and the beauty to this world.

So for the Persians , it was await and for the Mediterranean people , it was banned. For Egypt of course is haber.

So for the Egyptians is haber and for the Greeks , after the attack and for the Romans , Venus.

So the Greek people used to call this star also phosphorus. That means the one that brings the light.

So the Romans used to call it also the one that brings the light and they call it in Latin , lukepheros. Lukepheros is lucefer. It 's the name of lucefer.

So just to take the idea of what is lucefer in our cultures , let 's remember that this name is an epithet. It 's a surname , no surname , nickname , sorry , it 's like a nickname for the for this planet.

So in Latin , luke 's means light and force means the one that brings.

So the one that brings the light is lukepheros.

So the reason why we call the devil as lucefer is because in the first moments , in the first traditions , the one that we now call the devil was the first key to the first song of God. He was the first angel that was helping by bringing the light to each one of the plants.

So he was doing that until there was a moment that itself , he said , I do n't want to do this anymore. I want to do it in my own.

So God said , how it 's your own way.

So lucefer said , well , it 's through the opposite.

So it created the opposite side , which is the darkness.

So that 's how he tried to do it as an enemy , as in the opposite side. And that 's in the Middle East , they call that the one that is against someone , they call it shaman. And shaman means it was the origin of the word stan.

So that 's why they started to call it like this.

So it 's not that Venus is related with this , it 's just a story. That the names are related , because Venus was doing exactly that to bring the light.

So remember that this beings does n't exist by itself. They are concepts of things that happen in the universe. And we romanized stories to understand what is happening in the skies. Venus from our point of view will be related will be related with this light , because it 's a closest planet that we have.

So besides the sun and the moon , Venus is the one that brings that light to the earth. And it 's related with the water , because it rises in the horizon and the seas in the desert.

So it was related with the hope of life and so on.

So that 's why we put that attribute to the star related to given life , to bring it , bring us the beauty , bring us the light from the sun and so on.

Remember that for us , the humans , we lived in this planet , we lived in this planet because of light. We moved through light. We survived because of the day , because we can see things.

So the group can transcend , can leave because of that , because of the light.

So this is why for us , light is also a synonym of love of all being together. And remember that for the ancient ones , love is related with the ability of seeing the other and to reproduce.

So also remember that Venus is not only the first light or the light of the dawn , but also is fertility , is sexuality.

So it 's important to understand why we relate sexuality with day , because we have to go into the very origin of humans when we were animals , basically. And we needed to reproduce during the day in that time , because otherwise there would be animals , hand in us. And when you reproduce , you lose a lot of energy.

So you are not able to fight or it 's like you are in a low moment , relax moment , let 's say.

So you need it light in order to see what is coming farther , so you can get ready and prepare.

So you do n't get eaten by an animal.

So this is why they related light day with sex and fertility.

So now let 's go into our subconscious and how it was shaped here , the idea of Venus being the love and the desire.

So Venus will be the ability or the need of humans to expand , to reproduce , to generate life.

So Venus is related with this light which is the one that take us from one side to another , the one that pushes and it 's a summary of our whole life since the moment of sex and then the gestation , the moment of birth , the growing , the reproduction and so on. And it summarized the whole concept of life and fertility.

So what we are doing with Venus is to to project the same idea of impulse to create to manifest in life. But in different states of consciousness , so at first would be reproduction and sexuality , but then it starts to change into fertility , into love , into ideas , philosophy and so on.

So are the different types in which we are going to express the pulse of life , the inner fire that moves us.

So remember , if Venus is the one that brings the fire , sorry , if they 're brings the light , this means that Venus is the one that brings the fire to intensify to light the inner potential that we all have within. And this inner fire is what we call usually Kundalini. Is the energy of life that flights and push the transformation of our inner self in lighting our inner power.

So the first fire , the first part of the fire is the physical one which is related with the strength , with the power of activating something. And by this power of action. And then also incranates the sexuality , the reproduction.

So that 's what then becomes in sexuality.

So the fire comes into action. First the action goes into reproduction. The reproduction goes into sexuality and the sexuality evolves into sexuality. And that 's how the fire starts to go up.

So when you go into sexuality , sexuality , remember comes from the word census. That means senses.

So sexuality is not like sexuality which is about the genitals. It 's about the perception of the things. It 's about the five senses and how you perceive the world.

So this is the moment when the desire starts in this fire. The desire is that is willing to receive information through the touch , through the smell , through the mouth , through the eyes and so on. It 's not about sex. It 's about perception.

Look for some people. Food can be sensual , smell can be sensual , music can be sensual.

So that is the sexuality that gives birth to the desire.

So from the solar plexus down , the desire holds the sexuality of senses. The sexual need of reproduction and the action itself.

So once we go out of the solar plexus and we go up to the heart , the passion is the one that starts to activate.

So passion is the wheel of giving of sharing. This the passion is the strength of sharing. Of giving things and below the the desire is the need of having things , of perceived things.

So from the plexus down , is all about the desire to have things for me and from the heart app , we have the passion which is to give from me.

So from this point the fire stops consuming things , making it into ashes and it starts to light and give heat to everyone and light to everyone.

So this is why from the plexus down , so the storm the intestines we feel the need of the need of consuming , we feel the desire of having things. And from the heart app we feel the passion of learning , of sharing , of doing things , of creating things and so on.

So this gives us the idea that this energy moves by polarity. And polarity means that the low we have an energy that is consuming , absorbing energy , and above we have an energy that goes and gives. And remember that the meaning of pulse of polarity in in weak means access. It 's not to different things.

It 's only one thing with two sides. One negative and the other positive. The negative energy below and the positive app is not that the negative is wrong , is that the negative means that it 's absorbing the energy and the one app is expanding the energy.

So the place where all the absorption of energy turns into expansion of energy is in between the solar plexus on the heart. That moment that place is where everything turns in a different direction.

So the energy of Venus is the one inviting us to find balance , access in between the two different fires , the fire that consumes and the fire that expands in ourselves. You can not turn off one of the fires in order for the other one to turn on. You need both of them in order to work in order to create human effects.

So what we have to do is to know how to handle it , how to manage this energy , so it can move properly.

So here we have the two phases of Venus. The two phases where Lucifer and Satan are the same.

So remember that Lucifer is the concept of giving the light and Satan is the concept of absorbing the light and using the matter , consuming the matter.

So now what happened? That usually because we come from monotestic and polytastic traditions , we usually like to blame to divinity , to entities , to demons , to beings , for the things that we do n't know how to handle ourselves.

So now for example , now when I say we light Lucifer , the concept of the word is like turn the light in many of the people that has these subconscious way of thinking that says , oh my god , it 's talking about the devil. Like alert alert.

Sometimes when I start to explain about this and describe all these concepts , people used to to think that I am talking about the demon and the devil and so on , but but it 's not. Basically I 'm speaking about concepts and words that were used to explain these things. But a thousand years ago they started to use it in another way and we are all like this , like brainwashed. There 's no demon as we as we know it in our traditions.

## Daily Practice Elements

Okay? When just parenthesis , when we speak about demons and entities that use us and so on , yes , they are , but they are natural beings from the fourth dimension that they each energy from the living beings and so on , but we can not put into them a statement of organization of hierarchy.

## Practice Structure

Okay? Because this is like trying to to put into cockroaches or some raccoon , I do n't know , the structure of a government when they are trying to eat our garbage.

Okay?

So that 's it.

So the darkness is useful for the universe because they have their own job , we need them for some things. The problem is that some of them go beyond their limits of work and but most of the times is because we do n't know how to handle our own energy so we let them use us.

Okay?

So that 's it.

So now about we following the light or using the matter which is Lucifer , Satan. In our only point of view of life , we do that all the time. When we do that , when instead of following our passions in life , what we do , is to relay all our life to our needs.

So for example , when we know our passion , we know what we want to do , we know where we want to go and we say this is the place , this is the goal and suddenly I say no , but I can not go there because I need to work unless I 'm not going to be able to eat and it to work eight hours a day in this place that I 'd like just because maybe I will die. Or oh , I have this knowledge that I can do it all by myself , I can be free , I have to get out of these relationships and but I do n't know if I 'm going to find someone , maybe I have to be to grab what I found , what I found and just stay here , even if it hurts me. That 's tradition to your own self , that 's Satan.

So regarding Venus , the planet is teaching us that is only ourselves that we are that we are denying and committration , titan to our own self when we live behind our passions in order to just follow our needs. Is our daily betrayal betrayal?

So how can we solve this remembering that our needs are the fuel for our passions? Then we do n't have to eliminate our needs. We need to know how to handle them. Can you know now that we are creating the spirit of Satan every time that we betray our own heart?

So when we know how to handle our needs in order to expand our passions is when we can connect all the energy together and that 's the moment when we call the whole pattern as love. Love is the way in which we call this eternal energy that uses the needs in order to create , to push our passions. And I know that Satan is difficult to understand for some people because it 's so clich the idea of thinking yes but how can I really manifest this just by thinking because I have to work to get stuff and so on and something that most people forget is that to say in this concept is that yes you have to work. You have to do things.

The energy is about movement. If you do n't move , if you do n't do stuff , nothing will happen. It 's not about creation is not about thinking and oh that 's it. Cooperation is about co-creating to do things and then they come back but you have to move.

You have to do things. You have to work. Love is free energy but in order for it to move freely , you have to move.

So it 's not about oh I have to limit it when I do n't like about my job and so on in order to follow my passions. No , it 's about how to put that together to know how your needs are able to fulfill your passions but in order to get there you have to go out of the idea that you need to choose in between one or another.

So these two things are one. This polarity is one , all connected by love and what this means that if I do n't love my needs , I am not going to be able to expand my love in the passions. I have to learn to love what I am here. My work , my sexuality , my way of eating.

I have to learn to love the relationships , the attachments , everything. When I start to know how to love this then I will be able to start to expand the love in my passions. Let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is D.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the balance of the axis. The code for today is West. The last special direction is where everything ends. The ultimate one or destiny.

By the composition , it is the opposite direction to the rotation of the world. And this , it 's what it 's released. Let 's go. Where the stars in the sky disappear.

## Guided Meditation

Sit comfortable close your eyes and start to touch carries stretch your body and young being aware of each part of it and once you did it we focus on our breathing and then we focus on our breathing take a deep breath and then you can see the pain I start to become aware of the body I find myself in the room where I am the house , the building the village or town the country , the continent , the whole planet and take a deep breath as I feel present here and now in my physical body I take a deep breath becoming the room and take a deep breath becoming the house and take a deep breath becoming the town take a deep breath becoming the country becoming the continent I take a deep breath becoming the continent take a deep breath becoming the planet I am the nearest I watch in front of me and I see the sun it 's light and the heat for my body aside perceive the moon spinning around me I watch in front of me Mercury close to the sun Venus and behind Mars Jupiter and Saturn wait far in the horizon you 're on the moon and you 're on the moon and you 're on the moon and you 're on the moon and you 're on the moon wait far in the horizon you 're on the moon Neptune and Pluto I am the solar system take a deep breath and I see the planet Venus in front of me shining reflecting its light reflecting its light spirit I extend my arms towards the planet and then grab it between my hands bringing it to my chest putting it within my heart I am the planet Venus Venus and Jupiter star stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars stars I feel the heat of Venus it 's fire expanding from an art to every direction I feel how this planet expands taking the entire body with its fire with the heat filling myself with love with every breath I am light this fire I have served this fire bringing my lower part all into ashes my feet and legs genitals waste and I recognize there my biggest needs in life what are my biggest desires that are the desires that tired me to the life what needs I am attached to I have served them I become aware of them and I smile to them I smile and then recognize them but they are the tools the energy that I need to run my life I send all my love to them and I see how the lower fire there is my needs and to ashes making them into the fuel of my life take a deep breath I 'll sigh push all this fire towards the upper part of my body through the heart and lightning bringing the heat the light the clarity to my head to my arms and hands and chest I visualize here my passions what are my passions and lives I recognize them as I see that they are the fire the light that impulse me to accomplish my purpose in life I become aware of my passions and I am pulsed and radiated towards the world It 's like this a cyorechopnise that love is the energy that gives balance to my senses I am lost I am lost I am lost I am lost I am lost I am lost I am the balance of the axis.

I am the balance of the axis. I am the balance of the axis. I am love. I know.

Take a deep breath and from the heart bring this consciousness all over the body , crossing , stretching and warning. I need to one at some time come back here in the mouth. Thank you everybody for being there as always. See you tomorrow at the same time.
