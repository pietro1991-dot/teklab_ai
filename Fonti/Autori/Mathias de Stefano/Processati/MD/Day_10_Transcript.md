## Overview

On the tenth day of alignment, we close the first week dedicated to the mind with the toroid chakra. The toroid is shaped like an apple and encompasses every one of the chakras we have worked with during the week. We are in the center of the apple, integrating all the work we have done over the past ten days. Today is a day of reflection, integration, and transcendence.

The vibration "Mh" combines the sound "M" (the portal) with "H" (eternity), creating the portal to the eternal aspect of reality. Today's statement is "I Am the Portal to Eternal," and the code is inhalation in the process of transcendence. This means that the universe breathes again in time, knowing that everything that has meaning in reality never truly existed—it was only a dream. The beauty of everything already lies within itself. We are no longer inspired by forms, colors, or sounds, but by the simple consciousness that everything is a reflection of the "I Am."

This session includes a Q&A section to address questions and clarify concepts from the mental week. We also prepare to transition into the emotional week, which begins tomorrow.

## Core Teaching

### The Toroid: Integration of All Chakras

The toroid is like an apple in shape. It has the form of a three-dimensional ring or doughnut that surrounds our entire energetic field. We are in the center of this toroid, and it contains within it every one of the chakras we have worked with during the mental week—the crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacral, root, knees, and ankles.

Today's task is to integrate all the information, all the concepts, and all the alignments we have experienced during the past ten days. We are not adding new chakras; we are recognizing that everything we have done is held within the toroid shape, and we are at the center of it all.

### The Mind and the Spirit Are One

According to the ancient teachings, the mind and the spirit are not different things—they are the same. The mind creates, and the spirit is the mind itself. Everything we have within is a construction of the spiritual mind. This is why the first week has been dedicated to the mind, focusing on concepts that challenge our intellect and expand our understanding of reality.

The conversations and teachings during this week have been very mental, very conceptual. This is intentional, as we are working with the mind to break patterns, beliefs, and limitations. The goal is to understand the map of reality and to recognize that everything we perceive is a projection of the "I Am."

### Transcendence: Letting Go of the Dream

Today's code teaches us that the universe breathes again in time, knowing that everything that has meaning in reality never truly existed—it was only a dream. This is the essence of transcendence. We have experienced everything, integrated everything, and now we understand that all of it was just a projection, a reflection of our own consciousness.

The beauty of everything already lies within itself. We are no longer inspired by external forms, colors, or sounds. Instead, we are inspired by the simple consciousness that everything is a reflection of the "I Am." This is the highest level of awareness—the recognition that the universe and all its manifestations are projections of one source.

### Addressing Questions and Clarifications

During this session, several questions were addressed to help clarify the teachings of the mental week:

- **Shaking or dizziness during meditation:** This is normal. It is a new energy coming into your body, and your nervous system is trying to adapt to it. The shaking indicates that your body is opening to new perspectives and trying to understand what is happening.

- **Not feeling anything during meditation:** It doesn't matter if you don't feel, see, or perceive anything. What we are doing is working with imagination to align ourselves. Everyone has different perceptions and experiences. Some pay attention to different aspects, just like people at a concert focus on different instruments.

- **Seeing dark spirits or entities:** When you open to other levels of consciousness, the first beings you may perceive are those closer to matter, often perceived as "dark." They are just spirits doing their lives, like we do. We don't need to fear them. Instead, ask yourself: "Why am I feeling this person? What do I have in common with this being?"

- **Negative emotions nourishing the seed:** This is good, not bad. The earth needs these nutrients to nourish the seeds and help them blossom. Just as farms use compost for plants, all emotions—even those we perceive as negative—are useful for nature. We are not getting rid of emotions; we are giving them another meaning and purpose.

- **Feeling tired or exhausted after meditation:** This is normal. Your body is processing new information, and it needs to sleep to assimilate it. If you feel tired, just rest. Don't force yourself to think about why you feel tired. It's simply your body integrating new energy.

- **Not understanding the three spheres:** If your mind doesn't connect the information immediately, don't worry. Just breathe deep, hold it, and exhale everything you don't need. Don't think much about it. We are practicing the exercise of allowing our mind to figure things out without thinking, just perceiving.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit in a comfortable position. Position your body in the most comfortable posture possible.
2. Stretch your body and massage every part of it. Yawn to discharge unnecessary energy.
3. Relax your body, letting all your weight fall down. Feel the weight of your shoulders, arms, and hands falling down.
4. Focus only on your breathing, always through the nose.
5. Become aware of each inhalation and each exhalation. That's all that exists.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Breathe in. With your imagination, bring the oxygen and go with it from the lungs to the heart, through the blood toward every organ, muscle, and even the skin.
2. Take a deep breath and allow yourself to feel your whole body, mostly your skin—all the feelings and sensations you have in your own skin.
3. Try to picture which part of the skin is stretching, which one is itching. Recognize the most extended organ in your body—the skin.
4. Become aware that each tiny part of your skin is the one connecting your whole inner world with the outer world.
5. Take a moment to give thanks and honor your skin for everything it does in order to protect you from the outside and to nourish you.
6. Take a deep breath and recognize the hottest part of your skin and the coldest part of your skin.
7. Recognize that the hottest parts are where the energy of your body is moving, where your emotions flow. The coldest ones are empty.
8. Try to feel how this energy moves through your skin like waves.
9. Try to acknowledge which emotion is surrounding your whole body, every part of yourself, surrounded with the emotion.
10. Don't think much; just allow yourself to feel it. Does this emotion make you feel like a prisoner? Like it is protecting you? Like it's just surrounding you? Or does it make you feel expanded?
11. It's not necessary to put a name on it; just feel it. Breathe the emotion very deep without judgment. Just honor and thank the emotion without judgment. Thanks to the emotion for whatever it is doing for you.
12. Take a deep breath. Without thinking, just allow yourself to perceive the idea that is surrounding you—the idea that reflects what you believe about yourself, or what other people perceive from yourself. This is the idea that is surrounding you, making you who you are. What do you believe of yourself?
13. Recognize the idea. Observe it. No judgment. Breathe the idea in.
14. Realize that these sensations you have in your skin, the emotion that is surrounding you, and the idea that is reflecting yourself are the three tools that your higher self has today to nourish the seed that you are.
15. Take a deep breath. Use your hands or imagination to feel a small sphere surrounding your body that holds the skin. Feel a bigger sphere surrounding your body that holds the emotion that surrounds you. Perceive an even bigger sphere surrounding you that holds the idea of yourself. They are surrounding you in all directions, like layers.
16. Start to allow yourself to perceive the information that relates your skin with the emotion and with the idea of yourself.
17. Recognize that these are the three tools your higher self has today to nourish the seed of the toroid.
18. Become aware of the light of the "I Am" above your head.
19. With very deep breathing, start to descend the light through your crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacrum, root, knees, and ankles, all the way down through your entire body.
20. Observe the light of the "I Am" being absorbed by all the seeds, dissolving the three spheres and starting to nourish the seed of the toroid.
21. Start to activate the vibration of the toroid by pronouncing the sound "Mh."
22. Keep pronouncing the sound as you download the power of the "I Am": "I can, I can, I can integrate everything within me. I can transcend the projection. I can recognize the eternal aspect of my being."
23. Recognize yourself ready to open the portal to the eternal.
24. Affirm repeatedly: "I Am the Portal to Eternal. I Am the Portal to Eternal. I Am Mind. I Am the Portal to Eternal."
25. See and feel all the seeds blossoming together within the toroid, creating a unified field of light and consciousness.
26. Recognize that everything you have experienced during the mental week is integrated within you. All the chakras, all the teachings, all the alignments are now held within the toroid.
27. Take a deep breath and hold it. Just stay inside the experience.
28. Exhale and release all that is not needed. Let go of the forms, colors, and sounds. Recognize that everything is a reflection of the "I Am."

### Closing

1. Caress your body gently, recognizing the integration you have received.
2. Stretch your body and yawn to discharge static energy.
3. Rest and allow yourself to integrate all the information and energy from the mental week.
4. Prepare yourself for the emotional week, which begins tomorrow.

## Q&A

### Q: What is the toroid, and how does it relate to the chakras?

The toroid is shaped like an apple and surrounds our entire energetic field. It contains all the chakras we have worked with during the mental week. We are in the center of the toroid, integrating all the information and alignments.

### Q: Why do I feel shaking or dizziness during meditation?

This is normal. It's a new energy coming into your body, and your nervous system is trying to adapt to it. The shaking indicates that your body is opening to new perspectives and integrating new information.

### Q: What if I don't feel anything during the meditation?

It doesn't matter. What we are doing is working with imagination to align ourselves. Everyone has different perceptions. Some people feel, some see, and some perceive in other ways. Don't worry if you're not experiencing what others are.

### Q: Why am I seeing dark spirits or entities during meditation?

When you open to other levels of consciousness, the first beings you perceive are often those closer to matter, which we perceive as "dark." They are just spirits living their lives. We don't need to fear them. Ask yourself: "What do I have in common with this being?"

### Q: Is it good or bad to nourish the seed with negative emotions?

It's good. The earth needs these nutrients to nourish the seeds and help them blossom. Just as farms use compost for plants, all emotions—even those we perceive as negative—are useful for nature. We are giving them another meaning and purpose.

### Q: Why do I feel tired or exhausted after meditation?

Your body is processing new information, and it needs to sleep to assimilate it. This is like learning during the day and processing it during sleep. If you feel tired, just rest. Don't force yourself to understand why.

### Q: What if I don't understand the connection between the three spheres?

Don't worry. If your mind doesn't connect the information immediately, just breathe deep, hold it, and exhale everything you don't need. We are practicing the exercise of allowing our mind to perceive without thinking too much.

### Q: How do I know if I'm aligned?

If you are feeling changes—emotions, actions, sensations, or thoughts you don't usually experience—that is a clue that you are on the path and working toward alignment. Even if it feels good or bad, change is a sign of progress.
