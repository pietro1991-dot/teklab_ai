**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Ankles
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Spirituality, Religion as GPS, Breathing and Coherence
- **Vibration:** `Pew`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Will that Teaches`
- **Code:** Aries - in our terrestrial sky, the I Am manifests in the constellation of Aries. It was named like that for the period of time where it's positioned with more presence was the time of random sacrifices in the Middle East, so it was named honoring the sacrificed, asking for a good harvest.

## Overview

Speaking from Egypt on the spring/autumn equinox, Matias is exhausted from speaking all day in the sun. His face is red, his voice is thin, but he couldn't miss the daily meeting.

Today is the equinox—an important moment to align with the planet, more important than the new year. It's a moment that starts something new, sowing seeds for a new time.

The topic is spirituality, and Matias cuts through all the preconceptions to reveal the simple truth: spirituality is the ability to breathe calmly in coherence.

## Happy Equinox

### For the Northern Hemisphere

Happy spring equinox—the beginning of new growth, new light, the return of warmth.

### For the Southern Hemisphere

Happy autumn equinox—the beginning of harvest, reflection, the descent into wisdom.

### Planetary Alignment

In this path of consciousness, it's much more important to be aligned with the planet, celebrating the equinoxes and solstices, than celebrating the new year.

It's good to know them, to feel them, to align with the natural cycles of Earth.

## Preconceptions About Spirituality

### What We Think Spirituality Is

Usually, people who live spirituality from within (we are spirituality, we are living in this spirituality) think we've found freedom—we don't feel we belong to any dogma or anything.

But we inherit the conditions of the cultures, the morals, and the traditions of the religions. We use these concepts to build this new spirituality.

Basically, what we do today is create spirituality as something toward freedom, but still with some tools from traditions, cultures, and religions from before.

### How the World Sees Spiritual People

One of the things that happens with preconceived ideas of spirituality is that people looking at spiritual people from the outside see that we are not inside the law of what is normal according to culture.

We've naturalized the idea of religion in culture, but we cannot still naturalize the idea of people living spirituality outside of religion.

Not only is this concept of spirituality seen as following something different, but also for society, those not part of religion or normative culture were called:
- **Sects** - lateral aspects of religion not approved by society
- **Pagans** - those who follow other traditions not accepted by the rest

As a summary, the world sees spiritual people as those who are not following the rules—weird people.

### We Still Keep Religious Ideas

From our point of view as spiritual people, even though we want to go outside formality, we still keep having the ideas, the essence of religion.

## The True Meaning of Spirituality

### Spirituality = The Ability to Breathe

To understand where all this comes from, let's understand what it means to be spiritual.

**Spirituality means the quality or the ability to breathe.**

That's what it means.

### Who Is a Spiritual Person?

The one who has the ability to breathe harmonically:
- Not being in a rush
- Breathing in, breathing out
- Calm
- Never stressed
- Being in the center

The person who is breathing properly is because they don't have nothing to hide. They face darkness.

So they can breathe properly, free, because whatever that person thinks, feels, and does is coherent.

**Spirituality is the ability to breathe in calm.**

### What Spirituality Is NOT

Usually we have this mistake with the concept of spirituality.

Spirituality is NOT:
- To connect with beings in other dimensions
- To connect with spirits
- To study many philosophies
- To do citations and meditations

That's not spirituality. Spirituality is easy.

**Spirituality is to know how to breathe and to stay calm in oneself.**

### Beyond Dogma and Religion

The spirituality is not related to:
- A dogma
- A religion
- Any kind of tradition or philosophy

Spirituality is about living calm, coherent, and quiet in harmony.

## How Spirituality Became Complicated

### Humans Evolved to Survive

When we say spirituality is about breathing and being calm, this is completely different and complicated from how it started for us in humanity.

Humans came from mammals that were trying to survive. We evolved thousands of years on this planet trying to survive in the middle of a hostile environment.

Because of this, we've been trying to look for ways to survive—for example, taking care of the herd and protecting others.

As many together (the clan, the group), so much more chances to survive.

### Religion: Being Tied Together

To be all tied up and connected, all together, in Latin you say **Re-ligare**, which is the origin of religion.

**Religion means to be all tied up, to be all together, so we can take care of one another.**

Through thousands of years, religions were used as a way to survive. They were created by the cultures, philosophies, ideas, and morals of different humans.

They created this religion to tie all of them together in order to protect the population, the clan, and ensure the safety of each individual.

### Religion as Security

Most people trying to protect themselves and survive in groups used religion as a way to keep all the population safe and secure.

Religion was something that gave security to people so they could know where to go, what was the destiny, so they felt safe.

### Spirituality Within Religion

Inside the religions, there is also spirituality.

Spirituality is when, inside of this safety, you start to find yourself in balance, connected to the divine, and you find the calm.

So the religion, as you see now, was not something bad for humanity. The religions were really useful because people needed religions in order not to get lost, so they could keep going, moving, not being confused by all the different things and attacked by all the things outside.

## Religion as GPS

### The Perfect Metaphor

We can relate religion today to a GPS.

When you put a GPS, you put a destination, and there's a voice that shows you the path and says:
- "Turn left"
- "Turn right"
- "Keep going, in three kilometers..."
- "Your destination is ahead, 15 minutes"

You have this GPS, and instead of going lost through the mountains going around, not knowing where you go, you just have this path to follow. And that's perfect.

That would be like the expression of a religion.

### When the GPS Starts to Bother

There is a moment when I start to realize that the destiny is not as important as I thought. I start to feel more safe within myself.

I start to say: "Maybe I can try something different, find different paths, enjoy the view."

In that moment, the GPS starts to bother a little bit.

### The GPS Tries to Bring You Back

When you start to go into different paths and find different ways of your life, trying to enjoy the view, you've noticed that when you put your GPS and decide to take another path from the original, the GPS is constantly trying to bring you back to the same direction, to the main path it was saying.

Suddenly you're taking another road with a different view, but the GPS is trying to take you back.

### The Inner GPS

What happens is you start to feel free to seek other things, to expand your path, your route. But there is something inside that brings you to the same cultures, the same traditions, the same religion.

This is the moment when you start to picture that spirituality is related with archangels, beings, spirits, and so on. But it's not.

Basically, when you go into the mountains traveling, opening yourself to different things, going to Nordic traditions to see the ruins and all this, suddenly the GPS is saying: "Archangel Michael, Archangel Lucifer..."

We start to go through this new path but still believing or having these concepts of archangels or beings from other religions.

---

## Having a Religion in Spirituality Is Okay

### Nothing Wrong With It

There's nothing wrong with having a path of religion and keeping the traditions of religion in spirituality.

Basically, the religion that your inner GPS is following is because that was the tradition that all your family and culture were working with.

When you open yourself to go into a different path, having that GPS of religion inside helps you not get lost even if you decide to play and see what's around.

It's okay. There's no problem with that. It's just a different way and feeling secure at the same time.

### Some People Turn Off the GPS

Of course, there are people who say, "I don't want anything with religion." So they turn off the GPS and get lost a few days in the mountains.

## Spirituality as Ocean, Religions as Fish

### The Ocean Metaphor

What we have to acknowledge about this is that **spirituality is like an ocean**—a huge ocean.

And **religions are like fish inside the ocean**.

### Tools for Swimming

When we become spiritual beings, we start to understand that religions are only ways, tools, to know how to swim in that ocean.

That's why we have so many fish. Each one of the fish is designed to use the ocean, to swim in the ocean, to dive in the ocean in different ways.

Imagine a huge ocean with only one species of fish. It's horrible. We need many in order to understand the beauty of this.

### No One Best Fish

Imagine that the conflict we have is believing that there is only one fish that is the best at swimming. But no, no, there is no one best.

Each one has evolved to take benefit of the waves, of the currents, in its own way.

### Religions as Tools, Not the Source

The religions are not the ones that allow spirituality. It's the opposite.

Spirituality uses the religions as tools.

The religions are only tools that show you how to arrive at one spot, one destiny. But there are many paths, many ways to reach that destiny.

---

## Freedom to Choose

### You Are Free to Choose Your Path

You are free to choose which path you take. Nobody can force you to choose one path. It isn't possible.

In history, we have been forced to be in religions, but it doesn't mean we accepted them.

We can be forced to be in a religion, but it doesn't mean we accept it within. If you accept that religion by being forced, it's because you allowed it. Nobody obligated you. It's your own decision.

To take a path is your own decision. Nobody can force you to that.

### All Paths Lead to the Same Place

Every path, every religion, goes to exactly the same spot, which is **love and unity**.

All of them. They go exactly to the same spot in different ways, but they go to that.

So it doesn't matter which one you take.

---

## Coherence: The Core of Spirituality

### The Only Important Thing

Another way of seeing it is that when you become spiritual, you understand that the only important thing is that you are **coherent with what you think, what you feel, and what you do**.

That's the most important thing.

The rest—the philosophy you take, the religion, the dogma you take—is like clothes.

### Matias and Changing Clothes

For example, I am Matias, and I will change my clothes. Sometimes I will wear black. Other times I'll wear white. I don't care. I change the colors, but I will always be Matias changing clothes.

The difference is when you allow the mode, the fashion, to determine your personality.

But if you know who you are, you can use whatever you want, and fashion will never determine who you are.

### Going Everywhere

I myself can go to:
- A mosque
- A church
- A synagogue
- A shamanic ceremony

I don't care. I will do as it's supposed to be done, as the people are doing and feeling, and I will do the same. I will feel the same, because it's spirituality.

Those are just ways of spirituality.

---

## When You Realize You Are the Ocean

### You Don't Judge the Fish

When you realize that you are the ocean, you don't really judge the fish in the ocean.

### Spirituality Is Not About Belief

Spirituality is not about to believe. Spirituality is about **to be**.

### Don't Become a New Dogma

Sometimes we start to fight so much against the dogma and religions that we start to become one.

### The Only Important Thing

Remember, it doesn't matter what you believe.

The real important thing is that you be coherent with what you believe.

## Practice

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on breathing.

Take a deep breath, feeling how with each inhalation, your body expands a bit more. Feel the energy moving around your body, going into every part of it—the heat and the cold, waves of energy that move through.

Take a deep breath. Recognize this energy as your emotions. Perceive all these emotions inside your body, in each part of it.

Take a deep breath. They expand in your body and dissolve to the infinite, like drops of water filling up an entire ocean.

Take a deep breath and perceive in this ocean the darkness, the religions, the beliefs, and the paths that you know have affected your life.

Observing these emotions, watch every path you know toward unity, toward God.

See with your imagination how all these paths lead to the same point—the unity, the I Am.

Each one of these paths is a mastery, a teaching, that leads you to the only one divine, the I Am.

Recognize that all your beliefs are useful for you. The beliefs of others are their own tools.

See how all these paths are, all of them, spirituality.

Inspire. And from you, respond, connecting all the paths as one.

Feel the calm between what you think, feel, and do.

Sound the vibration **Pew** from your ankles.

**I am the will that teaches. I am the will that teaches.**

**I believe.**

**Because I am.**

## Integration

Today, on the equinox, examine your relationship with religion and spirituality.

Are you fighting against old dogmas so much that you've created a new dogma? Are you using religions as tools while knowing you are the ocean, not just one fish?

Practice coherence: Align what you think, what you feel, and what you do. When these three are in harmony, you breathe calmly. That's spirituality.

Choose your path freely. Use the GPS when you need direction. Turn it off when you want to explore. But know that all paths lead to love and unity.

---

## Week Context

We are in the Physical Week of Pisces, learning how the body relates to spiritual concepts.

The ankles (today's chakra) are where we flex and adapt, where we maintain balance while moving. They represent the ability to walk any path while staying grounded.

Today is the equinox—balance between light and dark, day and night, structure and flow. The perfect day to recognize that all paths (religions) lead to the same destination (spirituality).

## Q&A

### Q: If I don't follow a religion, am I still spiritual?

Spirituality is breathing calmly in coherence, not following a religion. Religion is a tool, not the requirement. If you're coherent and calm, you're spiritual, regardless of religious affiliation.

### Q: Can I mix different religions in my practice?

Yes, if you realize you are the ocean, not just one fish. You can use different tools (religions) to swim in the ocean (spirituality). Just stay coherent with yourself.

### Q: What if my religion brings me anxiety instead of calm?

Then it's not serving its purpose. Religion should provide security and direction. If it brings anxiety, either you're using it incorrectly or it's not the right tool for you. Find a path that allows you to breathe calmly.

### Q: How do I know if I'm being coherent?

Check if what you think, feel, and do align. If you think one thing, feel another, and do a third—you're incoherent. This creates inner conflict and prevents calm breathing.

### Q: Is it wrong to keep some religious traditions while exploring spirituality?

No, it's natural. Your inner GPS (cultural conditioning) keeps those traditions. It's okay—they can provide security while you explore. Just don't let them limit your exploration.

### Q: What if I get lost without the GPS (religion)?

Then you'll wander a bit, explore, and eventually find your way. Some people need the GPS. Others prefer to explore. Both are valid. The key is choosing consciously, not following blindly or rebelling blindly.
