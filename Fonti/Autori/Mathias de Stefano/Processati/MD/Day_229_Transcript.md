## Introduction

So , hi everyone. What a way to start this by saying , which is very thin , but really I was speaking the whole day in front of the sun , I did n't notice. That 's why I have my lips and my face like red and I 'm really headache.

So that 's why I decided to be alone today to be quiet. Not much movement because I needed to be too rest a little bit.

So besides this situation , like I find myself today , I could n't miss our daily meeting.

So here I am.

So I will try to be even much more to the point today. I guess that in the post for today , I explained most of the things that I would explain today.

So I would recommend for you to read the post and if you want to know better what I am not going to be able to explain as deep as I explain today.

So first of all , before we start , happy equinox for all of you. Happy equinox for the people that is in the north and hemisphere , happy spring equinox. And for the people that is in the southern hemisphere , happy autumn equinox.

So in this path of consciousness , remember that it 's going to be much more important to be aligned with the planet celebrating the equinox on the southeast than the new year.

So it 's good to know them , to know the equinox on the southeast.

So I wanted to start by saying this about the topic for today , which is spirituality. Then we are in the group , sorry , we are in the path of spirituality. And there are many preconceptions about what is spirituality. Usually what happened with the people that leave this brutality from within , like we are spirituality.

We are living in this spirituality. What we usually do is that we found the freedom that we do n't feel to belong to any dogma or anything. But we inherit the conditions of the cultures , the moral and the traditions of the religions. And we kind of use this concept , kind of use this concept to build this new spirituality.

So basically why we do today is that the spirituality is something created towards the freedom. But still with some tools from traditions , cultures and religions from before.

So one of the things that happened in the preconceived ideas of spirituality is that the people that look into the spiritual people from the outside , they see that they are not inside the law of what is normal , of what is normal according to the culture. Because we naturalized the idea of religion in the culture , but we can not still naturalized the idea of people that live still the spirituality , but from the outside of the religion.

So not only this concept of spirituality would be like they are following something different , but also for the society who was not part of our religion , about part of the normative , they usually were called sects , the sects and the cults are like lateral aspects of a religion that they are not approved by the entire society. And also they were the used to call them pigments. Pigments are the ones that follow other traditions that are not accepted by the rest.

So because they have other different ways of seeing things. As a summary , the world see the spiritual people as those who are not following the rules.

## Guided Meditation

So they are like these weird people. Or but from our point of view , from the spiritual people , even though we want to go outside from that formality , we still keep having the ideas , the essence of the religious , the religion. To understand from where all this comes from , let 's go again to understand what what it means to be spiritual. Spirituality means the quality , or the ability to breathe.

That 's what it means.

So who is a spiritual person? The one that has the ability to breathe harmonically , not being in a rush , breathing in , breathing out , calm , never stress , being in the center and the person that is breathing properly is because it does n't have nothing to hide. It faces darkness.

So it can breathe properly , free because whatever that person thinks feels and do is coherent.

So spirituality is the ability to breathe in calm.

So usually we have this mistake with the concept of spirituality. Spirituality is not to connect with beings and other dimensions to connect with spirits to , you know , to study about many philosophies and do at citations and meditation. That 's not spirituality. Spirituality is easy.

Spirituality is to know how to breathe and to stay calm in oneself.

So the spirituality is not related to a dogma , not related to a religion , not related to any kind of tradition or philosophy. Spirituality is about leave calm , coherent and quiet in harmony.

So of course that now when we say that spirituality is about breathing and being calm , is completely different and complicated from how it started for us in humanity. Because as I always explain humans were coming from the mammals that we 're trying to survive. We have evolved thousands of years in this planet trying to survive in the middle of a hostile environment. Because of this we have been trying to look for ways to survive.

Like for example taking care of the herd and protecting the others.

So as many together the clan , the group together , so much more chances to survive.

So to be all tied up and connected , all once and again , in Latin you may say , Ré Figure , which is the origin of religion. Religion means to be all tied up to be all together.

So we can take care one another. Through thousands of years , the religions were used as a way to survive. They were created by the cultures , the philosophies , the ideas , the morals of the different humans. And they created this religion to tied all of them in order to protect the population , the clan.

So they would ensure the safety of each one of the individuals. Most of the people that we 're trying to protect themselves to try to survive in this groups , they used the religion as a way to keep all the population safe and secure.

So the religion was kind of something that gave security to the people so they could know where to go , where to what was the destiny so they fell safe. Inside the religions , there is also spirituality. The spirituality is when , inside of this safety , you start to find yourself in balance connected to the divine and you find the cow.

So the religion , as you see now , was not something bad for humanity. The religions were something really useful because the people need religions in order to not to get lost so they could keep going , moving and not being confused by all the different things and attacked by all of the different things that are outside.

So the religions were really useful for the people that needed safety in the park. We can relate today the religion with the PS.

So when you put a PS , you put a destiny and there 's a voice that shows you the path and says turn left , out and right , keep going in three kilometers. Your destination is ahead 15 minutes. I do n't know.

So you have this kind of PS and instead of going lost through the mountains going around , not knowing where you go , you just have this path to follow and that 's perfect.

So that would be like the compression of a religion.

So there is a moment when I start to realize that the destiny is not such important as I thought , I start to feel more safe within myself.

So you start to say maybe I can see something different , to find different paths , enjoy the view and so on.

So in that moment the PS starts to bother a little bit.

So of course that , of course that when you start to go into different paths and figure different ways of your life trying to enjoy the view and so on , for sure you have noticed that when you put your PS and you decide to take another path from the original one , the PS is constantly trying to bring you back to the same direction , to the same to the main path that it was saying to you.

So suddenly you are doing another road with a different view but the PS is trying to take you back.

So what happened is that you start to feel free to seek for another things to expand your path , your route but there is something inside that brings you to the same cultures , the same traditions , religion and this is the moment when you start to picture that spirituality is related with archangels and beings and spirits and so on. But it 's not because basically when you go into the mountains , traveling , opening yourself to different things and I do n't know , going to the Nordic tradition to see the ruins and all this and suddenly the PS is saying to you , they are candle , Michael , they 're candle , Lucifer and so on.

So we start to to go through this new path but still believing or having this concepts of archangels or or beings from other religions , from other religions.

So there 's nothing wrong with having a path of a religion and keeping the traditions of a religion in spirituality. There 's nothing wrong with this.

So basically because the religion that maybe your inside your inner PS is following is because that was the tradition that all your family and all the culture were working with. When you open yourself to go into a different path , having that PS of religion inside helps you to not get lost even if you decide to play and see what is about. What is about around?

So it 's okay , there 's no problem with that. It 's just a different way and feel it secure at the same time. Of course , there are people that say I do n't want nothing with religion , so they turn off the PS and they get lost a few days in the mountains.

So now what we have to acknowledge about this is that spirituality is like an ocean , spirituality is like a huge ocean and religions are like fishes inside the ocean.

So when we become spiritual beings , we start to understand that religions are only ways tools to know how to swim in that ocean.

So that 's why we have so many fishes. Each one of the fishes are designed to use the ocean to swim in the ocean , to dive in the ocean in different ways. Imagine a huge ocean is like we have with only one species of fishes. It 's horrible.

We need many in order to understand the beauty of this.

So imagine that the conflict that we have is believing that there is only one fish that is the best on swimming and no , no , there is no one best. Each one has evolved to take benefit of the waves , of the currents and its own way.

So the religions are not the ones that allow the spirituality. It 's the opposite. The spirituality used the religions as tools. The religions as I said , there are only tools that shows you how to arrive to one spot , to one destiny , but there are many paths , many ways to reach that destiny.

So you are free to choose which path you take. Nobody can force you to choose one path. Is n't possible. In history we have been forced to be on the religions , but it does n't mean that we can accept them.

We can be forced to be in a religion , but it does n't mean that we accept it with them.

So if you accept that religion by being forced , is because you allow it. Nobody obligated you. Is your own decision.

So to take a path is your own decision. Nobody can force you to that. Every path every religion goes exactly the same spot , which is love and unity. All of them.

They go exactly the same spot in different ways , but they go to that.

So it does n't matter which one you take.

So another way of seeing it , is that when you become spiritual , you understand that the only important thing is that you are coherent with what you think , what you feel and what you do. That 's the most important thing. The rest , the philosophy you take , the religion , the dogma you take , is like the clothes.

So for example , I am Matthias and I will change my clothes.

Sometimes I will wear what black , at the times where white. I do n't care. I change the colors , but I will be always Matthias changing clothes. The difference is when you allow the mode , the fashion , when you allow the fashion to determine your personality.

But if you know who you are , you can use whatever you want , and fashion will never determine who you are.

## Q&A

So this is why you can go to me myself. I can go to a mask to a church to synagogue. I do n't care , to a chimantics ceremony. I will do as it is supposed to do , as the people are doing and feeling and I will do the same.

I will feel the same , because it 's spirituality. Those are just ways of spirituality. When you realize that you are the ocean , the ocean , the ocean , you do n't really judge the fishes on the ocean. Spirituality is not about to believe , spirituality is about to be.

Sometimes we start to fight so much against the dogma and religions that we start to become one.

So remember , it does n't matter in what you believe. The real important thing is that you to be coherent with what you believe. Let 's go to the alignment. The vibration for today is Pew.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the will that teaches. The goal for today is areas. In our terrestrial sky , the I am manifest in the constellation of areas. It was named like that for in the period of time where it 's positioned with more presence was the time of the random sacrifices in the Middle East.

## Q&A

For it was named honoring the sacrificed , asking for a good harvest. It is the beginner , the potency , the spark of fire , the first house of the sky that is based on oneself and is supplying the basic necessities on the physical body. Sit comfortably. Close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing.

I take a deep breath , feeling how to each inhalation , my body expands a bit more. I feel the energy moving around my body going into every part of it. The heat and the cold waves of energy that moves through. Do n't worry about your cold heat and with the enthusiasm that the item I use it of high speed is too heavy to float , I love it with the internationale colors.

If otherwise the heat meets comfort , no difference from the yellow they go back to nutrition they tend to give We take it a breath , recognize this energy as my emotions , and I perceive all these emotions inside my body , in each part of it , and the side breath , they expand , expand in my body , and dissolve in it to the infinite , like drops of water , filling up an entire ocean. They take it a breath , and perceive in this ocean the darkness , the religion , the beliefs and the losses that I know that had affected my life , and those that I observe emotions , I have watching every path that I know towards the unity , towards God. And I see with my imagination how all this path had to the sucked same point , the unity , each one of this path is a mastery , a teaching , that leads me to the only one divine , the I am. I recognize that all my beliefs are useful for me , the beliefs of others are their own tools.

I see how all this path are all of them , the spirituality , and I inspire. And for me I respond , connecting all the path as one. I feel the calm in between what I think , feel and do. I am the real , the teachers , I am the real , the teachers , I believe.

Because I am. Thank you everybody for being here , so always , and remember that tomorrow at 5am , we will be in the three pyramids connected , connecting with a hundred and forty-four. See you tomorrow , as always , at the same time.
