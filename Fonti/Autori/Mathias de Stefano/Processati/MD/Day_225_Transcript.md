## Overview

Today, **Day 225**, we arrive at the **solar plexus chakra** of the Emotional Week of Pisces.

Our topic is **to be**—the most fundamental verb in all languages, the one that defines our very existence.

Yesterday we spoke about **unconditional love** as accepting the world and people as they are while still working to transform them. Today we clarify this teaching further:

**Accepting the world "as is" does not mean doing nothing.**

It means understanding that **you cannot build a better future by hating the present**.

---

## The Baby Metaphor Continued

### Loving the Baby as a Baby

Yesterday we used the metaphor of humanity as a **baby learning to communicate**.

Today we expand this: when you have a baby, you **love the baby as a baby**.

You accept that right now, the baby cries, needs constant care, doesn't understand limits.

But you don't say: "I will only love you when you become a conscious adult."

You love the baby **now**, in its baby state, **while also teaching it** to become a conscious adult.

### Not Hating the Present

The same is true for the world.

You cannot work for a better world by **hating the world as it is now**.

You cannot transform humanity by **rejecting humanity's current state**.

### The Balance

The balance is:
- **Accept** the present reality (humanity is learning, struggling, growing)
- **Work** to transform that reality (teach, guide, create new systems)
- **Don't waste energy** hating what is (this only depletes you)

---

## Forgiveness and Understanding

### "Forgive Them, They Know Not What They Do"

This famous phrase from Jesus is about **understanding process**.

Humanity is **learning**. Most people don't consciously choose to cause harm—they are operating from:
- Unconscious patterns
- Survival fears
- Limited understanding
- Inherited trauma

**"They know not what they do"** means: they are unconscious. They are babies crying because they don't yet know how to speak.

### This Doesn't Mean Inaction

Forgiving doesn't mean **allowing harm to continue**.

It means:
- Understanding the **source** of the behavior (unconsciousness)
- Setting **boundaries** to prevent harm
- **Teaching** better ways while accepting the current state
- Not wasting energy on **hatred** or **judgment**

---

## Conscious Parenting Applied to the World

### Teaching Limits with Love

A conscious parent doesn't say to the child: "You're bad because you hit your brother."

A conscious parent says: "**You cannot hit your brother. I will teach you why. Here are the limits.**"

And they do this **with love**, not rejection.

### Applied to Humanity

The same principle applies to how we relate to the world:
- Don't reject humanity for being "bad"
- Set boundaries where harm is occurring
- Teach and model better ways
- Help people discover their potentialities

### The Goal Is Not Perfection

The goal is not to **make everyone perfect**.

The goal is to **help everyone become more conscious**—to evolve from baby to child to adolescent to adult in their awareness.

And this process **never ends**. There is always more to learn, more to transform.

## The Etymology of "To Be"

### The Most Ancient Verb

**"To be"** is considered the **most ancient verb** in human language.

Every language has some form of this verb because it defines the most fundamental reality: **I exist**.

### European Root: "Bhu"

In most European languages, "to be" comes from the root **"bhu"**—which means **to exist**.

From this root we get:
- English: **be**
- Spanish: **ser**
- French: **être**
- Italian: **essere**

All pointing to the same core idea: **existence itself**.

### Latin: "Ex-sistere"

But there's another layer. The Latin word for existence is **"ex-sistere"**:
- **Ex** = outside, out from
- **Sistere** = to stay, to stand

**Existence means "to stay outside"**—to stand outside of the source, to manifest as separate.

---

## Universe, Diversity, and Verse

### Universe: Unity Going Outside

Now we can understand deeper meanings.

**Universe** comes from:
- **Uni** = one, unity
- **Verse** = to turn, to return

**Universe** means: **the unity that turns**—the one that goes outside itself (exists) and then **returns back** to itself.

### Diversity: Two Paths

**Diversity** comes from:
- **Di** = two
- **Verse** = to turn, version

**Diversity** means: **two paths, two versions**.

It's the idea that the one (universe) **splits into two** to create all the versions of itself—all the diversity of existence.

### The Movement: Out and Back

The universe is a **constant movement**:
1. **Out**: Unity becomes diversity (ex-sistere, existing outside)
2. **Back**: Diversity returns to unity (verse, the return)

This is the eternal cycle: **separation and integration**.

---

## Integration vs. Separation

### Two Perspectives

There are two ways to see reality:
1. **Separation**: I am separate from everything else
2. **Integration**: I am part of everything else

### Consciousness Is the Difference

The difference between these perspectives is **consciousness**.

**Unconscious**: I am separate, I must defend myself, I must fight to survive.

**Conscious**: I am connected, I am part of the whole, my wellbeing is connected to all wellbeing.

### Both Are True

Both perspectives are **true**:
- Yes, you are a **separate individual** (diversity, existing outside)
- Yes, you are **part of the whole** (unity, returning to source)

The work is to **hold both truths** simultaneously.

---

## Space and Time: The Two Constants

### Two Constants of Reality

In all of existence, there are **two constants**:
1. **Space**
2. **Time**

Everything else changes, but these two remain.

### The Vibrational Wave

When these two constants **cross**—when space and time intersect—they create a **vibrational wave**.

This wave is what we call **matter**, **energy**, **existence**.

### Each "I Am" Is a Position

Every **"I Am"**—every individual existence—is a **different position** in space and time.

You are here, in this moment. Someone else is there, in that moment.

**Different positions, but all the same being**—all waves in the same ocean, all notes in the same song.

## To Be or Not To Be

### Shakespeare's Question

"To be or not to be"—this famous question is often understood as: **Should I live or die?**

But it's deeper than that.

### A Choice of Vibration

**"To be"** is a **choice of vibration**.

It's not determined by your circumstances. It's determined by **how you choose to vibrate**—what frequency you choose to embody.

### Not Determined by Outside

Your **being** is not determined by:
- What others think of you
- What job you have
- What relationships you're in
- What you own

Your being is determined by **your choice**: How will I vibrate? What frequency will I embody?

### Essence: Quality of Being

This is what we call **essence**—the **quality of your being**.

Not what you have or do, but **how you exist**.

And essence is recognizing: **everything is myself in different processes**.

---

## Everything Is Yourself in Different Processes

### The Core Teaching

This is the core teaching of today:

Every being you encounter is **yourself in a different process**.

- The baby crying: you, learning to communicate
- The person causing harm: you, learning consciousness
- The enlightened master: you, having integrated wisdom

**All versions of the same I Am.**

### Not "The Same" But "Connected"

This doesn't mean everyone is literally the same person.

It means: **we are all expressions of the same source**, at different points in the journey of returning.

We are all waves in the same ocean, each with a different shape, but all made of the same water.

### Recognizing Yourself Everywhere

When you see someone struggling, you are seeing **yourself struggling** at a different point in time.

When you see someone succeeding, you are seeing **yourself succeeding** at a different point in time.

**All reflections of the same I Am.**

---

## You Cannot Hate the Present While Building the Future

### The Paradox

Here's the paradox people struggle with:

"If I accept the world as it is, how can I work to change it? Don't I need to reject what's wrong in order to fix it?"

### The Answer

No. **Rejection drains your energy. Acceptance gives you energy to transform.**

Think of the baby again:
- If you **hate** the baby for crying, you'll be too angry and exhausted to teach.
- If you **accept** the baby's current state, you can calmly, lovingly guide them to better communication.

### Applied to the World

The same is true for the world:
- If you **hate** the world for its violence, injustice, suffering, you'll burn out.
- If you **accept** that the world is in process (learning, evolving), you can work for transformation without depleting yourself.

### Love the Present, Build the Future

**Love the baby now. Teach the baby to become a conscious adult.**

**Love the world now. Work to help the world become more conscious.**

These are not contradictions. They are the same act.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Breathe deeply.

Feel the energy in your solar plexus—the center of your personal power, your identity.

### Perceiving the Emotional Network

Become aware that you are not isolated.

Your emotions, your energy, your being—all are part of a **network** that connects you to everything else.

### Seeing All as Reflections

Now, bring to mind different people:
- Someone you love
- Someone you struggle with
- Someone you admire
- Someone you judge

For each person, recognize: **This is me. This is a reflection of myself.**

Not that they are literally you. But that they are showing you **something about yourself**—a quality you have, a lesson you need, a version of you at a different stage.

### Accepting the Process

See all these reflections as **processes**.

Each person is in their own journey of:
- Existing outside (diversity, separation)
- Returning to source (unity, integration)

**Accept this.** Don't judge. Don't reject. Just see.

### Sound the Vibration

From your solar plexus, sound the vibration **Pure**.

**I am the will that connects. I am the will that connects.**

**To see. To see. To see.**

### Integration

Breathe deeply. Feel this recognition expanding through your entire being.

You are connected to everything. Everything is a reflection of you. All is the same I Am in different processes.

### Closing

Bring your awareness back to the room. Open your eyes when you're ready.

## Integration

### Daily Recognition

Today, practice seeing **reflections of yourself** in everyone you encounter.

When someone frustrates you, ask: "What part of me is this reflecting?"

When someone inspires you, ask: "What potential in me is this showing?"

### The Present-Future Balance

Notice when you fall into **hating the present** while trying to build the future.

Pause and remember: **You can only transform what you accept.**

Love the world as it is (like loving the baby). Work to help it evolve (like teaching the baby to speak).

### The "I Am" Constant

Throughout the day, return to the simple awareness: **I Am**.

Not "I am this" or "I am that." Just: **I Am.**

This is your constant, beyond all changes, beyond all circumstances.

---

## Week Context

We are completing the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where we've learned:
- **Void** (empathy with all)
- **Utopia** (living the ideal now)
- **Surrender** (saving energy for the right moment)
- **Unconditional Love** (accepting the eternal process)
- **To Be** (the constant I Am through all changes)

Pisces teaches us: **everything is connected**. We are all reflections of each other. We are all the same I Am, existing in different positions of space and time.

Next month, we enter **Aries**—where we will use all this understanding to **begin the battle**, to actively create the new world.

But we can only do this effectively if we **accept the present** while working to transform it.

## Q&A

### Q: How can I accept the world as it is when there's so much suffering?

Accepting the world doesn't mean **approving** of suffering. It means understanding that suffering is part of the **learning process** humanity is in. From this acceptance, you can work to reduce suffering without burning out from hatred and despair.

### Q: If everyone is a reflection of me, does that mean I'm responsible for their actions?

No. It means you're responsible for **what they reflect in you**. If someone's cruelty triggers you, that's showing you something about **your relationship with cruelty** (perhaps your fear of it, your judgment of it, your own capacity for it). You're not responsible for their choices, but you are responsible for your responses.

### Q: What does it mean that "to be" is a choice of vibration?

It means your **essence**—your quality of being—is not determined by external circumstances. You choose **how you respond**, what frequency you embody. Two people in the same situation can choose very different vibrations (fear vs. love, contraction vs. expansion).

### Q: How do I see someone as a "reflection of myself" when they're completely different from me?

They're showing you **a possibility**, not necessarily your current state. A cruel person shows you the potential for cruelty (which all humans have). A kind person shows you the potential for kindness (which you also have). All humans contain all potentials—we just express different ones.

### Q: How does the universe "return to itself"?

Through **consciousness**. As we become more aware, we recognize that we're not separate—we're all part of the unity. This recognition is the "return" (verse). We never actually left; we just forgot. Remembering is the return.

### Q: What's the practical difference between hating the present and accepting it?

**Hating** the present: "This world is terrible, I can't stand it, why is everyone so unconscious?" (Result: burnout, despair, ineffective action)

**Accepting** the present: "The world is learning, I see the unconsciousness, I will work to bring more consciousness." (Result: sustained energy, compassion, effective action)

### Q: How do I practice this teaching when someone harms me?

Set boundaries. Protect yourself. Remove yourself from harm. **AND** recognize that the person is unconscious, learning, in process. You can accept their **process** (they are a baby who doesn't know how to communicate yet) without accepting their **behavior** (you don't let the baby hit you repeatedly).
