## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good evening , good afternoon , good evening to all of you , whatever you are. I 'm always thank you for being another day here.

So remember that today is 22nd , May 22nd , so today we made the change of our month.

## Q&A

Remember , for those who are following the task of the Mercado , every month since February I guess , 22nd , we started to make for a month the intention before we go to sleep. Of saying , I am , I am , and then an attribute of the Mercado. We are activating the attributes of the Mercado.

So every month we change the date to any second.

So we are preparing ourselves to create between all together , all of us one , this huge Mercado for our task in August 22nd , which will be our first connection altogether in doing tasks , applied tasks.

So today we change the concept which is I am formed.

So just to think about it before we go to sleep or just say it , it 's not much for this next month and the next. For that the attributes of the Mercado are related to the first three that we set this past three months , which was of wisdom and will. And for this next three months we will work with the other training team , which is like and form.

So for this month it will be form and form is basically all the forms that we are. We have the form of a human.

So just by saying I am formed is one of the attributes of what we are.

Today it 's getting complicated even for me. I 'm learning to.

So today we have to talk about the end-of-kind system. For sure this system , the end-of-kind system is the one that you have the most in the spiritual world. There are all of you know about the end-of-kind system because it 's the one that has the glance and we know the glance because we know the glance because there are the bodyments of the charts.

So in the spiritual world we all the time say about the charts and the seventh charts and how to align the charts and usually we mention the glance in which they are encoded.

Okay? The charts are leaving an extent in this glance. But for sure many of us had no idea what are their families where they really are in our body and how they work for us and our life.

So let 's go into this.

So I would recommend you to watch the previous video for me yesterday to where I speak about the spiritual idea , the world of ideas , the intangible reality manifest itself through the organs into the world of attributes.

So from the ethereal to the physical , the organs kind of the prisons that allow this information to be manifested here.

So I spoke about that yesterday and today we are going to see it a little bit more related to a prism , like a crystal where a white ray of light comes through and this prism divides itself into different frequencies to each in the colors or making the perception of colors.

So this is the birth of the charts as we know them.

So let 's look into this. As an example to understand how the colors appears , remember like this here , you have like this bottle of water. And if I show you the image here , you will see that there is like kind of weird images , like my fingers point in every direction or my hand is appear , you see it 's like weird. And happens this.

This happens because the light , the photon particles , go through all the things like here , the go through this space. But what really happened is that it finds like something like water or crystal , the light can not go through properly because the particles are the particles that shape the water or the crystal , they may reflect the particles of light.

So the photons kind of keeps the walls of the water and it starts to go everywhere. And this is why we start to see weird shapes , like if it multiplied in many like a fragsalization of the image because basically the rays of light are reflecting in the water or in crystal. This is what what is happened.

So this is how we can understand that why we see like kind of weird images through water and through crystals.

So actually now that the pure ray of light , white ray of light goes through a prism , this beautiful structure of crystal , this this perfect form and it goes straight to it. But what happened? It had so many cuts that the light does n't go through properly. It just starts to divide itself into different directions.

So this prism makes the light to go to spread into different speeds because some cuts makes the particles go faster , some others make them go slower.

So when we have after the rays of light goes through this prism , is the wavelength of the light.

So some of them will go faster , which is a high frequency sorry , and other ones will go lower so it 's the low frequency. And our eyes can capture this high or low frequencies and interpretive that into colors.

So that 's why we see a rainbow.

Okay , a rainbow basically is our ability to interpret the frequencies of this light that is being fragtulized. Also is important to note that this seven colors are not the real colors. Are the way in which we can interpret the wavelength in our brain. Because for example , if it is a beetle and insect , they will see ultraviolet light.

So this means that they want these colors we see and we can not see the colors that they see.

So it 's not specifically colors in the universe , but basically they are basically they are just wavelengths.

Okay , this wavelengths are information. The wave light , the white ray of light is pure and has all the package of information. But when it splits into many different frequencies , all information reaches in different levels.

So there are some information that violates very high and then violates very low.

So this data , this information is moving particles that will create organs and structures in the matter that will be able to interpret the information of that wavelength.

So this is why we create the nature creates organs according to those wavelengths.

## Practice Structure

So now when you see the rainbow , you will see the structure of light very properly organized. They are not mixed , they are not in chaotic organization.

So they need to find a way in order to stay in harmony in resonance one to another.

So it can work properly and the vibration information through it can in a good way.

So when it materialize something in nature , this one 's these colors , these vibrations must be order.

So this is why these seven colors that we see , they try to create structures that help the light beam that we are , the white light beam that we are , to find balance and to be in harmony.

So we can experience our own creation without any problem.

Okay , so this is how we can understand that our body is like this prison , that the the Prima that will through where the pure light of the spirit will go through and start to reflect dividing itself into many. But all of them inside trying to find the balance , this inner separation is the one that we will call endo crime , endo meaning inside and crime meaning separation , coming from the week , clean name , that means to separate things.

So the endo crime system is the part that we have inside that regulates this separation for all the things to be in balance and harmony.

So the endo crime system is the one in charge of homeostasis. Homeostasis comes from homo , that means all the same , start that means to be still and see the means the action of.

So homeostasis is the action of standing still all the same.

Okay , so let 's go to the frame that I did today or it to be understand and you see it. Endo crime meaning inner separation , what does it does , the endo crime system holds the homeostasis. Homeostasis.

So we can see here the different wavelength comes here from the lower one to the highest one. These are the main endo crime glands , means the seats of a note , the three.

So they are the seats of a note because some of them had the shape of a seat.

So in Latin , glands , glands means the seat of a note. Accord , okay , racial , thank you , Accord , so an Accord.

Okay , glands means Accord.

## Energy Work

So let 's take a view into the portals , the physical portals that we have to communicate with information of the spirit in the matter. The informations that transmit Asia , the physical plan , and they are the physical ports for the which they can understand the information of the mission. In the mission , we will look at the harmony through these languages. How do you know this?

This is the information , the codes that will manifest the physical parts of my body , physical parts of my body that are the doors to the information. And so when we know which part in our body are they , we can understand the way in which they try to harmonize our whole being like a rainbow.

So the main goal of the , of the glands is to create hormones. And what are hormones? Hormone are , that will mobilize the body. But as I say , what I 'm going to explain now is just a tiny little part , is a generally of this , because it 's so much information that if you want to know as specifically much more about this , you have to check , you have to read because there 's many books of this.

The glands will be like the ones that generate hormones and the hormones will be like this chemical composed compositions that will be produced in the glands in order to to create chemical reactions to the body , to make actions to set the body to do things that are good for surviving for life itself , for the production of life and energy in our body.

So imagine this , that one of these , each one of these glands generates these hormones that are so much powerful. It has so much energy , they create so much so much power in the body that if only one of them works much more than the others , the tiny quantity that it produces of hormones arise if the , this tiny quantity arise.

So it can create a disease , they can create a complete mess in the body.

So the main goal that , one of the goals that all this glands had is to try to control each one of them. If one of these glands activated itself like much more powerful , so all the rest might shut , shut it up. Like , do n't do this or shut up. I was saying that this is like kind of a meeting of seven guys , seven , seven guys that sit and discuss about something and one of them says , like , I say that this should be like this and stuns up and starts to shout , and all the rest , the other six will go , hey , hey , hey , calm down , sit down , take a deep breath , do n't break anything , okay , so what , what the team is trying to do is for each one of the glands to stay quiet.

If there is the case in which the body needs for one of them to harder or to do much more things , the other glands will try to control it and if that glands go beyond the limits , so immediately all of them will try to to control it to shut it up , okay , shut it down.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the , the whole thing about this system is that this tiny , seven glands has so much power , they create so much energy for us for us to be and to do what we have to do , that themselves they need to be quiet to control one another for us not to explode , basically , for us to survive , they are working 24 hours a day , all the time. This imagine that this , this , this gland , generate a lot of information and a lot of energy for us to exist , but some of them work much more when we are babies when we are young because the body is still in production , but eventually with the time , some of these glands interpretive that there is no need to do some things like for example to reproduce , so this is why the goals , the reproductive glands , they start to shut down because they say there is no need to reproduce anymore , so the , so this gland stop producing the hormones of reproduction and that 's what makes us feel much more low energy and how the body starts to to break down , okay , because before these glands were holding the vitality of the body , the functioning of these glands are the ones that generates the , that regenerated the energy of the cells , they , they make the information of the cells to move and to reproduce once and again , so when they stop working , when they stop doing their job , the cells stop receiving that information , so that 's why the system starts to go down , this is why we start to get older , start to to die , basically this is the reason why we died because these glands stop stop working , so if we would be able to pull them with energy all the time creating the energy all the time , we would live longer of course , so sometimes when we approach some of these glands and they have to take them out because they have a tumor or something like this , we need to take pills that has the hormones that that before were produced by the glands , because of course , otherwise we do n't have the organ that was made for that , we do n't have a natural way to produce the , the , the hormones that the body was producing with that lab , so when they take it away , we can have this problem , we need to take them from the outside , this glands are the prism , the , the prism that that translate the , of the spirit , the frequency into our life , but through our life , we live different things that mold this prism as into different shapes , so according to our emotions , our situations , the environment we live in , what we eat , all the things that we are receiving from the outside , they can shape these prisons into different ways , so that makes that the frequency can sometimes be better or sometimes be worst , and when it becomes worse when we create a conflict inside of our body that modify the glands , this will be like if the translation of the information that comes inside the body will be distorted like this , it will corrupt , so the data is not longer readable , is impossible to understand , and this is what it creates the cease , so we have the ceases , and in this , in this moments , we can understand that our emotions , our way of seeing life , our state of humor will be determined according to what we feel , sorry according to the state of the prisons that we have inside , because remember the organs are the ways in which we perceive the world , so let 's go over a little bit , so the first one , the lineal gland , lineal gland , sometimes you might relate it with the crown chara , but it 's not , the lineal is the third eye , the third eye , so the third eye is , is calling this even in science because it has photo-sensitable cells , so it kind of perceive the light in the same way as our eyes does it , so we can understand this as the third eye inside our brain and we can locate it here , so it 's the third eye and it has the shape of a pine seed , so that 's why in the all times they call it a pine seed , we have and the pine was related to the divinity , so that 's why they call it this part of connection with the divine , the spot of connection with the divinity , which is the third eye , the one that enables me to see the other realities from this spiritual realm , so it is located here in the center of the brain , in the head of the head , above the albums , which is the place where all the emotions and memories are registered , sensible things , so hypothesis , the hypothesis is that one built development , so hypothesis is below closer to the eyes , but this that is connected to the crown chara , why is this because this one , this gland is the one that controls all the rest , it 's like the king or the queen that controls everything , the controls the other glands with its own hormones rules the entire system , the thing is that the hypothesis is connected to the crown chara , because even physically is seated on the chair , that in that whole of the bone you can find the the hypothesis , so it 's like a throne , like a throne where the king or the queen sits to control the rest of the body , that 's why it 's related to the crown chara , connects with everything and goes through everything , and we can find it here close to the nose , to the nose , between the eyes , hypothesis usually is known as Petri-Tari-Lan , for sure you know it with that name , but I do n't like to call it like this , I deny to call it that , because it 's a horrible name , actually , maybe some of you do n't know , but in the science and spirituality they still call it Petri-Tari , but Petri-Tari is the way in which the wrong people used to call this gland , because they thought it was the one that generated the moccasin from the nose , so Petri-Tari in Latin means moccasin , moccasin , okay , so for respect to that gland which is the one that connects us with the spirituality and with the higher self here and now , so I rather not to call it Petri-Tari , I rather call it hypothesis , okay , remember that hypothesis means under the development or the growth , growing up , so the third , the third , third means shield , the shield , because it has the shape of a shield here on the neck , on the throat , so it is the connection between the hypothesis and the lineal gland with the other glands , it 's like a kind of communicator of the information , so this one here is the one that is related to the growth , to the development , to when we are growing up is the most important one , so it is related to communication between the glands and also the growth of the body , growing up the body , we have the timeout then which is the vital energy , it means vital energy , timeout and it is related to the defense , it is the one that generates the cells of immunocyl system to defend the body , so this is the timeout , as you see this gland is above the heart , covering the heart , so this is why it is related with the high heart chara , the high heart , okay , is above the heart , and and because it is a gland system that is helping the entire system to be safe , that 's why we call it also the one related to the unconditionally , so the lineal gland press , the pine press is the one that will generate the hormones that look for sugar in the blood , so it takes the sugar , so it brings us to the cells to feed the cells , the cells needs this this sugar in order to generate energy , so obviously the time press will tourism but time-creas means all the meat and it is related to the food of course , so remember that adrenal we have the adrenal here , upon both the kidneys and that 's precisely what adrenal means , adrenal is in Latin which means , aside the kidneys , kidneys is release , so arenas is to be aside the kidney , so that 's the name adrenal , in us is above but in some other animals is aside , so that 's why adrenal , adrenal then is not why we call it super-renal , super-renal also because it 's above , super-it 's above , the adrenal glands , the job that they have , that they have is to balance distress , balance this , so the body can , when the body is in stress it will put it down to relax or if it needs to have energy it will produces adrenaline adrenaline to have the energy to move , then we have the goals , the goals comes exactly from the same word as genitals , gon , gen is the same , meaning the origin , meaning the birth and so on , so these two are the same but they divide in feminine , when and so 's , over and in masculine in the male , the textiles , so basically in the process of gestation , exactly the same , they are the same but then when it 's decided whether it just feminine or masculine , they transform , so if this feminine , they will become the ovaries connected to the uterus and if it decides to be men , the ovaries will go out in this crotum to make cycles , okay , so it 's the same gland that goes out , makes the textiles and instead of uterus we will have prostate , the prostate is the gland related to the uterus and then it goes through the ultra , important to know , this here are the manifestation of the charts , okay , the manifestation of the charts , so this is energy , the charts are not something that goes inside of the body or go out from the body , the charts are basically the energy manifest into the glands , so the energy of the charts when it 's activated is what we will call hormones , to rub this concept , the endocrine system is the one that manifests the soul and the spirit here and now and the glands are the doors in between the information between all the dimensions , this is why it 's so important to know this body and how this body works , so whoever does n't read the post for today , I would recommend for you to do it to do it because today in post I explained each one of these systems where they are how they work , what are the motions related to it and tiny little explanations of how to maintain them what happened here is that the biological system is so huge , so perfect and so immense that it 's impossible to touch all the things , all the topics inside of this biology , this is the general information , so we can understand ourselves here what we are , what do we have , so here comes all the questions for sure , how can I know and determine what is my problem , why do I have this problem or that this disease of course , so for that you have hundreds of professionals that can help you with biodecretation , we have many other things but mostly I will recommend you biodecretification , people that can help you to go deeper into the interpretation of why do you have , why do you have this problem from where it comes from , what is your body trying to tell you and I am saying biodecretification mainly to understand these concepts and not the energetic ones like some therapies with energy and feeling and so on , why , because it 's important to recognize that we are humans and we have a body , we have to understand our own body to understand the communication with the other realities , this is our tool to understand this world and the universe , so this is why I would recommend you to use therapies that speak to you about the specific disease , the problem which part of the body , how it works the organ , maybe you need some chemical to restore the balance , maybe you need some food to change something or whatever , so pay attention to your body which is the tool that you have to communicate with the other thing , okay the vibration is car , the statement for today is I am channel between consciousness , the code for today is the digestive system , for the blood to be able to perform this distribution function , it must see if this nutrients and chemical elements and the way it does it is through the digestive system , I am what I eat , incorporating from the tongue , the soft-roost stomach , pancreas , physical , liver and small intestines , everything that we invest is processed and divided into its minimal expression so that the large intestine can absorb this element and transfer them to the circulatory system , not only in a physical level but also on an emotional one , the system is in charge of processing all the useful and let the useless through , to much biology today , offer positive eyes and concentrate in your breathing I take a deep breath and I become aware of the body that I inhabit I am aware of my feet , my legs , my waist , hands , arms , back in chest , neck and my head softly I start to carry the body to touch it part of it. Moving every joint and circles.

Softly. From my feet. Going up. Stretching the body.

I take it in breath and I yarn. Stretching the body. In every direction.

Softly. I carry some touch. Every part of the body. Feeling which part of this.

Makes me feel uncomfortable. Which part makes me feel pleasure. I move and touch my body. As I would touch your body.

Of why I love. Feeling the touch of the hands. And the leaves. The face.

And the sound. Feel better. Feeling a nice Bridge watch. I enjoy touching every team in terms of my body.

I am realizing every part of it listening to the heartbeat to the pulse. Each one of it 's sometimes sitting down , relaxing , letting all the weight fall down. The first thing I do is to relax the head. My little major fall down slow.

Pay attention to how it released attention. Even opening your mouth , chilling how it drops. For a sieve , the relaxation of feeling your jaw , hanging from your head. I feel how my shoulders relax , letting the weight of my arms and hands fall down.

I release the tension of my legs and the back. I take a deep breath and relax.

Softly and much effort. I start to bring my hands to the top of my head and start to carry it down , feeling the sensation going down from my head to the forehead , the eyebrows. Messaging softly like a racing oil to both sides , tracing the nose , side of the head. I rise in the ears and circles.

I read on my side the head of the head of the head and the penielblam.

Softly I go down to the lower part of the throat and massage and softly in the racing intervening the throat. I go down to the chest to the high part into the things and opening the chest softly. I start to hoping , up and down , once and again , alone the stern. I go down , racing to the stomach , a sudden deep feeling the pancreas.

I go back with my hands to the middle part of my back , sending heat with a pop of my hands to the kidneys. I recognise the adornals in this part. I go down through the waist with my hands and the high of the ovaries in the women and your hands in the textiles in the men.

## Energy Work

Softly I massage , racing. I take a deep breath and relax my hands on the sides of my body. I become aware conscious of the physical portals in a certain way. I recognise each one of them as my deep-frenning conscious connected by my inner channel.

I unite them with a sound. I go down , racing to the stomach , racing to the stomach. I have this consciousness in me. I have this consciousness in me.

## Q&A

Racing. Take a deep breath and each one at a time. Come back here and now. And those who follow the task for this month take this energy , put it into the water and pour it to the seats that we have sold.

## Daily Practice Elements

Remember that today we begin our month of the mantra that we will say before we go to sleep , which is I am for you. Thank you everybody for being here another day. And as always see you tomorrow at the same time.
