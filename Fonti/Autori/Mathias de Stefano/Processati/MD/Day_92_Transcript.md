## Introduction

Good afternoon , good evening. I am better today. Yesterday , sorry about yesterday that I just , it was not myself who cut the I have been like for another hour , like in that state. But I felt it was really difficult to explain how it is , how what was the feeling , but it was really great.

And I felt really , really , really well.

So yesterday , who appear was someone that is kind of an expression of , that 's like a program of creation. And it was really , it 's being that worse , like in light and darkness , at the same time. And it was like , like feeling the whole weight of the planet , but in such a balance that was really perfect and beautiful. And I am still feeling it in such way.

## Q&A

So the task for all this month will be to , will be to , to write down all our dreams. And well , yeah , all our dreams to write them down , like if you have , for example , notebook or you can record it in the phone , something very close to you during the night.

So you do n't have to get up from your bed and write it down. No , thinking about what what the dreams mean , okay , just write it down. Do n't think about it , just write them and that 's it. Or record it , but that 's it.

No thinking.

The reason why we are going to have this task for everyday is because dreams are the way in which our subconscious is talking to us constantly.

So is the way in which all our subconscious express and talks to us and show us what is there. And this thing about the dreams is because Scorpio is in its depth is related to the subconscious , to the big ocean.

So this is why we will go into the depth of our subconscious by dreaming. To write down or to record our dreams day by day , is something is a tool that will help us to , to communicate easily with our subconscious.

So of course there is a lot of people that say , I do n't dream , but that 's not like that. We all dream. The only problem is that we do n't remember. That 's a different thing.

Because usually when we dream is the moment where we are relaxed , relaxed the most.

So it 's not by the end of dreaming that because you are waking up , eventually you are starting to wake up.

So what is really happening is that we usually dream several times during the day , during the phases where you relax the most when you dream. Those are the specific moments when you really dream.

So I will give you some advice or some , I do n't know , until maybe you remember your dreams , which is around 30 minutes before you go to sleep , drink a lot of water , a lot of water. Because for sure , your body will say suddenly when you relax the most , like , now go to the bathroom. And for sure , in that moment , you will be dreaming.

So these are just some tools and with the time and practice , you will be able to connect and communicate with your subconscious. All these tools are because during all this month of Scorpio , we will be working with the subconscious.

So this is by dreaming is the best way to communicate with that subconscious , because in the subconscious , all the information that I have within , it shows itself as it simply is. No mind , no interpretation , subconscious just show up.

So that 's why we have to practice and we will have this whole month to do so.

So dreams , creativity , trauma , fears , all of that will just appear.

So just this , do n't try to understand why what are the meanings of the dreams. Just write them down or just record them , that 's it. You have to communicate with the subconscious , so no mind in both. We will have time in other moments whenever you feel to try to figure out what those dreams mean.

But without mind , just write it down , allow the dream to come to you. You start to communicate , okay? No mind in it.

The reason why I say do n't think about specifically what is the meaning of the dreams , because that is to put a mind on that , to think about that , like to put a goal with your mind in the dream. And in order to understand a dream through the subconscious , we will use the tool which is the topic for today , which is intuition.

The reason why we are going to talk about intuition and what is intuition. We have to understand that intuition is something they related with water signs. We have these three signs of water , which are pieces , cancer and scorpion.

So this means that basically these three signs are the most intuitive of the whole group of 12. And the easy way to understand this is with this example. If you have a very high noise in the air , it will maybe reach a kilometer or a little bit more. It will reach a few , but in the air , it spreads the sound spreads , why they are just disappear faster.

But in the water , water kind of pushed the waves.

So a whale , a dolphin , is able to communicate , to talk through many , many thousands and a few kilometers.

So this means that in water , the vibration arrives faster and farther than in the air.

So the reason why is the signs , they say they are more intuitive , is because as water , they can perceive their five senses , they are more refined. For us , intuition would feel something that is happening way far away , or something that will happen. And the view kind of feels you perceive it.

So it 's like if the water signs have very , very good , designed senses that they can perceive things way farther than the other ones.

So when we say about intuition , sometimes we relate this like as another senses , like the six senses , for example , but it 's not that. What really happened is that the people that is very sensitive and intuitive is not that they have a six or seven senses. Is that they are very , they 're more sharp , it says. Yeah , the five senses for those people are more sharp , very , yeah , like they are more.

So it 's not that we have more senses , is that we use the five senses , but. Very high immigration like acute , thank you , like. Very sharp and acute , okay.

So , so because of this , you can perceive things that are very high in vibration , which are the ones can not feel. But it 's not other senses , it 's the five senses in a different level of vibration.

So , so basically the intuition is related with this refining of the senses. A lot of people ask and usually say , how is possible , how can I talk with my guides , how can I. How can I listen to them , how can I see other realities , how can I feel other dimensions , how is possible to do that. And the reason why we do n't accomplish that is because we think that.

We think that to feel in other dimensions , you need another senses. You need another , another sense that is beyond the five senses , like a gift. But nobody has a gift , really. What what people is using to connect with other dimensions are the five senses , but refined.

So it 's not a gift for some people. All of us have the same tools. We can all use those tools , but we are just thinking that this is something that I do n't have and other people have. And it 's not like that.

So how can I use my senses , then?

So I have to refine my senses. I have to use my senses , refine very deep my five senses in order to be able to do that. And how can I refine them? Well , you have to practice with them.

You have to practice each one of your senses by separate.

So you need to touch again and perceive the reality with your touch much more deep. You have to smell better. You have to taste and enjoy the taste of things. You have to learn how to listen.

You have to learn how to see to contemplate reality , the colors , everything. When you start to use your senses much more refined , then you will be able to feel all dimensions.

So for sure you have heard some other people that maybe say this is some people have to give , some people does n't have to give , or everything is separate , like one dimension , the other dimension. But it 's not like that. It 's not really , it 's not like that. Everything is one thing , everything is connected.

So it 's not that you have to have to give from , or that some people have to give and you do n't have it. The only reality is that those people , maybe , they have more active , the ability to perceive in one way , like some people knows how to listen.

So they are really good musicians.

Some other people know how to touch , but other ones know how to make numbers.

So that we all have the same , we all have the same tools , which are the senses.

So it 's not about the other one has this and I do n't have it. It 's about the other one , can perceive it , and I ca n't yet , but I have the same tool. The good example would be , like for example , I have here a panel in my room. And imagine that the 8,000 people that they know , 8 billion , we are too many , too many humans , 8 billion people that we have in the world today.

Imagine that each one of us has a piano at home.

Some people will play the lower notes , some people will hire notes , some people will play rock , some people will play classic.

Some people will just touch note , and then constantly the same. I do n't know , and some people wo n't touch any , because nothing , but we all have the same piano , we all have pianos.

So I can learn how to play the piano , I can do it. We have it.

So now imagine that you have this piano , and you want to learn how to touch the piano , how to play the piano , another touch it , to play the piano.

So , and here comes intuition. Intuition would be the ability to perceive the , the next notes that you have to play , even if you are not playing a song , that you have no idea about which song , you just , the water signs , they will just feel it. They will just touch , and it does n't matter if it makes noise or whatever , they will just feel it. And that 's it.

So by feel , you will rebound , you will resonate with the song , even if it is not the song.

So eventually you will know exactly what note comes next , because by feeling , you just perceive where to go. And you are not thinking about it. The air signs , they basically are thinking , they have all in the mind.

So they are thinking constantly if they are doing it right or not. The fire signs , they are thinking constantly , I want to listen , I write it song , I want , I want it now. I want to hear it perfect now. And the earth signs , they would have a big book in front saying , oh , this is , this is A , this is B , A , B , that would be earth.

So the water signs , basically they will just flow , they will just perceive. And that 's intuition , intuition is the ability to perceive what is coming next without any , without expecting anything. Just feeling it.

So what intuition means? Intuition comes from the words in and 20 in Latin , and to where means like to watch , to contemplate , to observe.

So in 20 means to be in the process of contemplation. To be in the concept , to be in the process of contemplation.

So basically intuition is to observe yourself , not to take action , but to perceive , that 's it.

## Guided Meditation

So the process of intuition takes us to the death , as we spoke yesterday , this higher being that is observing and watching everything. It can only watch , it can only see , it see things in the outside. But it can not previsualize the things. It can visualize the reality , but this thing can not previsualize.

What it is to previsualize is to not see what I have in front , but it 's to close my eyes and wander by resonance , vibration , when it 's the action that that thing is going to take. And the only way in which I can do that is by feeling and imagining.

So intuition is to understand that everything is in such a way connected.

So the best way to understand this is if you are watching the world outside , when you see a wave going there , in the ocean , you all the things that you will see is a wave moving forward. But when you feel the ocean , you will feel that that wave that is going there is going to come back to me. And that 's intuition. How can I do to activate my intuition then?

So I have to feel with each one of my senses. Much more refined to practice to feel with my refined senses. Going to the matter , to the depth , to the dark , where I can practice the senses.

Now , you may realize that nature , the universe , what it does is to say , hey , in order to activate the potential of your five senses , you need to feel more to perceive more.

So the reality starts to push and press this five senses.

So it could feel more and more and more.

So as much pressure I can feel , I will be able to activate even more my ability to feel. This concept of awakening the potential of the senses takes us to understand that the way in which we can activate as much as possible the way we feel is with pressure.

So in ancient times , to feel a lot of pressure is to have a weight , weight very heavy on us.

So in Rome , they would say that we are under an iron under iron , like a very heavy iron receiving the pressure. And this was called superhero. Superhero means under the iron. And now we say that super suffering.

Basically , we suffer in order to activate the potential of our senses.

So I described also this process in the blog with a Calvary. The Calvary is a Latin word that means skull.

So it means to go deep to the bone.

So whoever is living in Calvary , like humans are living in Calvary , is like go deep into the bone to the filling. And do you know why basically human suffer , why we have to suffer? It 's not because the universe is saying humans must suffer in order to awake its potential.

Now suffering is the choice , it 's an option. And why is an option? Because the reason why human suffer is because instead of being who they are supposed to be to activate their own potential. Who they have to be.

They are escaping constantly from their own potentials. And they are trying to leave the lives of others.

So you just run away from your own self trying to leave the lives of others. And that 's what we 're suffering. It 's simply as that. And whoever is trying to escape from their own potential , they create suffering in others.

Like Hitler , for example. Hitler , he wanted to act. He wanted to be an actor. He wanted to paint.

And nobody allowed him.

So if he would become an actor , maybe another history would be.

So this is why nobody can , This is why nobody can take you out from the suffering. The only one able to take you out from the suffering is your own ability to become more intuitive.

So this is why we have to pay attention to our dreams because all the things that we push away when we have this intuition and we say , No , no , no , I should n't do that. You put it all in darkness.

So it 's now all in the subconscious.

## Daily Practice Elements

So this is why we have to pay attention to our dreams and talk to them in order to hear them. The , the vibration for today is meh. The statement for today is I am consciousness expansion. The code for today is co-creation.

By recognizing ourselves as products and creators , we are aware that all creation is not our own , it 's collective. Nothing that we generate as new will have a personal purpose. No , the energy needed generate , , it will , nor the energy needed. Generate , ah , to generate it will come entirely for me.

But the energy used to manifest a reality comes from a network of creators and through , their products will be inevitably shared by all and wo n't belong to one person. Is it comfortable? I began to move my shoulders and circles. Until I relaxed and let all the weight fall down , focus in my breathing.

I perceive the light around me , coming towards my skin. Feeling it shine as outside , so inside. In all directions. I perceive the light , shining right and right through , all around.

And within. I recognize that I am. I am the higher self. The shines as a ray of light.
