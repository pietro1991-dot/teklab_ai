## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , you have to know the deepening.

So , I will take a while until I explain it 's something for today because I forgot the mic for the people here behind can hear me.

So , I will have to wait until somebody bring it to me. This is a code sign for someone to bring me the audio.

Remember that we are not following the astrological calendar.

So , we are not working aligned with the astrological ear. We are using the. . .

The Atlanta calendar which is each month has a different attribute.

So , even if yesterday I started the month of. . .

Sorry , even if yesterday we entered in areas time , we have still 10 days more of high this is according to our month of that lantern calendar.

So , remember that it 's not correlated , so do n't worry about it.

So , remember that today is the last day when we say. . . When we say the intention , I am.

. . I am wisdom before we go to sleep. And tomorrow we start with the intentions every time we go to sleep.

For the next month , we say. . . I am real.

So , just for you to know , maybe you are listening to the. . . How to say , huh?

How to say English? Hon? Hon , hon , hon. Hon?

Okay.

So , this sounds. . . Of the cars all the time.

And that 's because. . . In each year you do n't have many roles to drive.

And basically most of the people. . . Does n't study to drive.

They just buy the In.

So , the way they communicate when they drive is by. . . Did it good?

So , that 's it. That 's 24 hours all the time , so welcome to you. Let 's begin with today , which is the torus and we close the emotional wake. The topic for today is compassion.

So , of course , the first thing that we have to understand about this word before we go into. . . The topic is.

. . The origin of the two words that compose the word , which is gone and passion. Compassion.

Confirm the two words in Latin that means that are gone and passion. Gone means with. . .

Which is in Latin the conjunction of something. And passion that is the word. . .

That is the word from the verb satire. In Latin , satire means to suffer. And satire means to suffer. And passion , which is the origin of passion , passion means pain.

So , basically compassion is to share the pain with others. For sure , in our history of understanding this concept , we have been understanding compassion in a wrong way , maybe. For example , myself. I confused myself all the time passion.

I have no idea what it was compassion. Because for me , for a long time compassion was to feel pity for others. That 's what I thought it was compassion. But actually , then I understood that compassion was more.

. . Much more about to feel what the others are feeling.

So now we can explain how these three concepts that we have been talking about. . . .

. . Correlate to each other. The empathy , sympathy and compassion.

We have spoken about empathy. Empathy is to be in the pain with others. Sympathy is to accompany the pain of others. And compassion is the same as sympathy.

Why? Because sympathy in Greek means. . .

. . . To go with the pain.

So , sin and paths. Things mean pain. Which is the same , the Latinization of the word , con passion. Which is to go with the pain.

So it 's exactly the same. But one in Greek , the other one in Latin. But even though they took different paths along our vocabulary.

So basically compassion would mean to be able to understand the other. To comprehend the problem that the other is having. And also to set the intention to help the other transcend that pain , that problem.

So we can understand that empathy is to feel what the other is feeling. To be exactly what the other is feeling. And compassion would be to connect with the pain of the other. But with the goal of taking that pain out and to transcend it into a different reality.

An interesting word that I would like to. . . .

. . For us to understand , which is part of this compassion , is the word passion. Because passion , we use it in a very different way from which.

. . . .

. From the reason for what it was created. For us passion is the things that we love to do. Our passion , our lives , our passion for things.

I am passionate by something. And this describes the things that we love the most that we love to do to learn and so on. But the origin of the word passion , which is to pain , to suffer , is because since long time ago , and since the beginning of our civilization , of our cultures , those things that we wanted the most were so difficult to get that we needed to make a hard work to reach it.

So that 's why they said , if you want to have it , you need to work hard in order to get it. And this is a very old idea of making a great effort to accomplish to have all the things that you wish for. This is why the description of passion is related with how much you have to suffer , how much you have to afford yourself to make this pain through your body in order to get what you really want as a result. This is the reason why passion is a synonym of pain , of hard work , which is not related with the vision that we have today about passion , which is to do that thing that we love.

So the word passion changed the concept only in this century , in the 21st century. And this is because since thousands of years , we have been doing a hard work to get what we want. The result of what we want.

So that 's why we needed to suffer a lot to get our results. But to get a result , but today in this century , we have been evolving in this concept into what we want to do what we like.

So this is very different from our entire history from the first time. And why we still use the same words to describe what it is to do what you like , but it 's not saying exactly the same.

So here we have this concept of compassion that is important to get to know. And I guess that 's the hidden message of compassion , which is that compassion kind of explains the passion of health. The passion of helping others. The passion of helping others would mean that you are able to feel the pain , the suffering of others.

And you are willing to do something in order to help them to transcend , to go into freedom aspect of their lives. Compassion is a term that it has been very used in many cultures , in many religions and most of all in the Christianity. Because the Christians were god united because of the suffering of Christ. That 's why it was called the passion of Christ.

The passion of Christ is the suffering of Jesus.

So this is why in the ideology of christians that compassion because of the Messiah suffering on the cross was a message that they started to spread in between all the people.

So everyone could be compassion.

So they could understand that we have to take care of one another to protect one another.

So I understand the suffering of the other and help to be all together as one. But of course , one thing is to say another to do.

So the concept of christians about compassion is to share the weight of the one that suffered for all of us in the cross. That 's the view , the point of view of christians. But the great concept of compassion , sympathy , is basically to comprehend the pain of the other and help the other to transcend that pain.

So basically the image would be that I absorb the pain of the world to feel it , understand it and by acknowledging it within myself. I find the tools to open myself to the world and help everybody to transcend that pain. And that 's how we shape the torus of the emotional weak of Jesus.

So remember that beyond cultures , religions , philosophies , whatever the main key of compassion is to take the pain of the world and the stand the pain. Integrated in me so I can find the tools to help the rest around the world. That 's it because I have no much voice because this past three days had been singing all day and channeling different beings that use my throat like a speed input. The motivation for today is the sound.
