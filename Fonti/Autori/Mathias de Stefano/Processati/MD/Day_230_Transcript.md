## Overview

Speaking from Egypt after three days of channeling and singing in the pyramids, Matias's voice is nearly gone. But today we close the Emotional Week of Pisces with the toroid chakra and the topic of compassion.

Note: We are not following the astrological calendar but the Atlantean calendar. Even though we entered Aries time yesterday, we still have 10 days more of Pisces according to the Atlantean calendar.

Also note: Today is the last day to say the intention "I am wisdom" before sleep. Tomorrow we start with "I am real."

Today's teaching connects empathy, sympathy, and compassion, revealing how passion transformed from suffering to pursuing what we love—and how compassion is the key to absorbing the world's pain and transcending it together.

## The Three Related Concepts

### Empathy

We've spoken about empathy in Day 226.

**Empathy** = to be in the pain with others (em-pathos: in pain)

### Sympathy

**Sympathy** = to accompany the pain of others (sym-pathos: with pain)

### Compassion

**Compassion** = the same as sympathy

Why? Because sympathy in Greek means to go with the pain (syn + pathos).

Compassion is the Latinization of the same word: **con-passion** (with pain).

It's exactly the same. One in Greek, the other in Latin. But even though they took different paths along our vocabulary, they mean the same thing.

---

## Etymology of Compassion

### Two Latin Words

**Compassion** comes from two words in Latin:
- **Con** = with, together (the conjunction of something)
- **Passion** (from **patire**) = to suffer

In Latin, **patire** means to suffer. **Passion** means pain.

So basically, **compassion is to share the pain with others**.

---

## Matias's Confusion with Compassion

### Thinking It Was Pity

For sure, in our history of understanding this concept, we've been understanding compassion in a wrong way, maybe.

For example, Matias himself: "I confused myself all the time with passion. I had no idea what compassion was. Because for me, for a long time, compassion was to feel pity for others. That's what I thought it was compassion."

### The Real Meaning

But actually, then he understood that compassion was much more about to feel what the others are feeling.

Compassion means to be able to understand the other, to comprehend the problem that the other is having, and also to set the intention to help the other transcend that pain, that problem.

---

## The Transformation of "Passion"

### What Passion Means Today

An interesting word that is part of compassion is the word **passion**.

We use it in a very different way from the reason for which it was created.

For us, passion is:
- The things we love to do
- Our lives, our passion for things
- "I am passionate by something"

This describes the things we love the most, that we love to do, to learn.

### The Origin of Passion

But the origin of the word passion, which is "to pain, to suffer," is because since long time ago, and since the beginning of our civilizations and cultures, those things that we wanted the most were so difficult to get that we needed to make hard work to reach it.

So that's why they said: **"If you want to have it, you need to work hard in order to get it."**

This is a very old idea of making a great effort to accomplish, to have all the things you wish for.

### Passion = Suffering to Get What You Want

This is why the description of passion is related with:
- How much you have to suffer
- How much you have to push yourself
- How much pain you make your body go through in order to get what you really want as a result

This is the reason why passion is a synonym of pain, of hard work—which is not related with the vision we have today about passion, which is to do that thing that we love.

### The Word Changed Only Recently

So the word passion changed the concept only in this century, in the 21st century.

And this is because since thousands of years, we have been doing hard work to get what we want, the result of what we want.

So that's why we needed to suffer a lot to get our results.

But today, in this century, we have been evolving in this concept into "do what you want, do what you like."

So this is very different from our entire history, from the first time. And this is why we still use the same words to describe what it is to do what you like, but it's not saying exactly the same.

## The Hidden Message of Compassion

### The Passion of Helping

Here we have this concept of compassion that is important to get to know.

And the hidden message of compassion is that **compassion kind of explains the passion of helping**.

The passion of helping others.

### Willing to Help Transcend

The passion of helping others would mean that you are able to feel the pain, the suffering of others, and you are willing to do something in order to help them to transcend, to go into the freedom aspect of their lives.

---

## Compassion in Christianity

### Used in Many Cultures

Compassion is a term that has been very used in many cultures, in many religions, and most of all in Christianity.

### United by the Suffering of Christ

Because the Christians were united because of the suffering of Christ.

That's why it was called **the Passion of Christ**.

The Passion of Christ is the suffering of Jesus.

### Spreading the Message

So this is why in the ideology of Christians, compassion—because of the Messiah suffering on the cross—was a message that they started to spread among all the people.

So everyone could be compassion. So they could understand that we have to:
- Take care of one another
- Protect one another
- Understand the suffering of the other
- Help to be all together as one

### One Thing to Say, Another to Do

But of course, one thing is to say, another to do.

So the concept of Christians about compassion is to share the weight of the one that suffered for all of us on the cross.

That's the view, the point of view of Christians.

## The Great Concept of Compassion

### Beyond Christianity

But the great concept of compassion, sympathy, is basically to:
- Comprehend the pain of the other
- Help the other to transcend that pain

### Absorbing the Pain of the World

So basically, the image would be that:

**I absorb the pain of the world to feel it, understand it, and by acknowledging it within myself, I find the tools to open myself to the world and help everybody to transcend that pain.**

### Shaping the Toroid

And that's how we shape the toroid of the Emotional Week of Pisces.

---

## The Key of Compassion

### Beyond Cultures and Philosophies

Remember that beyond cultures, religions, philosophies, whatever, the main key of compassion is to:

**Take the pain of the world and understand the pain. Integrate it in me so I can find the tools to help the rest around the world.**

## Practice

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on breathing.

Feel the energy that goes all through your body—to each organ, muscle, each cell, each pattern.

Feel the magnetism, the expanding energy in hot and cold. Recognize that this energy is your emotions.

Perceive which emotions you can feel now. How do you feel?

Take a deep breath. Feel how all these emotions expand throughout your entire body, dissolving it.

Feel each one of the particles that shape your body explode and expand to the entire world.

**Become the entire planet.**

Take a moment to open yourself to feel the pain and the suffering of this world:
- Suffering of every human, animal, and plant
- Suffering in every frontier and ocean

Recognize it. Recognize each conflict in you. All this pain.

**I am the world.**

Feel its force. Recognize that the pain is within you.

You have the strength. You will be empowered to heal all that pain and suffering.

Bring the pain of the world toward you. Recognize it.

Take this pain and suffering as the fuel to create its own healing.

Take a deep breath, warm, and again, once again.

Bring all this potential and energy to the ground, to the earth. Expand and reach the entire world now with that awareness that this pain is energy, is useful for the healing process.

Bring to you the pains of the world, and with your consciousness, expand it to the world.

**This is the greatest of my passions.**

Sound the vibration from your toroid.

**I am the world. I am the world.**

**I am the eternal will. I am the eternal will.**

**I believe in my compassion.**

**I am the world.**

## Integration

Today, practice compassion by:

1. **Feeling** the pain of someone around you (not just intellectually understanding)
2. **Absorbing** that pain into yourself (not running from it)
3. **Understanding** it within yourself (finding the tools to address it)
4. **Helping** them transcend it (not just sharing the suffering, but transforming it)

This is different from empathy (being in the pain) or sympathy (accompanying the pain). This is compassion: sharing the pain with the goal of transcending it together.

Remember: passion is no longer just suffering. In the 21st century, we do what we love. Let your greatest passion be helping others transcend their suffering.

---

## Week Context

We are closing the Emotional Week of Pisces with the toroid chakra—the eternal field that connects all, the loop of energy that flows in and out, never ending.

Pisces energy is perfect for compassion because Pisces has walked the entire zodiac wheel and can feel what all signs experience. Pisces absorbs the pain of the world and transforms it.

The toroid is the perfect symbol: pain comes in, understanding integrates it, healing flows out, back to the world, in an eternal cycle.

## Q&A

### Q: How is compassion different from empathy?

Empathy is being in the pain. Compassion is sharing the pain with the intention to help transcend it. Empathy can overwhelm you. Compassion transforms the pain into healing action.

### Q: If I absorb the world's pain, won't I be crushed by it?

Not if you also integrate it and find tools to heal it. The toroid practice shows this: you take it in, transform it within, send healing out. It's a flow, not a storage.

### Q: Why did "passion" change meaning in the 21st century?

Because for the first time in history, we can pursue what we love without as much suffering. For thousands of years, getting what you wanted required immense hard work and pain. Now we can follow our joy.

### Q: Is compassion the same as pity?

No. Pity is looking down on someone's suffering. Compassion is sharing their pain as an equal and helping them rise above it together.

### Q: How do I help someone transcend their pain?

First, feel it and understand it within yourself. Then you'll know what tools they need. You can't help transcend what you don't understand. This is why you must absorb it first.

### Q: What does it mean to "be the world"?

To recognize that all suffering is connected, all pain is shared. When you expand your awareness to the entire planet, you stop seeing "their" pain and "my" pain—it's all one pain, and you're part of healing it.

### Q: Is compassion only for humans?

No. The practice includes "suffering of every human, animal, and plant." All beings suffer. All beings deserve compassion.
