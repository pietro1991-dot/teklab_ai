## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. I hope everyone is okay to begin with this new day of alignment.

Today related to the niece. In the emotional week of critical , for everyone that is followed every day at the same hour , I have to say that in a few days , I will be changing the things because I am living. I live the place , I wo n't be in this moment , in this place for at least 10 days more. But I 'm not living Egypt , I go to the Nile on a boat.

Because , I am , there are a lot of people right now that are players of handball teams. I know you 've seen in the news , but Egypt decided to keep going with this schedule of an international championship of handball. And many of the players that came has COVID.

So they had in the rooms where I am staying. They have a lot of people with COVID that are locked in quarantine in the rooms. I am quarantine also here , closed in another part of the hotel.

So I am not in touch with anyone.

So they were also for me to be away and side this place during this day.

So I 'm living , okay.

So just wanted to let you know that I 'm not going to be here. And the signal will be one bit best.

So I would be connected anyway every day. But maybe the signal is not the best.

So I just wanted for you to know that for the next time the next week , I 'm not going to be here. We 'll be fine.

So let 's begin with the topic for today. The topic for today is a diversity , which is kind of the things that we are living today. This kind of conflicts.

So let 's talk about diversity. I hope you can see me well today. I do n't know. I was saying that I hope you see me well , but the image not me because I would have to have big source in front.

So you did n't see how I looked today.

So just give me a moment to try to explain what is adversity because right now I have nothing in my head.

So let me a moment to find out what is the code.

So let 's begin by understanding the origin of the word we can start with the idea.

Sorry , I was smelling a lot of roses. And I 'm going to do this. Is this. Suddenly.

If I 'm smelling it , that I do n't have co-reads.

So that 's good thing.

So remember , we go to this. Adverse universe has the same origin.

Okay , so both of them comes from versus. That means to turn to bend to toward.

Okay , torsion. To. Yes to. To make a torsion.

To make a torsion. Turn. Turn. , bend.

Okay , all this works. Universe comes from versus and uns that means one. One. And add.

Come from the word to to go to someplace.

Okay. Universe. Means. The one that turns to itself again.

The one that bends its own body to itself. The ones that comes back again to itself. And at verse means that thing that goes to bend itself.

Something.

Sorry. That goes to the direction of bending of distortion of. Of. Of turning.

Okay.

So. That would be the difference. This. This.

This. This. This. This.

This. This. This. This.

That. And.

So.

So. Others. Go to work. That.

That. The. The. The.

It. Of something that is distorted.

So remember , the universe is only one origin and this origin projects into a different being outside , so it is itself.

So it 's kind of a projection from one to another. But the universe does n't project and is pulls apart a bit into the opposite from inside the universe in order to create the other one bends itself.

So let 's take like for example that the universe is only one line.

Now , picture this that if we have this being only one being , there is another way to see it. We can see it in depth. And if we see it in depth , we have a line.

So if that this dot here is just the spot in the beginning of this one , creates line. How does this spot from here that observes this direction should be able to observe also this direction?

So the way it becomes able to see both together is by dividing itself into.

So it does n't cut in half , it bends in half.

So now I have two eyes. After error un patron , so this keep bending itself until they create a pattern. Ready? Then they start to bend again , so they begin to create another pattern.

So they bend again to create another pattern. To create another pattern and the biting and dividing ones and again , this is what we call the bending of time and space.

So , the same thing happened with the sphere , like dividing itself in order to bend to itself , to see a different perception of itself.

So , it creates , like , for example , one dark side here , okay? But it 's not different , it 's just one bending to itself. The paradox of this system is that everything is just one , all the being , trying to see itself the one that it is.

So , it tries to bend to , to , for , to see the unity. But the paradox is that as many times it divides itself , you have many more options.

So , it creates many other distortions and options as much it tries to reach itself.

So , it , for , the universe starts to create so many options , so many systems , because this is the only way it can , it has to find the unity , the whole.

So , if it does n't do this path , it will never become aware of this , okay?

So , this is why it , of itself.

So , this is why it needs to divide itself in order to be aware of what the unity means. The , the everything , if it does n't observe itself , everything is nothing. It does n't mean anything. Because what is the goal of the everything , if it 's not being able to , to experience itself.

So , this is why the , the self , the , the everything starts to divide itself.

So , it can watch itself , experience itself.

So , it can see many other options. Grow. The sun gives a meaning to the everything.

Okay? That 's why it , it seems , a logical , but it 's logic. The , everything , to understand the , everything needs to divide.

Okay? See? Just to remember , what is the universe , is only one being that divides itself , so it can see another option of itself.

So , it starts to bend.

So , here the universe , the , the universe , the one , divide itself , and turns itself to another direction , going away from the unity , going to the duality. And that 's what we call , add , verse. Add , verse is the system to where it goes.

So , remember , from the universe through the adverse , we create the diverse. You remember that? Divers.

So , unity is one. The is two.

Okay?

So , we are diverse beings. Why are we diverse beings? Why we are diverse beings? Because we are basically divided into , all the beings about reality are diverse , because we have been divided , bent into.

So , all the beings in the universe , we have been divided into , divided , bent into.

So , all the beings in the universe exist through this duality that we call time and space.

So , from the unity comes the duality of time and space. How does this great eye , the only one eye , to become good? How does this one eye , turns into two different eyes of the universe of the diverse?

So , through the adverse , the adversity is the quality , the path that the unity takes to reach the duality.

So , it means that for the universe , adversity , something that is adverse , is very important , because it needs adversity to create , to divide , because adverse is the path that takes to create something , that 's why the path for vision is adverse. It has conflicts on it , it has division , bending , breaking , dividing. It has conflicts , just because of this.

So , as you see here , conflict , universe is fundamental.

Now , let 's see this. I hope you get this.

Now we have this division from this side , Jack and like this to this other side.

So , the universe will have an adverse path to reach the diverse.

So , the diverse will also have an adverse path to reach the universe.

So , we would say that here we find the divine universe , and then we have here this animals , people , and plants , and tree , and the diverse.

So , here the people , the animals , the plants , will also try to find the unity from the diversity.

So , the universe will need to divide itself as many times possible in order to reach this division , the system.

So , in order to reach this system , the universe will have to be by two , as many times as possible until it reached the diversity.

So , when the diverse reaches its lower point of this torsion , the distortion starts to reach again the unity to give a meaning a sense of a thing.

So , everything that was separated must come back again to the unity.

So , now , it 's much more easy to separate than unite. In this process , the universe generates conflict in order to , through the diversity , find the diversity. And the diversity needs to solve the conflict in order to reach the universe again.

So , basically conflict is something that is bending into size to different parts.

So , the one that creates conflict from the universe is the creator , because it needs to create for diversity only exists because of the creation. It 's a creator itself , creates in the conflict. The people or the beings in the diversity are the only ones able to solve the conflicts , because they know we know all the different parts of the conflict. We have the experience.

This is something that makes us work the responsibility.

## Q&A

So , imagine here that in this concept , the divine is the one creating the division , but the different aspects by the consciousness , they do n't know how to solve it , so they ask for salvation to God , to the divinity of there. The responsibility lies here in the concept of , we as humans have been the ones creating all this diversity in order to manifest what we are now.

So , there is no one from this heavens understanding what diversity means. We are the only ones that have done the whole path. We are the only ones able to do all this reconstruction , resolving the conflict , because we have created and we know the conflict.

So , it 's only our work to do that. There is no one another dimension in other planet or in the heavens , common to say , I will say to you. We are the only ones that have to do that.

So , what happened next? Unity and duality , diverse and universe.

So , this point here is the one that we are going to call , that we are going to call , adverse. Em , adverse.

So , the universe in order to become diverse will go through the adverse process of losing something from itself , because in order to create the division to manifest something in this reality , the universe must lose something from itself.

So , this is the first conflict that the universe has , which is detachment. From the point of view of diversity in order to find the unity in the universe , we need to go through the conflict in this point of adverse , where two visions must come back to be one together.

So , this point here is the one that we call the conjunction between two different beings. This points are the ones that we call between being , which in Latin , we call , Inter , etc.

So , the point of interest is the adversity that two beings has to face in order to reach one same goal.

So , let 's do it very easy. Person , it and person be , both of them getting loved with person C.

So , these two people has the same point of interest , which is to be together with C.

So , point A and point B will have a conflict and a adversity.

So , in this example , just to have this idea , in this example.

So , usually , in our cultures , we would say , the B and the A should have this argument to be with a person C. And the person C must choose the B or the A or something like that. But in the concept of the universe is really difficult to get to unity , because we have this concept of one or the other. And in the universe , the universe , this would mean that A and B are both together with the C.

So , they find the balance and they do n't have an adversity that would be a way , for example. In the point of view of the universe , the person C , yes , divides itself to choose one of these two. The same thing could happen in countries , for example.

So , there is country A and country B , and they are willing to have the same resources in a third country.

So , they start a war.

So , from this point of view , there is no war for one point of interest. From the point of view of the universe , we are creating adversity , cultures , races , different things , countries , etc.

So , from the point of view of the universe , adversity is not something wrong , is something that creates possibilities , that opens the tree to see different options , the manifest things. But going to the unity , we have common interest points that creates conflicts according to our previous preconceptions of that point of interest.

So , the universe , from this point of view , creates options from our point of view of humans , we create wars.

So , from the point of view of the universe , the point of interest is to create an option. From the point of view of the diversity , the point of interest is to control that interest , to control only one option.

So , this is just for us to understand that the universe is not creating conflicts and wars. The universe does n't need that. We are the only ones that create this conflicts and wars , because we want to reach the unity , but we do it through an unconscious way. I guess that 's it for now , because we will talk more about this , because we are still have the month of areas ahead.

So , we will talk about conflict.

So , remember , we are in campychore , and so we are working about talking about the systems of this. In other moments like areas and naming , we will speak about the motions and how we handle them and so on.

So , do n't worry , I am all there today. My face is all with this thing.

## Daily Practice Elements

Okay , the vibration for today is blue. The statement for today is I am the home of the workers. The code for today is axis. Every destiny node , clockwise , into an axis.

For in the cosmic geometry , all nodes have their anti-bodes crossing the center of the figure generated by all the paths and destined , edges and vertices. The modal point where all the central lines connect , the core with the vertices are called axis. And this , are capable of crossing not only the spaces of the path but the times. Being on axis is being having , is being having coherence between the internal , superficial and external between body , so , and sphere past , present and future.

So , let 's go to the line. We see it comfortable , taking the breath , focusing on the breathing. We see it comfortable , taking the breath , focusing on the breathing. We see it comfortable , taking the breath.

We see it comfortable , taking the breath. We see it comfortable , taking the breath. We see it take the breath , pay attention to the environment you find yourself in. And use your imagination to make it darker and darker , like a night for those stars.

We see it comfortable , taking the breath. We see it comfortable , taking the breath. We see it comfortable , taking the breath. In front of me , I perceive a fire with its flames like snakes shining a red and orange , expanding the heat that I feel in my hands , chest and face as I watch the fire deep and straight.

## Q&A

I recognize that I am not alone around the fire , but there are many other people. I recognize these people as those that are linked to me at the conflicts of my life. These people are my conflicts , and all of them are being enlightened by the light of the fire that represents my adversity. I ask myself , are they my enemies?

How do I feel with this conflict with a defeat , the fight , conflict? How am I capable to accept the defeat? Am I capable to transcend those who I call my enemies? Take the breath.

I recognize the fire of the adversity that every conflict that I find in my life was created by me in order to find all the abilities that I have to evolve. To know myself. I am the creator of my own adversity. The only reason why I can not accept this reality is because I am still learning from it.

I take care of all of these enemies , conflicts and universities around me , and I honor them because I am also thinking that I can not see myself. With my hands engraving me , I take the fire of the adversity within me , so this time is not the adversity you see me , but it 's me , myself , you see the adversity as a tool for my own evolution. And I see bringing consciousness to it. I am the creator of my own adversity.

I recognize all of them who are around me. They are workers of existence and all of them find their home within me. I am the home of workers. I use the adversity of all these workers as a tool for our own evolution as one.

I am the creator of my own. I am the creator of my own adversity. I am the creator of my own evolution. I stretch the body , carry the body , expanding this consciousness around my body.

Thank you everybody for being there as always. We see you tomorrow at the same time.
