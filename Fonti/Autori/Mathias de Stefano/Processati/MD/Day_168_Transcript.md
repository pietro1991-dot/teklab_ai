## Overview

On January 18th, Matias explores **Adversities** in relation to the **Knees Chakra**—the energy center that governs our ability to walk through challenges, to move forward despite obstacles, to navigate the difficult terrain of existence. This teaching reveals a profound cosmological truth: **adversities are not accidents or punishments, but the necessary mechanism through which the universe observes itself.**

The word **adverse** shares the same root as **universe** and **diverse**—all coming from **versus** (to turn, to bend, to twist). The **universe** is "the one that turns to itself again," bending its own body back to itself. **Adverse** means "that which goes toward the bending, toward the distortion." **Diverse** means the **multiplicity created by this bending**.

The revolutionary insight: **The universe can only understand unity by dividing itself.** Like a single line that must bend to see both directions, or a sphere that must create light and shadow to perceive itself, **the Everything must become Many to experience the One.** Adversities are the **conflicts, distortions, and challenges** created when the one divides itself to see from different angles.

We are **diverse beings** precisely because the universe needs many viewpoints to understand itself. **Adversity is the path through which we walk back to unity**—not by avoiding challenges, but by **moving through them consciously**.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology: Adverse, Universe, Diverse

To understand adversities, we must start with the **origin of the word**.

**Adverse** and **Universe** have the **same origin**: they both come from **versus**.

**Versus** (Latin) means:
- To turn
- To bend
- To twist
- Toward
- Torsion

**Three words emerge from this root:**

**1. UNIVERSE** = **Uni** (one) + **Versus** (to turn)
- **The one that turns to itself again**
- The one that bends its own body to itself
- The one that comes back again to itself

**2. ADVERSE** = **Ad** (to go to) + **Versus** (to bend/turn)
- **That thing that goes to the direction of bending, of distortion, of turning**
- That which moves toward the twist, toward the conflict

**3. DIVERSE** = **Di** (two, division) + **Versus** (to turn)
- **The multiplicity created by turning and dividing**
- The many created from the one

**Key understanding:** All three words—**universe, adverse, diverse**—describe **the same process of bending, turning, and dividing** to create experience and observation.

### The Universe as One Line

Imagine the **universe is only one line**.

Now, picture this: if we have this being, this one line, as **only one**, there is another way to see it. **We can see it in depth.**

If we see it in depth, we have a **line** extending in one direction.

**The problem:** If this dot here (at the beginning of the line) observes **this direction** (forward), how can it also observe **the other direction** (backward)?

**The solution:** The only way for the dot to see both directions is by **dividing itself into two**.

So the universe **doesn't cut in half—it bends in half.**

**Now I have two eyes.** Two points of observation from the same source.

### The Process of Bending

After the first bending creates a **pattern** (two points observing), the universe doesn't stop there.

**It keeps bending itself** to create more patterns:
- They start to bend again → creating another pattern
- Then bend again → creating another pattern
- And bending and dividing once and again, once and again

**This is what we call the bending of time and space.**

### The Sphere Example

The same thing happens with a **sphere**.

The sphere divides itself in order to **bend to itself**, to see different perceptions of itself.

It creates, for example, **one dark side here** (shadow) and one light side (illuminated).

**But it's not different—it's just one bending to itself.**

The sphere must create **light and shadow, positive and negative, expansion and contraction**—all to observe itself from different angles.

### The Paradox of Unity and Division

**Here is the paradox:**

**Everything is just one**, all the being, trying to **see itself**—the one that it is.

So it tries to bend, to divide, **in order to see the unity**.

**But the paradox is:** As many times as it divides itself, it creates **many more options**. It creates many more distortions and possibilities the more it tries to reach itself.

**The universe starts to create so many options, so many systems**, because **this is the only way it can find the unity, the whole**.

If it doesn't do this path—if it doesn't divide and bend—**it will never become aware of itself**.

**This is why it needs to divide itself in order to be aware of what the unity means.**

### Everything and Nothing

**If the universe doesn't observe itself, everything is nothing.** It doesn't mean anything.

Because **what is the goal of the everything, if it's not being able to experience itself?**

This is why the Everything starts to **divide itself**—so it can:
- **Watch itself**
- **Experience itself**
- **See many other options**
- **Grow**

**The division gives meaning to the Everything.**

Without division, without adversity, without diversity, **everything would be nothing**—because there would be no experience, no observation, no awareness.

### The Universe Bends to Create Adversity

So remember: **What is the universe?**

**The universe is only one being that divides itself so it can see another option of itself.**

It starts to **bend**.

**Here, the universe (the One) divides itself and turns itself to another direction**—going away from the unity, going toward the **duality**.

**And that's what we call ADVERSE.**

**Adverse is the system, the direction to where the universe goes.**

It's not bad. It's not evil. It's not wrong.

**Adverse is simply the mechanism through which the One becomes Two, so it can observe itself and eventually return to knowing the One.**

### From Universe to Adverse to Diverse

**The sequence:**

1. **Universe** = Unity, the One
2. **Adverse** = The bending, the conflict, the challenge, the distortion that creates duality
3. **Diverse** = The multiplicity, the many options created by continuous bending

**Unity** (Universe) → **Duality** (Adverse) → **Multiplicity** (Diverse)

**We are diverse beings.** We are the **many created from the One** through the process of **bending and adversity**.

### Why Are We Diverse Beings?

**Why are we diverse beings?**

Because **the universe needs many viewpoints to understand itself.**

If there were only one being, one perspective, one experience, **the universe could never know itself fully**.

**Diversity is not a problem to solve—it's the solution to observation.**

Every single being, every single perspective, every single experience is **one more angle from which the universe observes itself**.

**You are not separate from the universe.** You are **the universe observing itself from this particular angle, through this particular bending**.

### Adversities as the Path

Now we come to the core understanding of **adversities**.

**Adversities are the conflicts, challenges, distortions, and difficulties** that arise when:
- The One divides into Two
- The Two bend into Many
- Different viewpoints encounter each other
- Different directions meet and clash

**Adversities are not accidents.** They are **the natural result of the universe bending itself** to create diverse perspectives.

When you face adversity—conflict, challenge, suffering, obstacle—**you are experiencing the bending of the universe**.

You are standing at the **point of tension** where different directions meet, where different perspectives clash, where the unity is trying to observe itself through contrast.

### The Knees: Walking Through Adversity

The **Knees Chakra** is about **walking**—moving forward, navigating terrain, bending to adapt to the path.

**Knees allow us to:**
- Bend and flex
- Absorb impact
- Navigate obstacles
- Keep moving despite challenges
- Walk through difficult terrain

**This is why adversities are related to the Knees.**

**Adversity is not about standing still or giving up.** It's about **walking through the challenge**, bending as needed, adapting to the terrain, and **continuing forward**.

**"I Am the Home of Walkers"** means:
- You are the space through which walkers (souls navigating adversity) move
- You are the ground that holds those who walk through challenges
- You are the path itself through which the universe walks back to unity

### Adversity as Creation, Not Destruction

**Critical understanding:** Adversity is **not destruction**—it's **creation**.

Every time the universe bends, every time it creates conflict and challenge, **it's creating new possibilities for observation and experience**.

**Without adversity:**
- No growth
- No learning
- No expansion
- No experience
- No meaning

**With adversity:**
- New perspectives emerge
- New solutions are discovered
- New strength is developed
- New awareness is created
- The universe knows itself more fully

**Adversity is the creative force** through which the One discovers what it means to be Many, and through which the Many discover they are One.

### The Bending of Time and Space

Matias mentions **"the bending of time and space"**—this is not just a metaphor.

When the universe bends itself:
- **Space** bends (creating distance, separation, different locations)
- **Time** bends (creating past, present, future, sequence, causality)

**Adversities bend our experience of time and space:**
- Challenges make time feel slow or fast
- Difficulties make space feel vast or constricting
- Conflicts distort our perception of distance and duration

**But this bending is how we navigate reality.** Without the bending of time and space, there would be no journey, no path, no walking through experience.

### The Logic of Division to Understand Unity

Matias emphasizes this seems **illogical, but it's actually logical**:

**"The Everything, to understand the Everything, needs to divide."**

This is the fundamental logic of existence:
- **Unity can only know itself through duality**
- **The whole can only understand itself through parts**
- **The One can only experience itself through the Many**

**You cannot know light without darkness.** You cannot know unity without division. You cannot know the Everything without experiencing the Many.

**Division is not the opposite of unity—it's the path to understanding unity.**

### What Does This Mean for Our Lives?

When you face **adversity** in your life:
- A conflict with someone
- A challenge in your work
- A difficulty in your path
- A painful experience
- An obstacle you can't avoid

**Remember:** This is **the universe bending itself** to observe itself from a new angle.

**You are not being punished.** You are not cursed. You are not unlucky.

**You are experiencing the natural process** through which the One becomes aware of itself by creating contrast, challenge, and different perspectives.

**The question is not:** "How do I avoid adversity?"

**The question is:** "How do I walk through this adversity consciously, knowing it's part of the universe's process of self-discovery?"

## Practice

### Meditation on Adversity and Unity

**Setup:** Sit comfortably, close your eyes, take deep breaths.

**Part 1: Recognize the One**

1. **Imagine the universe as one single point**—pure unity, pure being, everything in one.

2. **Feel this oneness** in your heart, in your body, in your awareness.

3. **Ask:** How can this one point observe itself? How can it know itself?

**Part 2: Watch the Bending**

4. **See this one point begin to divide**—not cutting, but bending, creating two points of observation.

5. **Watch as it bends again and again**—creating patterns, creating options, creating diversity.

6. **Recognize:** Every bending creates adversity (the tension of going in different directions) and diversity (the many perspectives created).

**Part 3: Find Yourself in the Bending**

7. **Recognize:** You are one of these bending points. You are **the universe observing itself from this angle**.

8. **See the adversities in your life** as the **points where different bendings meet**—where different perspectives clash, where the universe is trying to see itself from multiple angles simultaneously.

9. **Feel your Knees Chakra** activating—your ability to **walk through these bendings**, to navigate the terrain of adversity.

**Part 4: Affirm Unity Through Diversity**

10. **Affirm:** **"I Am the Home of Walkers"**
    - You are the space through which the universe walks back to itself
    - You are the path through which adversity becomes experience
    - You are the ground that holds all walkers on their journey

11. **Recognize:** Every adversity you face is **the universe bending to know itself better**.

12. **Choose:** Will you resist the bending (creating more suffering), or will you **walk through it consciously** (creating more awareness)?

**Closing:**

13. **Breathe deeply** and return to the present moment.

14. **Stand if you're able** and feel your knees—these joints that allow you to bend, to walk, to navigate the path.

15. **Take one step forward**, consciously, knowing you are **walking through the adversity of existence**, carrying the universe's process of self-discovery in every movement.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Throughout the day, when you encounter adversity:**

1. **Pause and recognize:** "This is the universe bending itself."

2. **Ask yourself:**
   - What two (or more) perspectives are clashing here?
   - What is the universe trying to observe through this conflict?
   - What angle of itself is being revealed through this challenge?

3. **Feel your Knees Chakra:**
   - Can you bend and adapt without breaking?
   - Can you walk through this adversity consciously?
   - Can you navigate this terrain with awareness?

4. **Affirm:** "I Am the Home of Walkers—I walk through this consciously, knowing it's part of the universe's path to self-discovery."

5. **Move forward** with one conscious step, one bend, one navigation of the obstacle.

### Applying This Teaching

- **Stop seeing adversity as punishment** and start seeing it as **the natural process of universal self-observation**
- **When conflicts arise**, recognize them as **different bendings meeting**—the universe trying to see itself from multiple angles
- **Use your Knees** (literally and metaphorically) to **walk through challenges** rather than resist them
- **Embrace diversity** as the necessary multiplicity created by the universe's bending
- **Remember:** You are not separate from this process—you ARE the universe bending and observing itself

### Capricorn Emotional Week

This teaching helps us understand **how we use** the emotional experience of adversity. Capricorn asks: **"What is this useful for?"**

**Adversity is useful for:**
- Creating diverse perspectives
- Allowing the universe to observe itself
- Generating growth through challenge
- Walking the path back to unity through the experience of duality

**We don't avoid adversity—we walk through it consciously, using it as the path it was meant to be.**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: Why do adverse, universe, and diverse all come from the same root word?

Because they all describe **the same cosmological process**: the universe (**uni-versus** = the one that turns to itself) creates **adversity** (**ad-versus** = going toward the bending/conflict) which generates **diversity** (**di-versus** = the multiplicity created by division). All three are stages of the **universe bending itself to observe itself from different angles**.

### Q: How can the universe only understand unity by dividing itself?

Because **observation requires perspective, and perspective requires division**. A single point cannot observe itself—it has no angle, no distance, no contrast. Like an eye that cannot see itself without a mirror, **the One must become Two (or Many) to observe the One**. Unity can only be **known through the experience of duality and the journey back to wholeness**.

### Q: If adversity is natural and necessary, does that mean we should seek suffering?

No. **Adversity is inevitable as part of the universe's process, but suffering is optional**. Suffering arises when we **resist** the bending, when we fight against the natural process, when we refuse to walk through the challenge. **Conscious navigation of adversity** (walking through it with awareness) creates growth and meaning; **unconscious resistance** creates suffering and stagnation.

### Q: What does "I Am the Home of Walkers" mean?

You are the **space, the ground, the path** through which **walkers** (souls navigating existence) move through adversity. You are not just **a** walker—you are the **home** that holds all walkers, the terrain that supports the journey, the path itself through which the universe walks back to unity. You are both **the journey and the journeyer**.

### Q: How does this teaching relate to the Knees Chakra?

The **Knees** are the joints that allow us to **bend, flex, and walk** through terrain. They absorb impact, navigate obstacles, and keep us moving forward. **Adversity requires the same qualities**: the ability to bend without breaking, to flex and adapt, to keep walking through challenges. The Knees Chakra governs our **capacity to navigate the adverse path consciously** rather than collapse or give up.

### Q: If diversity is created by the universe bending, does that mean diversity is conflict?

Not exactly. **Diversity is the result of bending** (creating multiple perspectives), and **adversity is the tension that arises when different perspectives meet**. Diversity itself is neutral—it's simply **multiplicity**. But when different perspectives encounter each other, **adversity (conflict, challenge, contrast) naturally arises**. This is not bad; it's **the mechanism through which the universe learns about itself**.

### Q: How can I walk through adversity consciously?

1. **Recognize the bending:** See the challenge as the universe creating different angles of observation
2. **Feel your Knees:** Activate your ability to bend, flex, and navigate
3. **Don't resist:** Fighting the bending creates suffering; accepting it creates growth
4. **Take one conscious step:** Move forward through the adversity with awareness
5. **Remember unity:** Know that the Many are always returning to the One—adversity is the path, not the destination

### Q: What's the difference between avoiding adversity and walking through it consciously?

**Avoiding adversity** = Trying to stay as the undivided One, refusing to bend, resisting the universe's natural process (creates stagnation and eventual collapse)

**Walking through adversity consciously** = Recognizing you are part of the universe's bending process, flexing with the challenge, navigating the terrain with awareness, using the Knees to move forward (creates growth, meaning, and eventual return to unity with greater awareness)

**You cannot avoid the bending—but you can choose to walk through it consciously rather than resist it unconsciously.**
