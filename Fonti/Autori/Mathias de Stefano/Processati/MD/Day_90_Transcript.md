# Day 90 - Here and Now

## Overview

Today connects with torus chakra (whole body) in Libra Physical Week, closing Physical Week and entire Libra month. Torus represents whole duality—complete circuit of balance pairs we've explored.

Last night in Egypt, something beautiful happened. Water library (place where we aligned pyramids, channeled energy) received blessing: rain. In desert, rain is rare, sacred. After all our work aligning pyramids, sky opened, blessed land.

This is sign. When you do work aligning energy, nature responds. Water came to library—knowledge flowing back to Earth.

Today is November 1. Scorpio begins tomorrow. Physical Week ends today with teaching on here and now—most misunderstood concept in spirituality.

People say "be present," "live in now," "be here now." But they don't understand what here and now actually mean. Here is not place. Now is not moment. Here and now are eternity—all times, all spaces, all at once.

This is closing teaching for Physical Week. Let me explain.

## Core Teaching

### Time and Space: Same Thing

First, understand: time and space are same thing. They're not separate.

Time is measurement of space moving. Space is measurement of time existing. They're two ways to describe same thing: pull, strings pulling reality into form.

When you say "time passes," you mean space is moving through your perception. When you say "I'm in space," you mean time is flowing through your experience.

Human perception divides them (time vs. space), but cosmic reality unites them (time-space continuum). They're one thing—pull creating reality.

### Human Perception vs. Cosmic Reality

From human perspective, you perceive: day passes, night comes, constellations move across sky, seasons change. You think: time is passing, I'm moving through time.

But cosmic reality is opposite. You're not moving through time. Earth is moving through space. Sun isn't rising—Earth is rotating. Constellations aren't moving—you're spinning.

What you call "time passing" is actually space moving. What you call "being in moment" is actually being in specific point of space-time continuum.

When you understand this, concept of "now" changes completely.

### "Now" Is Not Moment—It's All Times

People say "live in now," thinking now is this moment—this second, this breath, this instant.

But now is not moment. Now is all moments at once.

When you're truly in now, you're not in this moment excluding others. You're in eternity—all times happening simultaneously.

This is what "I Am" means. I Am is not "I am in this moment." I Am is "I exist in all moments." Present tense not because it's this moment, but because it's eternal moment containing all moments.

### "Here" Is Not Place—It's All Spaces

Same with here. People think here means this location—this room, this body, this planet.

But here is not place. Here is all places at once.

When you're truly here, you're not in this location excluding others. You're in totality—all spaces existing simultaneously.

This is why God said to Moses: "I Am who I Am." Not "I am in this place" or "I am in this time." I Am—all times, all spaces, eternal presence.

### Pressentism vs. True Here/Now

There's difference between pressentism (living in present ego) and true here/now (living in eternal I Am).

Pressentism is when you say: "I only care about this moment. Past doesn't matter, future doesn't matter. Only now exists."

This is ego. This is forgetting responsibility.

True here/now is when you say: "I Am in all moments. Past affects now, now affects future. I'm responsible for all times/spaces because I exist in all of them."

Pressentism is escaping. True here/now is embracing totality.

### Time Doesn't Exist—Only Perception from Matter

Here's deeper truth: time doesn't exist. It's perception created by matter.

When you're in body (matter), you perceive time passing because matter moves through space. But when you're consciousness (spirit), there's no time—only eternal now containing all moments.

Time is tool matter uses to experience space. Without matter, no time. Only eternity.

This is why when you die (leave matter), time stops. You enter eternal now where all moments exist simultaneously.

### Space Is Construction of Energy

Same with space. Space doesn't exist objectively. It's construction of energy organizing into atoms, vibrations creating perception of distance.

What you call "space between us" is actually energy vibrating at different frequencies creating perception of separation.

Without energy organizing into matter, no space. Only totality—everything touching everything.

### I Am Who I Am: Only Name for God

Moses asked God: "What is your name?" God answered: "I Am who I Am."

This is only name for God because God is not thing in time/space. God is time-space itself. God is eternal now, total here—all moments, all places, all at once.

When you say "I Am," you're saying God's name. You're declaring: I exist in all times, all spaces, eternal presence.

This is not ego. This is truth. You are not separate from God. You are expression of I Am experiencing itself through your perspective.

### God Etymology: Geo/Sun/Light

Word God comes from different roots depending on language.

In some, it comes from geo—Earth, ground, foundation. God as ground of being.

In Greek, theos comes from Zeus—sky god, sun, light. God as light, consciousness.

Both point to same thing: God is foundation (Earth, matter) and consciousness (sun, light). God is time-space continuum experiencing itself through matter and consciousness.

Not external being creating universe. But universe itself—conscious, alive, experiencing.

### Responsibility of Here/Now Means All Times/Spaces

When you understand here/now as all times/spaces, responsibility changes.

You're not just responsible for this moment, this action. You're responsible for all moments—past (ancestors you affect), future (descendants you affect), now (everyone you touch).

You're not just responsible for this place, this body. You're responsible for all places—Earth, cosmos, all beings sharing space-time with you.

This is heavy. This is beautiful. This is true here/now.

### Closing Physical Week: Toroidal Circuit Complete

Physical Week explored body through balance pairs: Logic/Illogic, Real/Illusion, Silence/Sound, Saving/Losing, Food/Fast, Health/Disease, Sociality/Sexuality, Life/Death, Center/Periphery, Here/Now.

Each pair showed: physical reality is duality balanced. Crown to torus, circuit complete.

You've learned: body is tool for spirit to experience creation, perception creates reality, everything is mind/energy/observation, death is transformation, God is I Am.

Tomorrow, Scorpio begins. New constellation, new teachings. But today, honor toroidal circuit—whole body balanced.

## Practice: Torus Chakra Activation (Whole Body)

**Preparation:**
- Comfortable position
- Stretch body, massage, warm
- Let weight fall, relax, focus breathing

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation sequence

**Torus Work (Whole Body Balance):**

19. Pay attention to higher self above you
20. Help descend through all chakras: crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacral, root, knees, ankles—whole body
21. Perceive body as torus: energy flowing from crown down front, up back, creating circuit
22. Feel duality in each part: left/right (logic/illogic), front/back (real/illusion), inside/outside (silence/sound)
23. Recognize: your body is mirror of all balance pairs taught this week
24. With both hands, massage whole body (head to feet, acknowledge each portal)
25. Thank body for being vehicle through which spirit experiences creation

**Integration:**

26. Relax hands, allow perceive whole body as one organism
27. Vibrate: SSvarious (different sounds for different chakras—let intuition guide)
28. State: "I am eternal evolution" (repeat)
29. Feel yourself in all times (past/present/future), all spaces (here/there/everywhere)
30. Declare: "I Am who I Am"—eternal presence, total here/now
31. Honor Physical Week complete, Scorpio beginning tomorrow
32. Stretch, warm, massage throughout all portals of joints
33. Return here now, open eyes

**Closing:** Drink lots of water, rest to assimilate. Water library blessed us with rain—knowledge flowing back to Earth. You blessed Earth with your presence—eternal I Am experiencing creation.

## Integration

**Daily:** When you say "I Am," remember: you're declaring eternal presence in all times/spaces. Not ego—truth.

**Weekly:** Torus chakra practice, massage whole body. Feel toroidal circuit—energy flowing crown to feet, balancing all dualities.

**Monthly:** Identify one area where you practice pressentism (escaping to "now" to avoid responsibility). How can you embrace true here/now (all times/spaces)?

**Ongoing:** Remember: time/space are one thing. "Now" is eternity. "Here" is totality. You're responsible for all moments, all places. This is I Am who I Am.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If "now" is all moments, how do I live practically?**
A: You still act in this moment, but with awareness: what you do now affects all times (past through ancestors, future through consequences). Presence isn't ignoring time—it's honoring totality.

**Q: Why is pressentism (living in present) wrong?**
A: It's not wrong—it's incomplete. True presence isn't escaping past/future. It's being in all times at once, recognizing responsibility for all moments.

**Q: If time doesn't exist, why do I experience it?**
A: You're in matter (body). Matter moves through space, creating perception of time. When you leave matter (death, deep meditation), time stops. You enter eternal now.

**Q: How can I be in all spaces if I'm in this body?**
A: Your consciousness isn't limited to body. Body is one point where you're focused, but consciousness extends to all spaces. Practice: feel beyond body.

**Q: What's difference between "I Am" and ego saying "I am"?**
A: Ego says "I am this" (identity, separation). True I Am says "I Am" (no identity, eternal presence). One limits, one liberates.

**Q: If God is I Am, does that mean I'm God?**
A: You're expression of I Am. God is not separate being—God is eternal presence (all times/spaces). You are that, experiencing itself through your perspective.

**Q: How does responsibility for all times/spaces work?**
A: What you do now affects ancestors (honoring/dishonoring lineage), affects descendants (creating patterns they inherit), affects all beings sharing space-time (energy you put out touches all).

**Q: Why did water library receive rain after pyramid alignment?**
A: When you align energy (spiritual work), nature responds (physical manifestation). Rain in desert after alignment shows: spirit and matter connected. Your work blesses Earth.

## Closing Reflection

Today closes Physical Week, closes Libra month, closes ten balance pairs exploring physical reality. Crown to torus, circuit complete.

Here and now are most misunderstood teachings. People think: here is place, now is moment, be present in this instant. But that's pressentism—ego escaping responsibility.

True here/now is eternity, totality. Here is all spaces. Now is all times. When you're truly present, you're not in this moment excluding others—you're in I Am who I Am, eternal presence containing all moments.

Time and space are one thing—pull creating reality. Human perception divides them, cosmic reality unites them. "Time passing" is space moving. "Being in moment" is being in specific point of time-space continuum.

Time doesn't exist objectively—it's perception matter creates. Space doesn't exist objectively—it's energy organizing into atoms. Without matter, no time or space. Only eternal now, total here—everything touching everything, all moments simultaneous.

I Am who I Am is only name for God because God is not thing in time/space. God is time-space itself—eternal now, total here. When you say "I Am," you're saying God's name. Not ego. Truth. You are expression of eternal presence experiencing itself.

Responsibility of here/now means all times/spaces. You affect ancestors through honoring lineage. You affect descendants through patterns you create. You affect all beings through energy you put out. Heavy, beautiful, true.

Water library blessed us with rain after pyramid alignment. When you do spiritual work, nature responds. Your presence blesses Earth.

Tomorrow, Scorpio begins. New constellation, deeper teachings. But today, honor: you are eternal evolution. You completed Physical Week—ten balance pairs teaching body is tool for spirit, perception creates reality, duality is balance.

You are I Am who I Am when you recognize: here is totality, now is eternity, you exist in all times and spaces, responsible for all, eternal presence experiencing creation through your unique perspective.

That's the teaching. That's Physical Week complete. That's who you are.
