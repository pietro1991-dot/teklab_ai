## Overview

Today we arrive at the third eye chakra of the Mental Week of Aries, and our topic is the question **Why?**

Yesterday we explored "What?"—the question that describes the object of our inquiry. Today we ask "Why?"—the question that takes us to the origin of all things.

"Why?" is the key to awareness, the question that leads us back through the spiral of time to find the root cause of everything we experience.

---

## Etymology of "Why"

### From European Roots

The question "Why" comes from the European language, just like yesterday's "What."

Yesterday, we learned that "What" comes from **quo** meaning "object."

Today, "Why" comes from **qui**, which in European language is the one that determines the **cause** of something.

### Cause and Reason

**Qui** speaks about the **reason** and **cause**—the origin of why something is happening to this thing.

- **Quo** (What) = the thing, the object
- **Qui** (Why) = the reason, the cause of what's happening to the object

### Why Takes Us to the Origin

The question "Why?" takes us to the **origin** of all things, to the beginning of every reality we know.

All things that exist today have an origin, have a reason for existence. The question "Why?" is the one that helps us find out all these origins.

---

## The Importance of Questioning Why

### Understanding What Made Us Who We Are

The importance of questioning ourselves "Why?" is to understand the origin of the things that made us be what we are today.

In our cultures today, we have been designed to think towards the future because in our third dimension, we know it's impossible to go back to the past or transform the past.

### The Cultural Drive Forward

Because of this, we often say:
- We don't have to care about the past
- We have to create the future
- We have to move forward
- Put all our will and strength into the future

This is why we are constantly thinking ahead, trying to escape from the past.

### Escaping the Past Creates Repetition

Many of us try to deny the past, to go away from it, in order to transform ourselves into something better.

We understand the past like an anchor, something that doesn't help us move forward.

But by your own experience, you can tell: **the faster you run to the future escaping from the past, the faster you will live exactly the same mistakes as before.**

---

## Time as a Spiral, Not a Line

### The Linear View

In our society's point of view, we go from the past to the future, and we are in the present moving ahead towards the future.

We cannot go back to the past, so we have to let it go, erase the weight of the past.

### The Fourth Dimensional View

When we leave the third dimension towards the fourth dimension, we understand that time is much more like a **spiral** than a line.

This means that **we can never leave the past behind**. It is literally impossible.

### The Structure of Repetition

The past is the structure of repetition.

The past is this turn here, and then this turn here, and this turn here, repeating in spirals.

The past repeats itself constantly—maybe in another level of vibration, another level of consciousness, but it repeats once and again.

### Same Structure, Different Subjects

Perhaps the subjects are different, perhaps the environment is different, but the **structure is the same**.

The base, the structure, is always a circle. Maybe the circle is located differently, but it will still be the same.

---

## The Example of Generational Patterns

### Grandfather, Father, Son

The system: grandfather → father → son

My grandfather was also a son of someone.
My grandfather was a father of someone.
My grandfather was a grandfather of someone.

The system repeats, but the people have different names, living in different countries.

The **environment and subjects are different**, but the **system is the same**. It's continuous, it's constant.

---

## The Loop of Time

### We Always Come Back to the Beginning

This structure tells me that no matter what I do in my life, somewhere or somehow, I will come back to the beginning.

And I keep moving into the next one, and the next one, and the next one.

Everything I do has a system that works in a loop.

### The System Works the Same

This system works exactly the same whether we are in the subconscious, unconscious, or conscience. It doesn't matter—it doesn't change. This is how it is.

The only thing that really changes is **my attitude** according to this structure.

---

## Finding the Origin of the Loop

### When Things Don't Make Sense

When we are living in one of these circles doing things, and suddenly we start to experience things we don't understand—we don't understand the reason why they are good or bad for us—the question we start to ask is:

**Why? Why?**

### Why Helps Find the Origin

The question "Why?" is the one that helps me find the **origin of this constant loop**.

Imagine I am here in this point of the process and I say: "Why am I here? Why am I living this?"

The question immediately will take me to the first one, the one before myself, to see it. Here is the cause.

Then I ask "Why?" and I go to the next one before.

"Why?" goes to the next one, and so on.

The question "Why?" takes me to the origin of this system.

---

## Consciousness and Questions

### The Unconscious Doesn't Question

The one that is unconscious doesn't make questions.

The only one that makes questions is the one that is conscious.

### The Conscious Has Questions, Not Answers

The one that is conscious doesn't have the answers—they have all the questions.

Why? Because the one that is unconscious is living through the waves of others, moved by the positive and negative, trying to sail between the currents of society, of ideas, living through the concepts of others.

### Awakening Begins with "Why?"

When we start the path of consciousness, for sure you all have been through this—the first question you ask is: **Why?**

---

## The Paradox of Awakening

### Why Do We Think the Awakened Have All the Answers?

If "Why?" is the key to awareness, why do we think that the one who is conscious has all the answers and no need to ask "Why?" again?

Let me repeat the question because even I couldn't fully get it the first time:

**Why, if the question "Why?" is the key for awareness, are we thinking that the one that is awakened has all the answers and doesn't have any reason to ask "Why?" again?**

### The Key of Consciousness

The key of being conscious is **not** to believe that we have the answers to all the origins.

The key of consciousness is to **keep asking "Why?"**

The question "Why?" is the one that takes us to the origin, to the initiation, to the main energy, the inertia that moves us forward in order to exist and create.

---

## The Universe's Only Answer

### Why Not?

The universe only has one possible answer for the question "Why?"

Do you know which one it is?

The ultimate question of the universe to the question "Why?" is:

**Why not?**

Simple. This is another question.

### Questions Are the Origin

As we have said, questions are the origin of things. The question is the origin of consciousness.

The one that is following consciousness knows exactly that in order to love the answers, you must love the question even more.

The wise one knows that the question is the key.

There's no answer that is bigger than the question.

---

## Nobody Has the Right Answer

### The Key to Understand

The key to understand for this week, and even more today, is this:

**Nobody has the right answer. Nobody has the only answer to anything.**

Because the only possible answer is the question.

So you have to keep questioning everything.

---

## Two Ways of Asking

### Questioning from the Ego

When we question through the ego, we are fighting to achieve the answer.

We are judging the other one because we want to put our truth over the others.

When you question through the ego, the only thing you can create in the other one is a **reaction** to defend their answer, instead of making them doubt and ask a new question.

#### Example from the Ego

"Why do you do it this way?"

This pushes the other to defend: "Because I..."

### Questioning from the Being

When you question from the being, you question in a way that invites the other person to see a different way, inviting them to make another question, to doubt, to look for a better answer.

#### Example from the Being

"Why do you think you do it in this way?"

You see the difference?

It's the same question.

The first one goes against the ego.

The second one invites the ego to look for a better answer.

---

## The Practice: Questioning "Why"

### The Task for Today

Take your notebook and write down all the "Why?" questions of your life.

Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why this? Why that? Why this?

### Only Questions, No Answers

There's no need to answer. Just write the questions.

Ask yourself:
- Why do I believe this?
- Why do I think this way?
- Why do I say these things?
- Why do I feel this?
- Why am I the way I am?
- Why do I do what I do?
- Why do I have what I have?
- Why am I looking for what I'm looking for?
- Why am I on this path?

### Keep Asking

The question "Why?" is infinite. It can always go deeper, always find another origin behind the origin.

Perhaps it seems silly at the beginning, but learning how to question "Why?" opens many different possibilities instead of wasting energy on the fight.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on your breathing.

### Crown Chakra

Become aware of the room you're in, the body you're in, and your breathing.

Visualize above you a tiny light, a spark—your divine spark.

The light of the "I Am."

Expand it. Feel this spark coming down to your crown chakra and igniting.

Ask the question: **Why do I believe?**

Breathe and ignite this spark.

### Third Eye

Feel this spark falling down after this explosion, shining in the center of your brain, expanding its light.

By seeing the expansion of this spark, activate the question: **Why do I observe?**

Observe the expansion and explosion of this divine spark.

### Throat

Breathe. Descend this divine spark to your throat. Ignite its light within you.

Activate the question: **Why do I say? Why do I speak?**

Ignite the divine spark through the question.

### Heart

Descend this spark to your heart.

With every breath, this divine spark starts to ignite in many others, to every direction through your heart.

Activate the question: **Why do I feel what I feel?**

### Solar Plexus

Take a deep breath and descend this divine spark to your solar plexus.

With every breath, feel how this spark ignites within you, activating the spark of your being.

Activate the question: **Why am I as I am?**

### Sacral

Descend this divine spark to the sacral chakra.

Observe the light igniting within you.

In this light, activate the question: **Why do I do what I do?**

### Root

Take a deep breath and descend this spark to your root chakra.

See, feel this spark expanding in many sparks through your genitals and hips.

In its light, activate the question: **Why do I have what I have?**

Ignite.

### Knees

Take a deep breath, descending this divine spark towards your knees.

Feel the light of these sparks igniting along your legs.

Activate the question in you: **Why do I look for what I'm looking for?**

Ignite.

### Ankles

Take a deep breath and descend this divine spark towards your feet, into your ankles.

Observe the divine spark activating its light within you.

Activate the question: **Why am I going on this path?**

### Integration

Start to see all these divine sparks in you expanding towards the outside, igniting the light in you.

Activating the question that leads you to the origin of all things: **Why?**

And in its answer, you can contemplate everything: **Why not?**

Sound: **Gae**

**I am the vision that contemplates. I am the vision that contemplates. I am the vision that contemplates.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Each one at your own time, come back here and now.

Stretch and yawn.

- The universe's only answer to "Why?" is "Why not?"—another question.
- There is no answer bigger than the question itself.
- Nobody has the right answer because the only answer is the question.
- Questioning from the ego creates defensiveness; questioning from the being creates growth.

---

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Throughout today, notice when you avoid asking "Why?" because you're afraid of the answer.

Ask anyway. The question itself opens the door, even if you never find the "final" answer.

### Observing Patterns

Notice where patterns repeat in your life:
- Same relationship dynamics with different people
- Same career challenges in different jobs
- Same emotional reactions in different situations

Ask: "Why does this pattern exist?" and let the question take you back through the spiral to find the origin.

### Inviting Others to Question

When someone asks you for advice, instead of giving answers, ask them questions that invite them to explore:
- "Why do you think that's happening?"
- "Why do you believe that's true?"
- "Why do you want that?"

Help them find their own origins.

## Week Context

We are in the Mental Week of Aries, exploring the questions that initiate consciousness.

Yesterday: "What?" (the object of inquiry)
Today: "Why?" (the cause and origin)
Tomorrow: "What for?" (the purpose and future)

Each question builds on the last, creating a complete picture of conscious inquiry.

---

## Q&A

### Q: If the past repeats, does that mean we're stuck?

No. The structure repeats, but your consciousness within it can change. When you understand the origin (through "Why?"), you can respond differently, creating a new spiral at a different level of awareness.

### Q: How do I know if I'm asking "Why?" from the ego or from the being?

Ego "Why?" feels aggressive, defensive, like you're trying to prove a point. Being "Why?" feels curious, open, genuinely exploring without attachment to the answer.

### Q: If there's no final answer, what's the point of asking?

The question itself is the point. Each "Why?" opens new understanding, new possibilities, new consciousness. The journey is the destination.

### Q: How far back should I go with "Why?"

Until you reach a place where you can only answer "Why not?" That's when you've reached the eternal origin—the point where causality begins simply because it can.

### Q: Doesn't constantly questioning make it impossible to take action?

No. You can act while still questioning. In fact, conscious action comes from questioning, not from assuming you already know. Ask "Why?" and then act based on what you discover.

### Q: What if my "Why?" questions lead to painful realizations?

That's often where the most important origins are found. The pain indicates you're touching something real, something that needs to be seen. Keep asking.

### Q: How is this different from overthinking or analysis paralysis?

Overthinking tries to find the "right" answer and gets stuck. This practice asks "Why?" and moves forward, knowing the question is more important than any single answer.
