## Overview

Today Matias teaches from a place of vulnerability: he shares that he's dealing with hemorrhoids, a physical manifestation of cellular memory trauma from Egypt being processed through his body. With characteristic humor, he notes, "I don't know how many times you have seen a person teaching spiritual consciousness with hemorrhoids on YouTube." This transparency demonstrates the teaching—our bodies hold ancient information that surfaces when we're ready to heal it.

The second day of the Physical Week explores vision and the third eye chakra. While yesterday we learned how smell connects us to spirit through breath, today we discover how sight connects us to intelligence—not the mental cleverness we usually think of, but the deeper capacity to "read between the lines" of reality.

True intelligence is not about accumulating information or solving puzzles. The word "intelligence" comes from Latin *inter* (between) and *legere* (to read), meaning "to read between." This reveals that intelligence is the ability to interpret the hidden meanings, the subconscious data, the 70% of perception happening in our peripheral vision that we never consciously notice.

This teaching explores the three levels of consciousness—subconscious, unconscious, and conscious—and how awakening means going within to access inner sight rather than constantly projecting our awareness outward onto others.

## Core Teaching

### The Evolution of Sight

To understand what vision truly is, we must trace how eyes evolved from the beginning of biological life on Earth.

In the very beginning, the first living organisms had no eyes. They perceived their environment through **touch**—the most fundamental sense. When a single-celled organism encountered something, it felt the physical contact and responded.

Over millions of years, some cells developed **photosensitive areas**—regions that could detect light versus darkness. This was not yet "seeing" in the way we understand it, but it was the beginning. These organisms could sense when light was present and move toward or away from it for survival.

Then came the development of simple **light-detecting organs**—clusters of photosensitive cells that could determine not just light/dark but the direction light was coming from. This allowed more sophisticated movement and navigation.

Eventually, these organs evolved into **primitive eyes** that could detect shapes and movement. Predators and prey both benefited from this development, creating an evolutionary arms race that refined vision over millions of years.

The next major leap was **color perception**. Instead of seeing only shapes and movement in monochrome, organisms developed the ability to see the spectrum of light—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and all shades between. This exponentially increased the data available from the environment.

But the final evolution of sight was not a physical change—it was cognitive. It was the development of **intelligence**: the ability to interpret what is seen, to read between the lines of visual data, to understand concepts behind surface appearances.

This is where humans became unique: not because we see better than other animals (many see far better than us), but because we developed the capacity to **interpret what we see symbolically and conceptually**.

### Intelligence: Reading Between the Lines

The word "intelligence" holds its own teaching. It comes from two Latin roots:

- **Inter** = between
- **Legere** = to read

Intelligence literally means **"to read between."** To read between what? To read between the lines. To read between the surface appearance and the hidden meaning. To read between what is shown and what is implied.

This is why true intelligence is not about memorization or calculation. Those are useful tools, but they are not intelligence itself. Intelligence is the capacity to perceive the concepts, patterns, and meanings that exist in the space between obvious data points.

When you look at a person's face, you don't just see eyes, nose, mouth, skin. You read emotion, intention, honesty, fatigue, joy—none of which are literally visible. You are reading between the lines of their physical appearance to access deeper information.

This reading-between-the-lines happens mostly **subconsciously**. Your conscious mind is not calculating "eyebrow position + lip tension + pupil dilation = sadness." Your subconscious reads the pattern instantly and delivers the interpretation to consciousness as a feeling: "This person is sad."

Intelligence, then, is the cooperation between the conscious and subconscious minds to interpret reality beyond its surface presentation.

### The Three Levels of Consciousness and Perception

To understand how vision truly works, we must understand that we perceive reality through three different levels of consciousness simultaneously:

#### The Subconscious (70% of Perception)

The subconscious absorbs **approximately 70% of all the data you encounter every moment**. This is the largest portion of your perception, yet it operates completely outside your conscious awareness.

Why does the subconscious exist? To save energy. If your conscious mind had to process every single piece of visual data—every color shade, every movement, every texture, every light change—you would be overwhelmed and paralyzed. You couldn't function.

So the subconscious acts as a filter and storage system. It takes in everything happening in your **peripheral vision**—all the data at the edges of your awareness that you're not directly focusing on. It stores this data and processes patterns, only alerting the conscious mind when something important appears.

The subconscious holds **all the clues to wisdom**. All the information you need to understand yourself and your reality is already stored there, perceived but not yet consciously recognized.

This is why awakening consciousness is not about gaining new information from outside—it's about accessing the data you've already collected in your subconscious. It's about looking within, using inner vision to read what your peripheral perception has been recording all along.

#### The Unconscious (Cultural and Language Data)

The unconscious stores cultural programming, language structures, social conditioning, and inherited patterns from your family and society.

This level processes and stores the rules of reality that you absorbed without choice: how your language works, what behaviors are "normal," what emotions are "acceptable," how power structures operate, what your culture believes about life and death.

The unconscious is not personal in the way the subconscious is. It's collective—shared across groups of people who share culture, language, and history.

#### The Conscious (Tiny Center of Awareness)

The conscious mind is the **tiny center of your awareness**—perhaps only 5-10% of your total perception. This is the part of you reading these words right now, the part that thinks "I am me" and makes deliberate choices.

The conscious mind is like a spotlight in a vast dark room. It can only illuminate a small area at a time, but it has the power to direct where it looks.

Most people spend their entire lives with this spotlight pointing outward, projecting onto other people and external situations. This is not awakening—this is distraction.

### Awakening: Going Within to Access Inner Vision

The awakening process is fundamentally about **redirecting your conscious spotlight from outward projection to inward exploration**.

Most people's conscious awareness is constantly focused on:
- What other people think of me
- What is happening in the external world
- What I need to achieve or acquire next
- How others should change to make me happy

This is the conscious mind projecting outward, trying to control and interpret the external environment. But true intelligence—true "reading between the lines"—requires going within.

When you turn your conscious awareness inward, you begin to access the **subconscious database** where 70% of your perception has been stored. You begin to see the patterns, the data, the wisdom that has been collecting in your peripheral vision your whole life.

This is what the third eye actually is: not a mystical organ that sees spirits and auras (though it can develop those capacities), but the **awakened ability to use inner vision to read your own subconscious data**.

The third eye reads between the lines of your own experience, accessing memories, patterns, and information that your conscious mind never noticed but your subconscious carefully archived.

### The Mirror Exercise: Accessing Subconscious Memory

One powerful practice for developing inner vision and accessing subconscious data is the mirror exercise:

Sit in front of a mirror in a dimly lit room. Gaze at your reflection without focusing sharply. Let your eyes soften, let your vision relax into peripheral mode.

As you watch, **shapes will begin to appear** in and around your reflection. You might see faces, forms, shadows, movements. These are not external entities attacking you—they are **subconscious memories and patterns surfacing into your conscious awareness**.

Do not fear what you see. If something appears that looks frightening (what some might call "demons"), do not run or close your eyes. Simply greet it: "Hello. I see you." Then refocus on your reflection.

These forms are aspects of yourself, stored memories, suppressed emotions, ancestral patterns held in your cells. By acknowledging them without fear, you begin to integrate them. They lose their power to operate hidden in your subconscious and become conscious material you can work with.

The mirror exercise uses your physical sight to access inner vision. Your eyes see your reflection, but your third eye reads the subconscious data stored in your cellular memory, and projects it as visible forms for your conscious mind to finally recognize.

### Cellular Memory and Physical Healing

Matias's transparency about his hemorrhoids is not just personal sharing—it's teaching. The body holds trauma from past experiences, past lives, ancestral memories. When you do deep spiritual work, especially in powerful locations like Egypt, that cellular memory surfaces to be healed.

Hemorrhoids specifically relate to the root chakra and cellular memories of survival, safety, grounding. For Matias, this physical manifestation is connected to processing 12,000-year-old memories from Egyptian incarnations—conflicts, violence, power struggles stored in the cells.

The healing happens through consciousness—acknowledging the pain, understanding its source, allowing the body to release the stored trauma through physical symptoms. This is why spiritual awakening often coincides with physical illness or discomfort. The body is releasing, processing, integrating.

Your own cellular memories may not be from ancient Egypt, but they are there. Every ancestor you carry, every difficult experience you've survived, every trauma inherited through your family line—all stored in cells, waiting for consciousness to read them.

Vision and the third eye help you see this data. Inner sight allows you to read between the lines of your physical symptoms and understand what your body is teaching you.

## Practice: Inner Vision and Tree of Life Integration

This meditation develops your capacity for inner sight, helping you access the subconscious database stored in your cellular memory.

### Steps

1. **Body Awareness and Massage**  
   Take a deep breath. Focus only on your breathing for several cycles.  
   
   Bring your hands to your crown and begin massaging from the crown toward the feet, touching each part of your body. As you touch each area, become aware of it. Remind your cells: "Everything I am doing is for your greatest good."

2. **Entering the Rainforest**  
   Close your eyes. Visualize yourself in the middle of a forest. Listen to the sound of birds and insects.  
   
   Walk deeper into the forest. Notice it becoming a rainforest. See tiny rays of light reaching the ground between the leaves of the greatest trees.

3. **The Tree of Life**  
   In the center of the rainforest, perceive the beautiful, huge Tree of Life. See how below its branches, everything becomes like night. Above, the sunlight coming through the leaves creates thousands of stars.

4. **Lying in the Roots**  
   Lie down on the roots of the tree. Look up toward the sky, toward the leaves.  
   
   Perceive the mud on your back. Feel yourself beginning to be swallowed slowly by this wetland. Feel the mud between your hands, surrounding your legs and arms, your feet, your shoulders.

5. **Becoming a Root**  
   Recognize: "I am becoming like a root of this tree. I am part of this Tree of Life."  
   
   Understand that within this tree, you can find all the information of all the history of everything you have ever been—different realities, families, lives. All of it lives within you.

6. **Accessing the Void of Mind**  
   Realize: "The only way I can perceive, can see all that information and history, is if I allow myself to fall deep into the void of my mind."

7. **Affirmation of Inner Sight**  
   Repeat silently: "I am the mind's emptiness. I am the mind's emptiness."  
   
   Feel that in this void, in this emptiness of thought, you can perceive being part of the Tree of Life and everything you can see within it.

8. **Declaring Your True Sight**  
   Affirm: "I desire to see what I really am. I am the physical body where all the visions of the cosmos incarnate. I am earth and water. I am mud. I am human."

9. **Covering Yourself with Mud**  
   With your hands, begin taking the mud from around you. Take a mud bath, covering each part of your body with this mineral-rich soil and seeds.  
   
   Repeat: "I am the mud that nourishes the Tree of Life."

10. **Return**  
    Gently bring your awareness back to your physical body in your current location. Feel your breath. Move your fingers and toes.  
    
    When ready, open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Peripheral Vision Practice

Several times today, soften your focus and become aware of your peripheral vision. Notice what you can see at the edges of your awareness without directly looking at it. Practice walking while maintaining peripheral awareness rather than tunnel-vision focus. Notice how much more data becomes available.

### Weekly Focus: Mirror Gazing

Set aside 10-15 minutes three times this week to practice mirror gazing. Sit in front of a mirror in dim light. Soften your gaze on your reflection. If shapes or forms appear, greet them calmly and continue observing. Journal about what you see and feel.

### Living the Teaching

When you catch yourself projecting awareness outward—worrying what others think, trying to control external situations, focusing on what you don't have—pause. Take a breath. Redirect your attention inward. Ask: "What am I feeling? What data is my subconscious trying to show me? What am I not seeing about myself?"

## Questions & Reflections

**Q: How can the subconscious hold 70% of perception if I'm not aware of it?**

That's exactly the point. Your brain is processing millions of data points every second—colors, sounds, smells, textures, movements, temperatures, air currents, electromagnetic fields. If all of that reached conscious awareness, you'd be paralyzed. The subconscious filters and stores it so consciousness can focus on immediate priorities. The data doesn't disappear—it waits in storage.

**Q: Is it dangerous to do the mirror exercise? What if I see something really frightening?**

The only danger is fear itself. Whatever you see in the mirror is part of you—a memory, a pattern, an emotion you've suppressed. It cannot harm you. The act of seeing it consciously is the beginning of healing it. If you run from it, it remains in shadow, operating your life unconsciously. If you greet it, it loses power.

**Q: Why would cellular memory from thousands of years ago surface as hemorrhoids?**

The body is literal. Hemorrhoids involve inflammation, bleeding, pain in the root area—the first chakra, connected to survival, safety, grounding. Egyptian memories might include violence, persecution, fear of death, instability. That emotional/spiritual trauma stored in cells manifests in the physical body part that corresponds to those themes. Healing the memory heals the body.

**Q: Can I develop inner sight even if I'm blind physically?**

Absolutely. Inner sight is not dependent on physical eyes. In fact, those without physical sight often develop stronger inner sight precisely because they're not distracted by external visual data. The third eye operates in consciousness, not in the optical system.

**Q: How do I know if something is subconscious wisdom versus just my imagination making things up?**

Test it. If subconscious data surfaces, it will correlate with reality in ways imagination alone cannot. It will reveal patterns you didn't consciously know, predict outcomes you couldn't logically foresee, or trigger deep emotional recognition. Imagination is useful, but wisdom has weight, coherence, and transformative power.

**Q: What's the difference between looking inward and being self-absorbed or narcissistic?**

Looking inward to access wisdom is about understanding the self to serve the whole. Narcissism is obsessing over the self to serve the ego. Inner vision seeks truth; narcissism seeks validation. One expands consciousness; the other contracts it.

**Q: If consciousness is only 5-10%, why do we put so much emphasis on conscious choice and free will?**

Because that small percentage has directive power. The subconscious is vast but reactive; consciousness is tiny but creative. Your conscious choices shape which subconscious data gets integrated and which remains dormant. Free will is real, but it operates in partnership with vastly larger unconscious systems.

**Q: How can I practice reading between the lines in everyday life?**

Start with people. When someone speaks, listen not just to their words but to their tone, body language, what they're not saying, the emotion beneath the message. Ask yourself: "What is being communicated beyond the literal content?" This develops the intelligence muscle.

## Closing Reflection

Today you have learned that true sight is not about looking harder at the external world but about developing the capacity to see within—to read the vast database of your own subconscious, to interpret the 70% of perception happening in your peripheral vision, to access the cellular memories archived in your body.

Intelligence is not cleverness or knowledge accumulation. It is the art of reading between the lines, perceiving the concepts and patterns hidden in the space between obvious data. This capacity awakens when you turn your conscious awareness inward instead of constantly projecting it outward.

The third eye is not a mystical organ that suddenly opens to reveal spirit realms. It is the natural result of training your consciousness to read its own subconscious material, to see the inner landscape with the same clarity most people reserve for the external world.

When you look in the mirror and shapes appear, you are not being haunted. You are finally seeing yourself—the memories, patterns, and aspects that have been operating in shadow. Greet them. They are you, seeking integration.

And when your body manifests physical symptoms during spiritual work, recognize this as cellular memory surfacing. Your body is reading the book of your soul, showing you pages you haven't consciously examined yet. This is not illness—this is healing in progress.

Go within. The vision you seek is not out there. It is in here, waiting in the mud, archived in the cells, stored in peripheral awareness. Read between the lines of your own experience, and you will find intelligence that no external teaching could ever provide.
