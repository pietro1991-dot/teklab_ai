## Introduction

Hi everyone , morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So as you have seen for sure today , I did n't sled much , I had it in some near. I have been , I do n't know if processing much , but let it myself feel. I am still in silence not talking with anybody. And honestly , I am not , I am not a mood of understanding what I am going through.

I am willing to feel. And as I spoke today with my eyes , it is better to let the rainbow flow. I guess it is interesting to share today about something I wrote in my conversation in the blog , which is about how subconscious makes us feel. Things that sometimes is not related to what we are living in our days.

And if I think about it , of course , I can relate it with certain things that just happened. But when I try to feel deeply why I can not say that they repeat once again , and that they are not related exactly with my left-day , it is related with a much deeper process that repeats every once in a while. And as my higher self-sad , it is like the sediments of a river that goes along my eyes and my eyes. I guess what got stuck in my mind about this is that all the things that we have in the subconscious , they remain there even if we do a healing process , even if we heal our history , they are still there.

It is not that something that you just transcluded and it disappeared. The subconscious is always there. And every time that you go back to the memories , the emotion came back , comes back , once again.

So it is not about to erase the past and what we felt is about how we can handle today , what it can be for. Precisely. The subconscious is the place where everything that we have felt where we have done goes to everything. And it is a place where the conscious on that , just used to put everything , all the information , all the things that are needed for our process today , it is put there in the subconscious and it remains forever.

So that is why to go to subconscious is not about healing something , it is about knowing yourself , it is about knowing what is we do and it is a part of you. One of the things that I realized after a long time , the living that we have to go to subconscious in order to heal , we are thinking that we have to heal the subconscious , but I just realized today that it is not like that we are not healing the subconscious. The conscious is like a kind of a library where all the data , all the information is there. Everything is there without any judgment , every book , every memory.

The process of healing starts when we realize that we have an unconscious behavior that we want to turn into conscious.

So , is our conscious that goes inside the subconscious to this library to look for the data and when we find it we start to become aware conscious.

So we can change our unconscious behavior. But actually you are not healing this subconscious , you are just understanding what is in the library. Eventually when we start to go to subconscious we start to discover that we all share kind of the same pattern , like loneliness , abandon , fears. It is like you fold of us share mostly the same even if it goes to other planets , other realms.

## Energy Work

And the problem that we have when we are trying to get into this subconscious is that there is no place for the conscious that is very difficult to put your mind on it and try to find a logic. You can only feel. Because we are mammals we usually tend to look for explanation for a logical explanation of why we are feeling like this , what is the root of all this. And trying to find a solution we try to help each other , saying this child pass.

And this you have to do this or that but actually not always has a meaning or a need to get out from this. And I mean myself , I am someone very positive in my life. Same those kind of things so that 's why I usually tend to. To push everyone to be happy to feel fine and I hide many things.

That as I was saying this , this dating which I find myself now is something that I I felt many times in my life is something that I. Usually tend to fall into like it 's not the first time. But today I was wondering why why it happened so many times. Why repeated self if I already put consciousness on that and understood why I was feeling this.

And today the answer was very simple. It is just because we are 70 % water.

So our life is a river. This is the cycle of water. And every moment that we feel like this is like this turns off the river. What it flows.

## Q&A

Maybe the reason why we feel like this. The answer to the question is because we are in a hurry to reach the ocean. And we did n't pay attention to the settlements and all the things that. That are grabbed by the river.

Today I was watching images of the great canyon in Arizona. I do n't know if you have seen the images but it 's something amazing to see because you can. Picture all the layers different colors of the canyon and. Every layer which color is basically all the sediments.

Of the river through. 500 regions of years.

So actually. There are like these layers of books in a library. And it 's a lot of information and. And eventually a river starts to pass through again and.

And a rose this land. Letting all the books appear and every time that the river runs. It takes part of the sediments. And the And The layers the books start to appear.

But in order to see all the layers of history all the books to the very depth. The river must go once again through the same spots. Turn in the same corners. Providing the sediments so a new layer can appear.

Usually we believe that in order to be an. And one you have to be in the top of the mountain. But actually. In order to know yourself.

What you have to do is to go deeper into the valley. This days I was feeling very ashamed of being like this so low and feeling that everything that I had explained was like nothing. It did n't work because I was feeling like this like exactly the opposite to our goal. And actually today I saw myself like what I was actually doing was like reading the books in the layers of the great canyon as I was going down.

What I was feeling these days is so many emotions that I can relate to things that are happening in my life right now but most of them are mixed with other lives and other memories from other different realities.

So it was like what I usually felt was like blaming on my house for making me a remember. And of course we usually blame into the ones we have aside around us of the things that are happening but actually they are just echoes from our subconscious. It 's not a blame on geography. It 's the responsibility of the choice that the river does to go through it.

My path is your path so that 's why I share it. Why I want my vibration στο , why press depreciation for today is Maria. Salman today is I am a dreamer of three nurse. Must Oh I am trying to use this.
