## Overview

Today is January 28th, the day of the Leo full moon that was mentioned at the beginning of this week—the most intense tension in the sky for all of 2021. It is a powerful day for catharsis, for releasing what no longer serves, for allowing the fire of Leo to burn away old patterns. But even as we release, we must understand what we are building upon, what holds us, what supports our very existence.

Today we arrive at Day 178, connecting with the knees—the joints that allow us to move forward on our path while remaining grounded. The knees hold the weight of the entire upper body and transfer it to the earth. They are the bridge between standing tall and walking forward. And our topic today is fundamentals—the foundations, the basement, the principles that everything else rests upon.

The word fundamentals comes from the Latin **"funds"** (basis, depth, things below) and **"mentum"** (element, structure, medium). Fundamentals represent the elements that you use from the bottom of things, from the basis of things, to hold what is built above. Just as a building needs a strong basement to support additional floors, your life—and humanity's collective life—needs fundamentals to support growth, evolution, and expansion.

This teaching will challenge a common spiritual misconception: the idea that to ascend, to evolve, to reach higher consciousness, you must break free from the past, cut ties with old patterns, transcend the "lower" aspects of existence. Today you will learn why this approach causes collapse rather than expansion. You will understand that your body is not yours alone—it is a building constructed by thousands of generations of ancestors, and you are simply decorating the current floor while building the next one.

## Core Teaching

### What Are Fundamentals?

The word **fundamentals** comes from the Latin word **funds**, which means the basis, the depth, the things that are below, underneath. **Mentum** means the element or the structure or the medium—the way in which you do something.

**Fundamental represents the elements that you use from the bottom of things, from the basis of things, to hold what is built above.** It's a structural word.

Fundamentals are really important to all constructions because they are the basis of all things. In architecture, the fundamental, the basement of a structure, are the first things that you have to design perfectly. Why? Because everything that is going to be above is related to what you build below.

**What is under is holding the structure.** The basement, the fundamentals, are the principles of all the things that you build. They are the structure, the basis of everything that you would do after you build the structure.

That's why we call the fundamentals the **principles of the universe**—the basic truths, the foundational laws that everything else follows.

### The Three Fundamentals of Life

When we speak about what is fundamental for our lives, we would say: **to eat, to sleep, to reproduce**. These are the main things that keep us alive. These are the three fundamental things that we all as animals need.

When you have these three things, when you take care of these three things and you don't have to fight for them, when you manage what you eat, what you produce, how you sleep—when you master these big fundamental principles of life—**then you can build whatever on top**.

You can create your own ways. You can build whatever you want for your own life. You can change anything. That means that every generation, in every life, in every circumstance, you will be able to decorate the house, change some structures, change situations, colors, whatever you want to show—and you will understand that you are able to do something different, but with the same fundamentals.

### Goals Are Born from Fundamentals

Something that is really fundamental to understand is this: **These three principles of life (eat, sleep, reproduce) are the ones that create also the purpose, the goal that I have to achieve in my life.**

For all of us sharing consciousness, for sure our goal in life is to survive, to eat. Our main goal, our main achievement in this life, would be to fulfill what we need to eat, where we have to eat.

Then our next goal is to be able to be quiet, to relax, so we can sleep, so we can live. That's the second one.

And of course, the third goal would be to find a way where I transcend myself, where I feel that I succeed in what I was meant to do—which is to produce, to reproduce.

**Basically, everything that we do as a goal in our life is precisely related to the fundamentals of that life.** And that's very important. I hope you pay attention to this link.

The importance of knowing about these fundamentals and how the goals are related to the origin helps us understand this: **We ourselves, our body, is the product of these fundamentals. We are here as a body because we have been constructed, built, through all this history of many people, of ancestors, who have been building this home that I call body.**

### You Are Not a New Building

In my biology, I have all the keys inside of me, in all my body, of these fundamentals of the body, of my life. **I myself, in this reality, I am fundamental in what I am right now because of a lot of people building this house.**

We are decorating this house now. But the fundamentals, the basement of this building that is my body, were created by people thousands of years ago. All the people after them were just rebuilding, redecorating the house. And now myself, I am just putting some colors through my life to this house that is my body.

**What is important to understand from this is that we are not just simple individuals living our own life.** We are the result of many individuals that were building this body.

**It's not like someone dies and that's it and there's a new one. No. It is the same body going through time, changing the shapes.**

It's like only one body that is constantly adding new things to its own structure. It's constantly adding. So **we are not separate individuals. We are the same individual once and again, once and again, practicing on our own self.**

This means that **everything that was programmed in the first humans, our ancestors, in our family, the main ones—they settled the idea of how my body is now.** So what I am doing towards the future, what I am doing to the future, is related to what happened in my past.

### The Danger of Breaking Your Foundation

When we are in the present, willing to build in the future, to do something in the future, to create, to manifest structures in the future for ourselves, for humanity, or whatever—it doesn't matter what we do—**if we are building up into another level of consciousness, what you build will be related to the basement of the first ones that started to build this house that we have, the body that we have, in the humanity.**

The example is basically like building a house. When you create a house and you're building in a new level of vibration, you build according to the same basement. You take the fundamentals that the old people, the first ones, created—the basement of the building—and you're just going up and creating a new level of consciousness following the same pattern.

**That's why it doesn't matter how much you go up, you will be following the same pattern as the rest.**

What is important to understand—and I was just saying this—is that **if we are willing to ascend, to go into another level of consciousness, we need to follow the patterns of the basement.**

And here's where the spiritual mistake happens. In our path of spirituality, what we used to do is say, "I want to enable a new level of consciousness, to go to another dimension. And in order to do so, I have to get rid of all the patterns of the past. I want to take out all this weight that is pulling me from the past, and I need to break or cut all these links with the patterns of the past."

**If I am going to break these structures from the past in order for me to build something in the future, then I will make the building collapse.**

Why? **Because basically what I am doing is trying to build a new room or a new floor in this building, but at the same time trying to break the ones below.** So I am destroying myself by doing that.

## Practice

### Honoring the Foundation

Today's practice is about recognizing the ancestors who built the basement of the building you call your body. You did not start from scratch. You inherited a structure.

**Step 1: Acknowledge Your Body's History**  
Sit or stand comfortably. Place one hand on your heart and one hand on your belly. Speak aloud or internally:  
"This body is not new. This body has been built over thousands of years. My ancestors laid the foundation. I am adding a floor, but I stand on what they built."

**Step 2: Feel the Knees**  
Bend your knees slightly, then straighten them. Repeat this several times. Feel how the knees hold the weight of your upper body and transfer it to the earth. The knees are the bridge—they honor what's above while staying rooted in what's below.

**Step 3: Recognize the Three Fundamentals**  
Ask yourself:  
- **Do I eat?** (Am I nourished?)  
- **Do I sleep?** (Am I rested?)  
- **Do I create?** (Am I expressing my life force?)

If any of these is missing or struggling, recognize that you cannot build higher consciousness without them. You must tend to the basement first.

**Step 4: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"Su"** three times, feeling it resonate in your knees and down through your ancestral line.  
Then speak: **"I Am the Path of My Ancestors."**  
You are not separate from them. You are them, continuing forward.

**Step 5: Release Without Destroying**  
If there are patterns from your past (or your ancestral past) that you need to release, ask: "Can I transform this rather than break it? Can I build with it rather than against it?"

The Leo full moon today supports cathartic release—but release what's excessive, not what's foundational. Burn the old decorations if you must, but do not set fire to the basement.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Tend to Your Three Fundamentals:**  
Today, check in with the basics. Do not try to expand spiritually if you have not eaten well, slept well, or expressed your creative life force.

1. **Eat something nourishing.** Not just calories—something that feeds you at a cellular level.  
2. **Rest properly.** Even 15 minutes of true rest counts.  
3. **Create something.** Write, draw, move, speak, build—express the life force that wants to reproduce itself through you.

**Honor Your Ancestors:**  
Light a candle or simply pause and say: "Thank you to those who built the basement of this body I live in. I do not take it for granted. I will not destroy what you built. I will honor it by building wisely upon it."

### Applying This Teaching

The spiritual idea of "cutting cords" or "releasing the past" or "transcending your karma" is often misunderstood. Yes, you can release patterns that no longer serve you. Yes, you can transform old programs. But you cannot erase the foundation without collapsing.

Your body contains the wisdom of every human who survived long enough to reproduce. You are here because your ancestors mastered the fundamentals—they ate, they slept, they reproduced, generation after generation, through ice ages and droughts and predators and plagues.

When you honor this, when you recognize that your body is a sacred inheritance, you stop trying to "fix" yourself by cutting away your humanity. You start building upward from a place of gratitude and strength.

Ask yourself: Am I trying to ascend by denying my body's needs? Am I trying to be "spiritual" by ignoring the fundamentals? If so, stop. Ground. Eat. Sleep. Create. Then, from that foundation, expand.

## Aquarius Mental Week Context

We are in the mental week of Aquarius, learning to think in patterns, systems, structures. The fundamentals teaching fits perfectly here—it asks you to think about your life as a structure, not just a random series of experiences.

The knees today (Su - I Am the Path of My Ancestors) represent the ability to move forward while staying connected to the lineage that came before you. Aquarius is future-oriented, innovative, revolutionary—but true revolution doesn't destroy the foundation. It builds new floors on a solid base.

This week is teaching you to use your mind to recognize: I am part of a system. My body is part of a pattern. I am not starting from zero. I am continuing a process that began long before me and will continue long after me.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What are the three fundamentals of life, and why do they matter?

The three fundamentals are: **to eat, to sleep, to reproduce (create)**. They matter because they are the basement of existence. If you don't eat, you die. If you don't sleep, you break down. If you don't create/reproduce in some form, your life force has no outlet. Every goal you have—spiritual, material, relational—rests on these fundamentals. You cannot build higher consciousness on a body that is starving, exhausted, or creatively stifled.

### Q: How is my body like a building with a basement?

Your body was not created fresh when you were born. It's the result of thousands of generations of genetic programming, survival strategies, adaptations. Your ancestors built the basement—the core structure, the fundamental programs (eat, sleep, reproduce, fight, flee, connect). You are just adding the current floor—your personality, your choices, your consciousness. But you cannot build this floor without the ones below it.

### Q: What does it mean that we are not separate individuals?

Your body is not "yours" in the sense of being separate from all other bodies. It is the continuation of one long, unbroken chain of bodies. Your great-great-great-grandmother's body became your grandmother's body became your mother's body became your body. The same cells, evolving. The same DNA, adapting. You are not a new creation—you are the same creation, continuing.

### Q: Why does trying to "break free" from the past cause collapse?

Because you are trying to build a new floor while demolishing the floors below. Spiritually, this looks like: rejecting your body's needs, denying your ancestry, cutting cords with your lineage, trying to "transcend" your humanity. But you cannot transcend what you rest upon. You can only expand upward from it. When you break the foundation, the whole structure falls.

### Q: How can I evolve without destroying my foundation?

By honoring it. By recognizing that your ancestors' survival strategies—eat, sleep, reproduce—are not "lower" than your spiritual goals. They are the platform for them. You evolve by building new floors on the solid base, not by levitating off the building. Transform patterns, yes. Release what's excessive, yes. But keep the fundamentals strong.

### Q: What does the Leo full moon have to do with fundamentals?

Leo is fire, catharsis, release, dramatic transformation. The full moon today supports letting go. But the teaching warns: burn what's unnecessary, not what's foundational. You can release old decorations, old stories, old identities—but do not burn down the basement of your body's basic needs and ancestral wisdom. That's not transformation; that's self-destruction.

### Q: How do I "tend to my fundamentals" in practical terms?

Every single day, check: Did I eat well? Did I rest? Did I create something? These are not optional. These are not "basic" in the sense of unimportant. They are basic in the sense of foundational. Everything you do spiritually, mentally, emotionally—all of it rests on these three. Tend to them first, always, and everything else becomes possible.
