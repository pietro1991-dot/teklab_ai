## Introduction

How are you everyone? How are you?

So , how is your full moon line? Of course , that for all of us in this connection , this day should be special. That 's why with this horrible conjunction of this guy , we are living this situation of conflict that made our first delay in a year and well , that 's the sign of this day. I hope that everyone is having a great day , despite of the moon or with the moon , and those who are not having a great day.

So , good for you too. For me , this day was really amazing and really aligned , really perfect and beautiful. But this is just because I was doing process the week before , as you have seen.

So , I was really good today.

So , it 's 11. 30 in the night hearing it. And tomorrow , we leave to visit the Ed Food Temple , the horse. At 6am , so I guess today I was only 5 hours or less.

So , I would try to be very.

So , let 's go to the topic for today and try to be straight to that. The topic for today is Fundamental , which is also foundations.

So , the foundations , the foundations of the things , comes from the Latin word , which is Funds. And Funds means the basis , the depth , the things that are below under that 's Funds. And meant means the element or the structure or the medium , the way in which you do something.

So , Fundamental represents the elements that you use from the bottom of the things , from the basis of the things to hold what they both.

So , it 's structural word.

So , the Fundamental are really important to all the constructions , because they are the basis of all the things. Basically , in architecture , the Fundamental , the basement of a structure are the first things that you have to design perfectly , because everything that is going to be above is related to what you build below.

So , what is under , what is under is holding the structure.

So , the basement , the Fundamental are the principles of all the things that you build.

So , what is the concept of these foundations? This is the structure , the Fundamental , the basis of everything that you would do after you build structure.

So , that 's why we call the Fundamental , the principles of the universe.

So , we talk about the principles of the universe as the Fundamental things that we have to do.

So , when we understand the basis of the things , the principles , the origin of the things we call them , the Fundamental , or the Fundamental principles of something. For example , when we speak about what is Fundamental for our lives , we would say to each , to sleep the main things that keeps us alive.

So , from those things , we can do all the rest of the things.

So , we have been all these days speaking about the three Fundamental things that we all as animals need , which is to eat , to sleep and to reproduce.

So , just take these three in image. When you have these three things , when you take care of these three things , and you do n't have to fight for them. When you just got to know how to handle what you eat , what you produce , how you sleep. When you can little this big Fundamentals principles of life , then you can build whatever on the top.

You can create your own ways , you can build whatever you want for your own life. You can just change anything.

So , that means that every generation in every life , in every circumstance , you will be able to decorate the house , changing some structure , situations , colours , whatever , to show , and you will understand that you are able to do something different , but with the same Fundamentals.

Something that is really Fundamental to understand of this process is that these three principles of life are the ones that create also the purpose , the goal that I have to achieve in my life. For example , for all of us , for sure , for all of us , where we are sharing a suspicious is that our goal in life is to try to survive to eat.

So , our main goal in our main achievement in this life would be to fulfill where we need to eat , where we have to eat. Then , to our next goal is to be able to be quiet , to relax so we can sleep , so we can live , that 's the other one , and of course the third one would be to find a goal where I transcend myself , where I feel that I succeed in what I was meant to do , which is produce , reproduce.

So , basically everything that we do as a goal in our life is precisely related with the Fundamental of that life. And that 's very important so I hope you pay attention to this link that I 'm doing.

So the importance to know about these fundamentals and how the goals are related to the origin helps us to help us by understanding that that we , ourselves , our body , is the product of this fundamentals we are here as a body , because we have been constructed built through all this history of a lot of people of Mathrm since the people. Then have been building this home that I call body.

So in my biology I have all the keys inside of me in all my body of this fundamentals of the body of my life.

So I myself in this reality I am fundamental in what I am right now because of a lot of people building this house , we are decorating this house. But the fundamentals were made a long time ago the basement of this building that is my body , we are created by people thousands of years ago and all the people they were just , they were just , I 'm decorating , rebuilding the house and now myself , I am just putting some colors through my life to this house that is my body. What is important to understand from this is that we are not just simple individuals living our own life. There are the result of many individuals that were building this body.

So it 's not like someone dies and that 's it and there 's a new one. No , is the same body going through time changing the shapes. It 's like a , it 's like only one body that is constantly adding new things to its own structure.

Okay , it 's constantly adding.

So we are not separate individuals. We are the same individual once and again , once and again , practicing on our own self.

So this means that everything that was programmed in the first humans of our ancestors , but our family , the main ones , they settled the idea of how is my body now.

So what I am doing towards the future , what I am doing to the future is related to what happened in my past.

Sorry , but there 's something that a computer that is showing up something that I do n't know if it 's going to , I do n't know what 's happening , but I say no , no , no , and it comes popping up once and again. What we have to understand today is that when we are in the present willing to build in the future to do something in the future , to create , to manifest structures in the future for ourselves , for the humanity or whatever. It does n't matter what we do , if we are building up into another level of consciousness , what you build will be related to the basement of the first ones that started to build this house that we have in the body that we have in the humanity. And the example is basically like building a house.

When you just create a house and you 're building in a new level of vibration , what you are just to build according to the same basement.

So you take the fundamentals of the all people , the first ones create the basement of the building and you 're just going up and creating a new level of consciousness , following the same pattern.

So that 's why it does n't matter how much you go up , you will be following the same pattern as the rest.

So what is important of this to understand when it was just saying that if we are willing to ascend to go into another level of consciousness , we need to follow the patterns of the basement. Is that in our path of spirituality where we used to do is to say , I want to enable level of consciousness to another dimension. And in order to do so I have to get rid of all the patterns of the past. I want to take out all this weight that is pulling me from the past and I need to break or to cut all these links with the patterns of the past.

So if I am going to break this structures from the past in order for me to build something in the future , then we 'll make the building collapse , because. Because basically what I am doing is to try to build a new room or a new floor in this building , but at the same time trying to break the ones below.

So basically I am destroying myself by doing that.

So this is why in order to really build up in another conscious , what we have to do is to go back to see the basement if they are really strong enough to go up.

So this example for example , if you are architects or or someone knows about building structure , I do n't know much , but just a tiny example. If you are willing to go up and to make your building grow as much as possible.

So first the first thing you have to do is to do the basement. If the structure in the basement is strong enough to hold the growing up.

So when you understand this , you can start to know how much can you grow up , but there will be this moment in which if you. If you try to go up and hire higher , what you will have to do is to make wider the bottom the basement. Because to make to have a structure there is straight you will need like I do n't know the word English , but. Contrafuerte how do you say this in English?

Well , like these arches that you have in the church that that you have it like this , this kind of columns like are like these or arches that. And that 's why there are the basement of the building so you can hold the structure and go up and up or both okay , so this.

So we are able to go higher.

So we need this supports from the ground. Yes , so in the concept. Is what we what we would say we need to know better our path as much we know our past as much wider is our conception of our history.

So we have better structures on the sides to hold the building to go up. Autres. Thank you. Autres is how you say it.

So this autres. Thank you. Is the structure that you need to hold the structure and this for us is talking about the past as much you know the past the best you will build the future.

So now picture this architectural example. Take that this basement. This basement is your body your biological body.

So usually what people used to do is to create this basement and then life after life we start to put bricks and more bricks and more bricks and going up and up.

Okay , so up or go I create more more floors so I can see wider around I can see better the horizon.

So I can take different views of my own reality. But what happened what we usually do is to to be willing to build up and up and up to see more and more and more but we do n't pay attention to the basement we do n't go to the past we do n't go to see what is our history. Or we just want to run away from our history. Bill and future.

So what happened that this building that we are creating is so , so high that suddenly becomes a tower but this tower now autres just collapse. And that 's what we used to call the crisis. The crisis is the moment when this just is that the structure breaks down and you and you do n't know how to handle your things this is like the tarot when they explain the the tower which the breaks and it 's like a like a crisis. A change of your whole life so this usually happens because we are just following the patterns of our own biological body but trying to escape from it going up and up.

So now how can I do for this tower to not collapse?

So I have to build this autres. And this autres for one side we will call them the soul and the soul has its own past history. This soul is the energy that has lived through many lives and many experiences beyond my own biological expression.

Okay , it was in different realms and different species and everywhere in the existence.

So I have to take that information from my soul in order to hold the building and the other autres will be the spirit which is the history of the cosmos of the galaxies , the stars , the I am , the history of all the concepts of the universe. The dimensions , etc.

So when I have this two I can hold the building.

So now I have the basis of the soul , the body and the spirit , three of them can go in up to the divine.

So now the physical biological body has the need which is to eat to tourism itself. The fundamentals of the soul needs to sleep. It needs to dream to rest. And the base , the fundamentals of the spirit is to reproduce to manifest something.

But as you see , this three has a fundamental that creates the fundamental needs of every living being. The spirit , the soul and the body , each one of them has a need that together creates the main need of every living being in existence. Sleep eat and reproduce.

So this explains we have a history of fundamentals created by these three beings that we all have within.

## Q&A

So if we follow the three coherence , we will be able to build our path to the future to manifest , to be , to create , to be divine. But if we follow only the life , only the fundamentals of the soul or the body or the spirit , the tower will collapse. This is why in order to reach the divine , what we have to do is to recognize the past the fundamentals of our systems , the past of our structure in order to be able to reach that heaven. The question for today would be , what are the basis of my future , what are the fundamentals of my future?

And based of what I am willing to create.

So this conjunction for today is this terrible conjunction is something really good because it helps us to make that leap into think , how can we use the filaments of our past to structure a better future.

So this is why the days like this one are the ones that represents the tower because they show us if we were building a tower or a big structure. One of the keys of today is that in order to reach the light , we should not try to go straight to the light , going through their missions to ascend. When we have to do this to expand ourselves , when we expand ourselves , we build a better structure to hold the light. And how can I expand myself?

Well , expanding your mind , your soul and your body , which means open yourself to reach new answers to make more questions , to look for new books , new cultures , new philosophies. To go into another cultures , to open yourself to other people , not to stay only with what you perceive , feel or believe. Looking to the past , study last , open your mind. Expand is not to stay in the same place as always.

To expand to open my possibilities to make my terrain more wider.

## Energy Work

Remember that the way in which you opened wider your space in order to build yourself is when you first start to look in your family to acknowledge your past from where you come from. And then , do n't to open the memory of your soul , do n't just mediate and try to remember your past lives. You go and reach the cultures learn about the history and try to find out which periods of time , which countries you feel more attached to , to awaken the memories of your soul to understand your roots in this planet.

So by reading , by learning your way , the potential of the spirit , by doing something artistic , making your initial up.

Remember , the fundamentals of our history , the biological from the body , the soul and the one from the spirit , the three of them , helps us to create a more wider , pendant or understanding of our fundamentals to see how we can build in the future. It 's the only way.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is the statement for today is I am the S of the Path of Light. The code for today is Silica. In all the terrestrial cortex , this end is the 28 %.

This means the second most important one. It is the generator base of all volcanic rocks , crystals , quartz and minerals like granite , mica , tourmaline , aluminium and several others. As a result of being the system of the vegetable world , it 's at the same time one of the most important nutrients necessary for vegetable growth.

Something that makes its consumers incorporate the chemical as essential , mainly improving the neural system and self repairing and creation of the dermal and muscular system , certain , teeth and cartilage.

So just to remind you that Silica is really good on creating tissues , structures.

So this is why it 's really good to awaken the memory to create networks.

So if you eat in your diet , you put much more step that would help you to have better memory eventually and also to be connected to the memory of the planet.

So let 's go to the alignment. See it comfortable , focus and everything. And softly I start to make a soft massage to old body , recognize in each part of it. Take a deep breath and recognize your body and bolt your whole spirit.

And with my imagination , I start to design this temple. And I start to design this temple. I start to imagine it. Really , no expertise.

Friends soon. If it is the cave , an ancient temple. It is a very short , stone circle , the palace. No judging allow yourself to perceive the temple.

## Q&A

I pay attention to see if this temple has productivity , has plans , trees or is just a desert. If it is old or closed , I observe if there is brown or just an ancient. I start to pay attention to the main questions of this building. What it was built for?

Why? I try to picture myself. Where do I find myself in this temple? I pay attention to the basement , the fondiments of this temple in the legs of the knees.

I try to feel to perceive the intention of the objects of this temple , the builders , the workers. I have seen the buildings , the temples , where I live now , and from where I observe them from the top. Then with my sound , acknowledging that I am the result of building from the past , trying to reach the future. I am the result of building from the past.

I recognize that this construction is made towards the light. I am the essence of the path of light. I am the essence of the path of light. I take a deep breath and a well expanding the fundamentals , the basis of the abiding your soul and your spirit.

I am the essence of light. I am the essence of light. I am the essence of light. Take a deep breath and come back here and now as you start to spread this conscious through all your body , the essence and stretching.

Remember , this is the power of the future , the expansion of our past. I am the essence of light.
