# Day 83 - Silence and Sound

## Overview

Today explores polarity between silence and sound, continuing Libra's Physical Week. We've spoken about whole and void, everything and nothing. These aren't opposites—they're complementary. Nothing gives birth to everything, everything returns to nothing, constant cycle never ending.

If universe is vibration (sound), vibration must come from silence. How can sound that vibrates come from silence that doesn't exist? The answer dissolves our simple concept of beginning and end.

Nothing and everything don't have origin/end relationship. They're like die and rebirth—constant. Nothing gives birth to everything, then everything dies and rebirths in nothing. Nothing, everything, nothing, everything, constantly. Universe never really began. Universe is constant all the time.

Vibration is everything—different vibrations create all existence. Sound is attribute of vibration (not vibration itself). Silence is all vibration without any movement—everything unexpressed. Sound is vibration expressing itself through frequency. Sound manifests; silence assimilates.

## Core Teaching

### Vibration, Frequency, and Sound

Everything that exists is vibration. Vibrations create existence we feel and perceive. Sound is attribute of vibration—the way you perceive vibration, not vibration itself.

Imagine thunderstorm lightning: positive and negative vibration join together, creating light and sound. Sound is what happens when vibrations interact, not the vibration.

Vibration starts moving by positive and negative in different frequencies. Frequency is time expression of vibration. Like storm in sea: sea is vibration, different waves of storm are frequencies. Frequencies = time expression of vibration generating many vibration options.

According to their resonance, they will sound; according to resonance, they attach to each other, creating shapes and realities we see now. This is how atoms create forms by joining through vibration, through vibration charges.

### Silence Is Not Opposite of Sound

Imagine flat lake with no movement. You throw rock; rock moves water. Movement creates frequencies (waves). Frequency distorts lake reality, creating patterns you can see. This is how vibration creates reality patterns.

All that—wave patterns, frequencies, movement—is perceivable. But when water goes back to balance (no movement), what happened to vibration? Did it disappear?

No. Water is vibration. Vibration doesn't disappear. Only thing that disappears is our ability to interpret vibration.

The only thing making us perceive vibration existence was frequency. Frequency is time. Without time, we cannot perceive reality. We don't exist. No pattern exists. We are nothing.

Without movement of time (ripple of time), vibration is static. Static means status: stable in one place, same shape.

Silence is not opposite to sound. Silence is all sounds, all vibration without any movement. Everything is there (water). But there's no time, no frequencies. No frequency, no time = no way to perceive distance, sound, reality. Nothing.

### Sound: Attribute of Vibration Manifesting

Sound is attribute of vibration manifesting itself in different frequency levels. Silence is all vibration without expressing any attribute.

When you make sound, when you express vibration, you're setting an intention. You push your vibration toward a direction. This creates limit. Creates pattern. You're stuck in pattern you expressed.

While you talk, while you create movement, you create patterns around that limit your expression. You're able to create, but on other hand, silence is ability to perceive all directions, perceive whole lake. Everything. Not just one goal, but all of them.

This is why when we feel too many things inside, we say "too many noise within me." When trying to find answers within, we meditate in silence. Go meditate within silence, find vacuum/void within to find answers.

### The Void Is Fullness Unexpressed

How is it possible void/silence would have all answers? How can you feel plenty in void?

Because void is biggest everything you could possibly imagine, but that doesn't express its attributes yet. Void and silence is everything that hasn't been expressed in attributes yet.

This is why listening is important. Not only for respect, but for meditation. When you're silent and practice listening to others, what you accomplish is listening to yourself, being able to listen to truth and answers you have within. Usually you don't hear because you talk too much. They're silenced by ego.

### Sound Manifests, Silence Assimilates

Sound, all sounds we do, all chanting, everything is expression, experimentation, manifestation of patterns creating and transforming our realities.

Silence is tool allowing us to assimilate that information, integrate that experience, bring awareness to where we've created.

Reality is like a song. Silence in song is even more important than sound itself. Spaces and silences between notes, between each part, pulses between moments of tension and moments of resolution—these make song important because they're moments you assimilate sound.

During whole song, brain tries understanding when tension comes, how resolution comes. Even if not thinking precisely about it, brain does it—constantly trying to match and understand song pattern.

In silence at end of song, brain relaxes and integrates everything. This is how silence becomes inner catalyst of all information.

Remember: everything you call sound in outside is not something coming to you by sound. It's interpretation of your brain through vibration of your inner ear.

Sound is tool to transform, create, manifest. Silence is tool to assimilate, integrate, be aware.

## Practice: Throat Activation Through Sound

**Preparation:**
- Sit comfortably, legs straight
- Stretch, massage body
- Let weight fall, relax, focus on breathing

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation (left foot → head → right foot)

**Throat Chakra Work:**

19. With two fingers each hand (heart finger and pointing finger)
20. Raise, massage all your throat and neck from front
21. Begin by jaw, going down
22. Take close by sides of throat
23. Soft movements up and down, down and up
24. As you massage, perceive light and consciousness of I Am starting to go within body

**Integration Through Sound:**

25. I Am comes down through crown, third eye, anchoring in throat
26. Breathe deeply in zero
27. As massaging, pronounce sound coming toward mouth
28. Raise, massage throat, come down, up
29. Bring sound toward mouth while massaging
30. As pronouncing sound, allow yourself perceive, feel vocal cords vibrating

**Statement and Spreading:**

31. State: "I am coherent evolution" (repeat)
32. Perceive light and consciousness starting to go down through each joint of body
33. Go with it across, massage each part of body
34. Stretch body gently, raise head
35. Return here now, open eyes

**Closing:** Remember importance of listening and silence. Drink water, rest, assimilate information.

## Key Insights

1. Silence and sound are complementary, not opposite—silence contains all unexpressed
2. Vibration is constant; frequency is time expression of vibration
3. Sound is attribute of vibration when expressed, not vibration itself
4. Without time/frequency, we cannot perceive reality—we are nothing
5. Silence is all vibrations without movement—everything unexpressed
6. Sound sets intention, creates patterns, limits expression to specific direction
7. Void/silence contains all possibilities before manifestation into attributes
8. Listening to others is practicing listening to yourself
9. Too much talking silences inner truth by ego noise
10. Sound manifests and creates; silence assimilates and integrates
11. Silence in music is more important than notes—it's when you assimilate
12. Brain constantly tries matching patterns during sound, integrates during silence
13. Sound you hear is brain's interpretation of inner ear vibration
14. Silence is inner catalyst of all information
15. Reality is like song—spaces between notes create meaning

## Integration

**Daily:** Practice silence after conversations. Notice how your brain assimilates what was said in quiet moments, not during speaking.

**Weekly:** Throat chakra massage with sound practice. Feel vocal cords vibrating. Alternate making sound (manifesting) and silence (assimilating).

**Monthly:** Spend one day speaking minimally. Notice how much you hear when you're not creating sound patterns. Listen to yourself.

**Ongoing:** Recognize silence is not emptiness—it's fullness unexpressed. Before manifesting (creating sound), rest in silence where all possibilities exist.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If silence is all vibration, how is it different from sound?**
A: Silence is vibration without frequency/time/movement. Sound is vibration expressing through frequency. Like still lake (silence) vs. waves in lake (sound). Water exists in both, but movement makes difference.

**Q: Why is silence more important than sound in music?**
A: Silence is when brain assimilates patterns. During sound, brain tries matching, predicting. In silence (between notes, at end), brain relaxes and integrates what it heard. Meaning happens in pauses.

**Q: How can void be fullness?**
A: Void contains all possibilities unexpressed. Like still lake contains all potential wave patterns. Silence holds all sounds before they manifest. Fullness waiting to express attributes.

**Q: Why do we need sound if silence has everything?**
A: Sound manifests specific directions from infinite silence possibilities. You need expression to create, experience, learn. Then return to silence to assimilate and integrate learning.

**Q: How does listening to others help listen to self?**
A: When you're silent (not preparing response), you practice being present without ego noise. This same skill lets you hear your inner truth usually drowned out by mental chatter.

**Q: What's difference between vibration and frequency?**
A: Vibration is constant presence (like lake). Frequency is time expression of vibration (like waves). Frequency makes vibration perceivable through creating patterns in time.

**Q: Why does sound create patterns that limit?**
A: When you express vibration in specific direction, you manifest one possibility from infinite silence. This creates beautiful pattern but excludes other directions. Like choosing path—lovely walk, but can't walk all paths simultaneously.

**Q: Is meditation about achieving silence?**
A: Not achieving external silence, but entering internal silence where all vibrations exist unexpressed. This is void/fullness where you access everything before it becomes specific patterns.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching reveals sound and silence as manifestation and integration—two halves of complete cycle. Without sound, silence remains unexpressed potential. Without silence, sound has no space to be born or understood.

You exist in constant rhythm between these poles. You speak (manifest patterns), then pause (assimilate meaning). You create vibrations (express intentions), then return to stillness (integrate experiences). Your throat chakra is gateway between unexpressed fullness and manifested creation.

Remember: too many noise within means you're manifesting without assimilating. When you can't find answers, you're searching in sound instead of silence. The void you fear is actually fullness—all vibrations waiting patiently without frequency, holding every possibility you'll ever need.

Listen more than you speak. Not as restriction, but as doorway to inner catalyst where silence assimilates all information, integrates all experience, reveals all truth. That's coherent evolution.
