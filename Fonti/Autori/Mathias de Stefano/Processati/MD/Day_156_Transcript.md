## Overview

On January 6th, we explore the Law of Polarity—the sixth Hermetic principle. Matias teaches that **polarity is the axis that allows the continuity of life.** Without polarity, there is no movement. Without movement, there is no transformation. Without transformation, there is no evolution.

Polarity is not the same as duality. **Polarity is finding your axis.** Duality is losing your axis and depending on external forces. When you understand polarity, you understand that life moves between two poles—positive and negative, masculine and feminine, expansion and contraction—and **you are the axis between them.**

This teaching becomes deeply personal when Matias explains relationships: when two people vibrate at different levels, one must lower their vibration to match the other, or the connection breaks. **True love is resonance—vibrating at the same frequency.** When there's no resonance, there's dependency, and that's duality, not polarity.

## Core Teaching

### Everything Exists Because of Polarity

The sixth Hermetic law is the Law of Polarity.

**Everything that exists does so because of polarity.** Without polarity, there would be no movement. Without movement, there would be no life.

Polarity is what allows the universe to keep going. It's the force that creates continuity, transformation, evolution.

### What Is Polarity?

Polarity comes from the word **"polo,"** which means **axis.**

**Polarity means the quality of being in the axis.** It's the harmonious balance of a movement that creates consequence.

The axis is the center point between two opposing forces. **Without the axis, the two forces cannot connect. Without connection, there's no flow.**

### Polarity vs. Duality

This is critical to understand: **polarity is not the same as duality.**

**Polarity = finding your axis.** You are centered. You are balanced. The two forces (positive and negative) flow through you, and you remain stable.

**Duality = losing your axis.** You are split. You swing from one extreme to the other, like a pendulum without a center. You depend on external forces to define you.

**In polarity, you are whole.** In duality, you are broken.

### The Tetrahedron: The Geometry of Polarity

Matias uses the symbol of two interlocking triangles to explain polarity.

One triangle points up (positive). One triangle points down (negative). Together, they form a **tetrahedron**—a 3D shape that represents the axis of polarity.

This is the same as the Star of David, the Merkaba, the geometry of creation.

**One force goes up. The other goes down.** One expands. The other contracts. And in the center, there is the axis—the point of balance.

This is you. **You are the axis.**

### Masculine and Feminine: Not Gender, But Energy

Polarity is often explained through masculine and feminine energy.

**Masculine energy = positive, outward, giving.** It projects energy outward.

**Feminine energy = negative, inward, receiving.** It pulls energy inward.

This has nothing to do with gender. **Every human has both energies.** Every human is both masculine and feminine.

The key is balance. If you only give (masculine), you burn out. If you only receive (feminine), you stagnate.

**You need both.** You are the axis between them.

### The Kundalini: Polarity in the Body

In the human body, polarity is the **Kundalini.**

The Kundalini is the energy that moves between two poles: one at the base of the spine (root, negative) and one at the crown of the head (positive).

**One current goes down. One current goes up.** They spiral around the spine, creating a vortex.

This vortex is what creates the **chakras**—the energy centers in the body.

**Without polarity, there would be no chakras.** Without chakras, there would be no energy flow. Without energy flow, there would be no life.

**The Kundalini is polarity.** It's the axis of your being.

### Polarity in Relationships: Resonance vs. Dependency

Matias gives a powerful teaching about relationships:

Imagine two people. **Person A vibrates high** (they are on a spiritual path, working on themselves, expanding). **Person B vibrates low** (they are stuck in fear, survival, limitation).

Person A wants to connect with Person B. So, Person A **lowers their vibration** to match Person B. Now they can connect. But Person A has sacrificed their high vibration.

This is not healthy. **This is duality, not polarity.**

Now, imagine Person C comes along. Person C vibrates at the same high level as Person A used to. There's **resonance**—they match. The connection is effortless. The love is strong.

Person A realizes: "I was vibrating high, and I lowered myself to match Person B. But I don't know how to handle low vibrations anymore. This feels broken."

**What's broken?** The flow. The axis.

**When you lose your axis to match someone else, you enter duality.** You become dependent on the other person to define your vibration.

**In polarity, you hold your axis.** You vibrate at your natural frequency, and you attract those who resonate with you.

### Duality: The Broken Axis

Duality is when you **divide yourself in two.**

With one person, you act one way. With another person, you act another way.

**You have no axis.** You swing back and forth, depending on who you're with.

This is what most of culture teaches us: be different with different people. Adapt. Adjust. Change yourself to fit in.

**But this is not polarity. This is duality.**

A person in polarity **is always the same**, no matter who they're with. They hold their axis. They are authentic, consistent, whole.

### The Lower Astral: The Trap of Low Vibration

The teaching for today is connected to the **Lower Astral**—the densest part of the subconscious.

The Lower Astral is the energetic level where the most pressure is generated. It's the gravitational web of the astral plane, the heaviest, slowest vibration.

**We call this "hell."** But it's not a place of punishment. It's simply the densest pool of energy.

**You are only trapped there if your vibration matches it.** If you vibrate low (fear, anger, survival), you sink into the Lower Astral. If you vibrate high, you rise above it.

**This is polarity.** High and low are not good and bad. They are simply different vibrations. You are trapped only when you lose your axis and can't move between them.

### Why Does Polarity Have a Bad Reputation?

Matias asks: **Why do people think polarity is bad?**

Because they confuse polarity with duality.

**Polarity is what allows the Earth to move.** Without the Earth's rotation, there's no transformation, no evolution, no life.

**Polarity is movement.** Duality is being stuck in the movement, swinging back and forth without a center.

**Polarity is the axis.** Duality is the loss of the axis.

### Finding Your Axis Again

How do you find your axis when you've lost it in duality?

**Tune yourself.** Synchronize yourself to something that makes you feel good, that makes you feel aligned.

This could be therapy, meditation, nature, creativity, love, faith—anything that helps you reconnect to your center.

But here's the key: **you have to change your behavior.** If you go to therapy and then do the same things you did before, nothing changes.

**It's like going to the doctor for a diet, and then buying ice cream with Nutella on the way home.**

You have to **synchronize yourself to a higher vibration** and then **stay in that vibration.**

**Hold your axis.**

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit comfortably with your spine straight.
2. Place your hand on your sacral chakra (below your navel).
3. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Feel the warmth in your sacral chakra. This is the center of your polarity.

2. Imagine a current of energy at the base of your spine (root) and another at the crown of your head.

3. Visualize these two currents spiraling around your spine, creating a vortex.

4. This is your Kundalini. This is your polarity.

5. Now, ask yourself: "Where have I lost my axis? Where have I entered duality?"

6. Visualize yourself with a specific person or situation. Notice: are you changing yourself to match them? Are you lowering your vibration?

7. See yourself holding your axis. See yourself vibrating at your natural frequency.

8. Imagine the person or situation adjusting to match you—or leaving. Either way, you remain centered.

9. Repeat: **"I Am the Stairs of Evolution."**

10. **"I Am the Stairs of Evolution."**

11. **"I Am the Stairs of Evolution."**

12. Feel yourself as the axis. You move through different vibrations, but you remain centered.

13. You are not split. You are not swinging. **You are whole.**

14. Take a deep breath. Bring your awareness back to your sacral chakra.

15. Feel the polarity within you—the masculine and feminine, the positive and negative, the up and down.

16. You are the axis that holds them together.

### Closing

1. Open your eyes slowly.
2. Remove your hand from your sacral chakra.
3. Return to the present moment, holding your axis.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Observe where you lose your axis. With whom do you change yourself? In what situations do you act differently than your true self? Notice the duality. Then, practice holding your axis: be the same person in all situations. Vibrate at your natural frequency, and see what happens.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel yourself changing to match someone else's energy, pause and ask: "Am I lowering my vibration? Am I losing my axis?" Remember, true connection is resonance, not adaptation. Hold your center. Be authentic. Let those who resonate with you come closer, and let those who don't find their own path. You are the axis. Stay whole.

## Q&A

### Q: What is the difference between polarity and duality?

Polarity is having an axis—a center point between two opposing forces. You are balanced, whole, and the forces flow through you without pulling you off center. Duality is losing that axis—being split between two extremes, swinging back and forth, depending on external forces. Polarity is integration. Duality is fragmentation.

### Q: Why is polarity necessary for life?

Without polarity, there's no movement. The Earth rotates because of polarity (positive and negative poles). Your heart beats because of polarity (expansion and contraction). Your breath flows because of polarity (inhale and exhale). Movement creates transformation. Transformation creates evolution. Without polarity, everything would be static—and static means death.

### Q: What is the Kundalini, and how does it relate to polarity?

The Kundalini is the energy in your body that moves between two poles: the root (negative, base of spine) and the crown (positive, top of head). Two currents spiral around your spine in opposite directions, creating a vortex. This vortex forms the chakras. The Kundalini IS polarity—it's the axis of your energetic body.

### Q: How do relationships show polarity vs. duality?

In polarity, two people hold their own axes and vibrate at their natural frequencies. If they resonate (match frequencies), they connect effortlessly. In duality, one person lowers or raises their vibration to match the other, losing their axis. This creates dependency, not true connection. Resonance is healthy polarity. Dependency is duality.

### Q: What does it mean to "hold your axis"?

It means being the same person in all situations—authentic, consistent, whole. You don't change yourself to match others. You vibrate at your natural frequency. Those who resonate with you will stay; those who don't will leave. Either way, you remain centered. This is integrity. This is polarity.

### Q: What is the Lower Astral?

The Lower Astral is the densest, heaviest vibration in the subconscious—the gravitational center of the astral plane. We call it "hell," but it's not punishment; it's simply low vibration (fear, anger, survival). You're only trapped there if your vibration matches it. If you vibrate high, you rise above it. It's not a place; it's a frequency.

### Q: How do I find my axis again if I've lost it?

Tune yourself to something that makes you feel aligned—meditation, nature, creativity, therapy, love. Then, **change your behavior.** Don't just do the inner work and then go back to the same patterns. Synchronize to a higher vibration and stay there. Hold your center. This is how you reclaim your axis.

### Q: Why do people think polarity is bad?

Because they confuse it with duality. They think polarity means being split, swinging between extremes, conflict. But that's duality. Polarity is the axis that STOPS the swinging. Polarity is balance, integration, wholeness. It's the force that allows life to continue. Without it, we'd have no movement, no evolution.
