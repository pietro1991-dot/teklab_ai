## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good evening , good afternoon , first. How are you? We 're good.

So let 's begin with today 's topic which is polarity.

Today I think that is really much easier. Very easy.

So everyone who has seen the previous videos , you will know what it came from this image.

So if you do n't , just looking to the other videos to see this explanation. What? Because I will try not to explain everything again.

## Q&A

So remember , from one idea of the mind , emerges the next. A question and an answer. In this mind , in the origin of this idea , emerges two things. Question one answer.

And the interaction between this question and an answer is what we call correspondence.

So here we have the mind. The mind from the internal makes a question.

So this question goes outside to look for an answer.

So remember , this mind makes a question. The question has an answer , but this answer has creates a new doubt.

So a new question. And this question has another answer. And so on starts to repeat constantly and they communicate constantly in question answer question answer. That 's where we call correspondence.

So this here is what creates this wave of question answer , question answer , question answer. And we can see that as a vibration.

Okay , let 's take a look at this.

So here we have the vibration.

So this waves , this curves here in the wave are the ones that we call frequency. And this frequency is what we will call rhythm. We have here that this cause , the cause of this positive generates an effect in this negative. And the cause of this negative generates an effect in this positive.

And so on it repeats in cause and effect , cause and effect , cause and effect. See , why? Due to what do we have correspondence , rhythm , vibration and cause and effect , is because of polarity. Polarity.

So nothing that you have here would exist without the concept of polarity.

So what it polarity? Polarity comes from the word polo that use axis. This is what polarity means. Polarity means the quality of being in the axis.

Polarity will be this harmonious axis of a movement that we call consequence , remember from yesterday.

So the consequence , what is the consequence? Is an attribute of being harmonious in your own axis? And what is an axis? Is a polarity.

So the only way in which you can be in your own axis. And to be coherent is only that 's polarity. Polarity is the one that allows the continuity of things.

So why polarity has such a bad press?

So this polarity is the things to this polarity that the earth moves. If the earth does n't move , there is no transformation. With no transformation , there is no evolution , there is no life. This implies that everything exists because of polarity.

A human have also polarity.

So that 's the secret of polarity in humans we call it Kundalini. We look into this like a snake. That 's why we call it Kundalini. But what it really is is a wave of polarity.

So one of the currents go down and the other one goes and then it wants to go up.

So one of these forces goes down and the other one goes up , pushing the energy up.

So that creates like a vortex in the center that we call chara. There would be no chara without polarity. See , no chara. No human.

No alma. And if there is no chara , there is no soul , there is no human.

So we have a positive over our heads and a negative below our head. And that 's what creates the movement of the energy.

So then you can call it whatever you like because in every culture , every region , you have a different way to call this. Let 's go to an organic polarity born from this system.

So everyone knows this symbol.

Okay. Triangle up , triangle down. Positive.

Okay. This is called tetra-heatron. Like this.

Now you add it. See?

So this is the tetra-heatron.

Okay.

Now you can see the 3D shape of this.

Okay. Kind of there.

So we have this other one down there.

So this means that one will go up. The other one , the up will turn to one side. And the other one down will turn in the opposite.

Okay. Here we have like a little person that would be like the biturvious man.

Okay. That 's the inch.

Now let 's go to something a little bit more organic. For a lot of people , the masculine and the positive and the feminine in the negative. Why? Because the positive goes out , take the energy out , and the feminine takes the energy in , goes inside.

Easy to understand it. This is a circulation. This is , which takes five minutes. And this is gestation in months.

So now we get it. Basically. Let 's do something there. We have here something there familiar.

So what is this? Overs and U-truths. You 'll know it.

So positive , negative , masculine , feminine.

Okay.

So geology used the poles to be able to neutralize form itself. Biology uses this polarity to be able to follow and keep going through this waste. And a self that is working with its own energy , what it does. It uses its own energy for the activation of the Kundalini.

So through the concepts of nothing void and the everything. Through biology , through geology , through spirituality , through everything. Everything is polarity. Because without polarity , there is no continuous movement.

And if there is no continuous movement , there is no life. What happened when this little person has its churros and is trying to connect. But suddenly appears this other tiny , pit person around. And this person starts to get in love with this person.

So this person also gets in love activates this churros.

So suddenly , the vibration that once was like this , starts to be like this.

So this one starts to get connected with the other one in the same vibration.

So this one is n't in a spiritual path.

So it 's looking for a higher vibration.

So this person does n't have this same high vibration. But this person has this one. The lower one. For person to be connected with this other person.

And be loved. This person must low down its energy. Its vibration.

So it could match.

So it slows down the vibration. Perfect.

Now we 're going to do something really worst. And this third person comes and has a better vibration with this one. Here. Because this person here is trying to do so much work in order to get to this one.

And this one. By the same level here.

So the love is stronger because there 's something that we call resonance.

So what happens is that the vibration is not in the same level.

So what happened here.

Now I have broken my medical feel like I 'm not being able to handle. I was in such a high vibration here. This person was in such a high vibration here. That does n't know how to handle the low vibrations.

Which means this person has no idea how to handle the motions.

So for this person was really typical because it does n't have a storyid. Very well shaped.

So this person only say. Bye. What is broken here? The flux is broken.

The flux is broken.

So it can not be polarity with a broken feel. There is no right petty. There is a called sentence of energy from others. And this is the system that we call duality.

So this is polarity and this is duality. When a person becomes duality , when a person can not find its own axis and depends on other people. Quality means that I divide myself into , I can not find my axis.

So I divide myself into two. And with this third I have like this and with this person I am like that. This is where we call polarity. Which basically is every human that has culture.

That is not being able to be in its own axis is bipolar. We are all basically bipolar by culture. Because in culture everyone was taught to be different with one person and to act different with another person. That is people polarity.

Of course polarity which is a pathology of course which is another thing. That is the last step of a really bad polarity. But mainly we all are. A person that is in the axis , it does n't matter where or with whom the person is is always the same.

So duality would be the concept of not having an axis.

So I am like a pendulum going from one side to another.

So this example that I gave with this people in love is what happened in every level of our world. And that 's why we say this world is in duality.

The reason why this world 's in duality is because we are not finding our axis. Because polities in negative is precisely to find your axis. Quality would be this moment in which I break my axis into.

So I move horizontally looking for the energy of others around and not within myself.

So this is why the law of polarity is the one that tells us that we are all beings. Creating constantly movement. Of course we could be for days speaking about the love polarity because it 's the one that has so many things to talk about. But I guess this is the basis of it.

Just to close this idea how can I find again this axis and to use the polarity. Well basically to read tune yourself again and how do you how can you be able to tune yourself. Well that 's your thing. This is your way.

Everyone each one of you has your own way.

So maybe for some is therapy for some is like changing. Recognizing different way of doing the things by will by love by faith. I do n't know. The only clue to that is that to tune yourself into a different or higher vibration to be in your axis.

Basically you have to synchronized yourself to something that makes you feel good. That makes you feel fine. I can do whatever I can go to any therapy to work with anything if you want. But if once I finish the therapy I go out and I do exactly the same as before.

So emotionally this is like going to doctor to make it diet and once you leave the. Once you go out from from the doctor office you go and buy a nice cream with Novella. I do n't know something like that.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is LLy. The statement for today is I Am the Stairs of Evolution. The code for today is the lower astral.

The deepest part of the subconscious ocean is the dead level of gravity of or of the web of gravitational web of stars. The web of the world is the center of the world where the most pressure is generated. And that shapes the idea of an energetic trap that we tend to call hell. Actually it is the denser pool of the energetic level where we see ourselves trapped only if our vibration is equivalent to it.

Let 's go to the alignment relax. I focus in my breathing. As I let all the weight of my body fall down. I become aware of the place find myself and use my imagination to create a library around me.

For with books and galleries. I become aware that this library is within my subconscious and all this information and data is all the time. It 's all the patterns , experiences , beliefs that I had accumulated through history. All of them are recorded here.

For this are my own Akashi records. And I am it 's only a unique librarian. I recognize that I am here in these registers. For with one intention to find a data useful for my process here and now.

This data is related to that priority that I am unable to use and became a duality. My intention is to find this information of that duality that holds me trapped outside my axis. I feel myself cold by this information.

So I let myself be pushed through the galleries , through the books , searching for it and decide find it. As I find the reason , the pattern of my duality , I take it without any judgment and watch it in my hands. I go now to the main hall for the interest of my unconscious , heading to the office of my conscience. Where I am heading to green clarity consciousness to this pattern I hope.

It is to go a cycle through the stairs of my evolution , watching every life in his experience , science , and science that I would say recognize that every step that I give is a positive and a negative positive and negative life , life , death. Once I am in the office , I am surrounded with light and clarity , so I decided to open the book to see what is the pattern of the light that I am so , to transform again in clarity. In clarity , now I am in the office , I am surrounded with light and clarity , so I decided to open the book. Take a deep breath and I take this book to my second chapter.

I am in the office , and my vibration. I am in the office , and my vibration is in the office. I recognize , I said my intention , to explore this pattern of the light in the tool , and I am in the office. I am clarity.

I am in the office , and I am in the office. I am in the office , and I am in the office. I am in the office.
