## Overview

Today we explore the concept of the inner compass - how we find our true north not by looking outward but by going inward to our core. We learn about Earth's magnetic field, how humans have lost connection with planetary magnetism, and the profound shifts happening now in 2020-2021 as the magnetic north pole aligns with the physical pole.

## Losing the North

We've all heard or said the phrase **"losing the North"** - usually in a conceptual way. But it actually happens **physically**. It really happens.

## The Physical Compass

### How the Compass Works

The compass was an instrument used for long periods. It consisted of:
- A tiny box with water or liquid
- A magnetized needle inside
- The needle points to the magnetic north pole by Earth's magnetic field

The compass helped find north and trace maps, connecting all the places you're heading to. 

In Latin:
- **"Cum"** = all together, everyone together
- **"Passus"** = step

**"Cum-passus"** = Compass - the tool that puts all the places and steps together, connecting all the path.

For cartography, geography, aviation, and sailing, the compass shows where north is, helping you find where you have to go.

### Our Internal Compass

Even with modern electrical tools (also called compasses), we all have this **connection with the north pole inside our bodies**. It's natural for us.

The core of the planet is made of **melted iron**, creating massive electromagnetic fields. We have **iron in our bodies**, mostly in our blood. All this iron is connected to the iron in Earth's core.

## Earth's Magnetic Field

### How It Works

The iron core of the planet creates a magnetic field that expels energy up and down, creating:
- **Positive energy** (north)
- **Negative energy** (south)

Like a huge magnet with north and south poles.

The core usually moves very slowly, but it IS moving. This means the magnetic fields also move with the core's movement. This liquid iron core moves around in the magma, and this movement pushes the magnetic north pole from its position to different places constantly.

### Movement of the Magnetic Poles

Sometimes the core movement is still - the north pole stays in roughly the same area for a long time. But sometimes it moves fast, changing position rapidly, even creating a **switch of poles**.

Some theories say the north pole might switch and move to the south pole. People think the whole planet would flip physically - but **NO, that's not how it happens**. If the planet flipped physically, not even a cartridge would survive - complete destruction.

What actually happens: the nucleus (core) moves faster, so the **magnetic north pole moves to the south**, changing the polarity of the planet.

### Evidence in Mountains

We can know this by analyzing iron movement in mountains. In mountain strata, you can see that the positive part of iron is organized toward the north constantly. Depending on where it's heading, you can see where the north pole has moved through history.

The melted iron core has such powerful magnetism that all iron in the planet is pushed by this magnetism. All iron around the planet moves toward the north pole.

## Human Connection to Magnetism

### How Animals Navigate

Since we have iron within our blood, our bodies naturally align constantly with the magnetic north pole.

Many animals still have this connection with the north pole because they developed through the iron within. In their brains, they have this **compass showing where north is**. That's how they find places - **migration is because of magnetism**.

### How Humans Lost the Connection

Humans started following animals and seasons. We began using other tools:
- Creating maps
- Developing culture
- Talking and sharing
- Drawing and recording

We created many tools to guide ourselves and **lost the ability to connect with planetary magnetism**.

Some people in the past used their own body to:
- Measure magnetism with hands (dowsing)
- Find water underground  
- Determine where north is

But we started losing this connection. We use GPS instead. Suddenly, magnetism stopped being something that helps us guide ourselves in life. Instead, **magnetism became something that makes us feel lost**.

## From Geography to Psychology

### The Compass in the Brain

As with any animal on the planet, we have a kind of **compass in our brain** that balances the brain and helps us find north.

Through history, we stopped being connected with the planet and stopped using this intelligence. Instead of being connected through magnetism in **geography**, we started being connected through magnetism in **psychology**.

When we **lose our north psychologically**, we feel crazy, lost, we don't know what to think. This connects us all as humans - even if we think differently, **our axis and north are the same**. Magnetically, we all head to the same north and connect to the same paradigm.

## Why Is North Important?

Some people ask: Why should the north be most important? If we're countries in the south, shouldn't the south be our north?

**It's not about politics or culture** - it's about biology and magnetism.

When organized magnetically, energy flows **north then south**, north and south. Our biological body with its iron heads constantly toward the north. This isn't political - it's about **finding the north**.

### The Core is What Matters

North and south exist because of the magnetism of the planet's core. **The important thing is the center of the planet, the core.** South and north are just a way of discharging energy.

## The Torus Field

To picture the magnetic field: Imagine Earth inside an apple shape. The **torus** magnetic field (apple-shaped) protects Earth from bad rays and energy from outer space.

When energies from space hit this magnetic field:
1. They break at the field boundary
2. Energy goes into the planet's center like electrical discharge
3. This creates the **northern lights and southern lights** in the sky

## The Human Core: Heart and Solar Plexus

### Our Internal Magnetic Field

The planet has a core (iron center). **We also have a core** - the **heart**. This is the iron core of our own planet (body).

From our heart core, we also have a magnetic field - a **torus**. This magnetic field protects us from magnetic influences from other people and places. It also creates discharge, protecting ourselves.

**If my heart is weak** - not feeling safe, feeling bad - the magnetic field is weak. Everything around affects me.

### Why the Heart is Weak

The core (heart) tries to look for north, tries to reach balance and axis. When it can't find its north, it weakens.

**The compass we have is our own axis, our own self.**

## Finding Your North

### The Misconception

From our cultures and thinking, we believe **north is where we're heading to** - a place or goal to accomplish.

**This is not correct.**

North is not the place where I should go. **North is the place that helps me order myself.**

To find my north, I don't have to go north or south. **I have to go to the core.** The core of a human is the **heart**.

### Why the Solar Plexus?

We're discussing this on Solar Plexus day because the heart and solar plexus **work as one** in the body's core. They're like a polarity working together:

- The **heart** contracts and expands energy
- The **solar plexus** creates the magnetic field around all links connecting you with the external world, others, the world - it's the torus

These two together constitute the **"I Am."** Together, they **calibrate and align the being** - they ARE the compass.

## How to Find My North

To find my north, I must understand:

1. **Where is my heart willing to go?** - What is my heart heading to? Where should I go? What is my heart feeling that it needs?

2. **Who am I connected to?** - What are my attachments? I cannot move because I'm attached to things. I must know which things I'm attached to.

### The Two Actions

To find my north and calibrate the compass:

1. **Heal the bonds** - the links I have with people I'm attached to
2. **Stop moving outside with my heart** - stop trying to reach something external; **be centered in myself**

These two things calibrate the compass.

### How to Do It

Each person is unique and different. Some people will need to:
- Speak with the people they're attached to
- Make ceremony
- Go to therapy
- Find their own way

**I cannot help with this** - each person must find their own way. I've explained the system, but **how you use the system is your thing**.

This is the most difficult part - saying "now you find your own way." This is why religions exist - it's easier to follow steps: first, second, third, then enlightenment. But **that's not how it works**. You have to find your own way. That's the hardest part, but it's the only way.

## The 2020-2021 Magnetic Shift

### Recent Movement of Magnetic North

The magnetic north pole has been moving **faster in the last five years** than in the last centuries.

**Historical position**: The magnetic north pole has been around Canada's north territories and Nunavut for many centuries.

**Year 2000**: The magnetic north pole left land in the Nunavut islands for the first time and started touching the Arctic Ocean.

**Last five years**: The magnetic north pole moved through the Canadian Arctic faster than ever.

**2019**: It moved so fast it went out from Canada's regional boundaries. It's now in the center of the Arctic Ocean, close to the physical north pole. All aeronautics had to change their GPS systems because machines were heading the wrong way.

**2020-2021**: The magnetic north pole will **align with the physical north pole**. This hasn't happened since records began.

### The Hemisphere Shift

At the beginning of 2020, something even more important happened: The magnetic north pole moved through the **zero meridian line** from **west to east**.

For the first time in recorded history, the pole moved from the **west hemisphere to the east hemisphere** - from right to left.

This changed not only polarity but also the **particle**, the wave pattern.

**All humans in 2020 changed the polarity** - the north pole moved from one hemisphere to the other. **This is why everyone is crazy this year** - we've gone through something unprecedented.

### The Crown of the Planet

**The message**: The **crown of the planet is being activated**.

During this change of paradigm, this change of polarity, we had to **stay still, not move**, so we could all align with the planet. **That's why we had quarantine this year**.

**December 21st**: The crown will be set on the planet - **Jupiter and Saturn conjunction** (the Bethlehem Star). Both planets will be in the **first degree of Aquarius**.

This means:
- **Ending of old time**
- **Beginning of the new era**

That day must be coronated (crowned).

### 2021 and Beyond

**This doesn't mean 2021 will be easy.** December 14, 2020 begins **six more months of shadows** - things we couldn't do this year that we must face.

**2021 will be terrible but will give us something** - it will be a great year because it provides opportunity.

### The Importance

The planet is aligning itself this year and next. **We must align ourselves too.**

There's suffering in the world, but remember: **Suffering** comes from Latin **"super-ferrum"** = **under the iron**.

We've spoken about being under pressure of the north pole and iron of the core. **Whoever suffers is whoever is not aligned with the core, with the planet.**

For example, the teacher suffered the whole month because he was not aligned. This is how it works.

## The Dodecahedron Geometry

According to Atlantean tradition, the **dodecahedron** represents the element of **water/life**. Its form delivers the essence of the sphere and shows the main web uniting all existent life.

- **12 pentagonal faces**
- **30 edges** = the values between mountains of the icosahedron, paths of spirit-soul-body
- **20 vertices** = exactly opposite process to icosahedron

Instead of searching the 12 portals, the dodecahedron searches to **send information to the 20 cells of life**.

## Guided Meditation: Aligning with Planetary Magnetism

The meditation connects our core with Earth's core:

1. Begin as seed under ground absorbing nutrients
2. Extend roots deep, leaves upward through forest
3. Rise through Tree of Life toward light
4. Flower above trees, seeing forest and savanna
5. Ascend higher, seeing all animals, forest, horizon, ocean
6. Reach skies with clouds, surrounded by colors
7. Leave atmosphere, reaching space
8. See north and south magnetic fields with northern/southern lights
9. Recognize you're part of that great magnetic field
10. Understand power comes from the center, from the core

**Bring the whole planet with its magnetic field to your solar plexus** - aligning Earth's core with the core of your being.

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Yee

**Statement:** I am the dimension of the masters

**Code:** The Dodecahedron - representing water/life, the web uniting all existence

**Meditation Focus:**
- Recognize your north is within, not outside
- Feel the magnetic field from your head (north) to feet (south)
- Understand you ARE the compass of your being
- Align your north and south within your core
- Find consciousness and coherence in your center
- Your south is mastery, your north is learning - both live within

**Integration:**
Work on two aspects to calibrate your inner compass:
1. Heal bonds and attachments to others
2. Stop seeking externally; center in your own core

Remember: **South = mastery you possess, North = learning ahead. Both live within you in the core. You are your own axis, your north and south, your master.**

**Reflection:** The compass is not a tool to find external directions - it's a symbol of internal alignment. Our true north is not a place to reach but a state of being centered in our core. As the planet aligns its magnetic and physical poles, we too are called to align our internal polarity. The suffering of 2020 reflects collective misalignment as humanity shifts from one paradigm to another. Those who suffer most are those furthest from their core. The solution is not to seek north externally but to dive deep into the heart-solar plexus core, heal our attachments, and center ourselves. When we align with our own axis, we align with the planetary axis, and we find our true mastery and direction emerge naturally from within.
