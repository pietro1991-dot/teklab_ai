## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening. How are you?

So today I was doing the exercise that I wrote in the blog and I was trying to take out the training of the things that I had inside , all expressions and so on. And suddenly I needed the whole day this pain in my mouth like in the teeth. Like I needed to bite something like anger and something like this.

So I was like with a lot of pain in my teeth like I needed to release it somehow.

So a few moments before I just took some wood , the palosanto , I do n't know how it 's called in English.

So I took that , is the only thing that I just grabbed in the table and I was beating and biting it like if it was meat. And it 's been years without eating meat but it 's kind of my teeth needed that feeling of biting something really hard. And I did it a lot and like in a honeymoon and now I 'm feel fine. I 'm feeling fine so nice.

So yes , I had to bite like an animal , biting something , biting something to release all the tension out the body.

Okay.

So let 's begin with information for today.

So you can understand why I 'm beating and biting wood.

So talking topic for today is how do you say , specificity or forgiveness? It 's a specificity. It 's a specificness. Thank you.

So remember this about the word for today. That , X means out and pressed means pressure.

So expression means to get out of pressure.

So what is expressiveness is the ability or the quality to get out of the pressure.

So remember that we have said that expression is related to the energy that we create in our bodies. Whenever we do an action , we take action in something , we do things in our day to life. We are generating energy all the time.

So if we start that energy for ourselves , if we keep , storage in that energy within not being able to get it out , we can get sick. We can get frustrated. We will have so much pressure that we will leave under pressure. We will leave like this , like with many problems in our body , in ourselves , that we can not manifest.

So what we have to do is to let this energy go out to express that energy that we have within many different ways.

So the concept to give away this pressure of energy is expression. Expression is the way in which we can really that tension and manifest that energy that we have within into the outside. Expressiveness , expressiveness , it 's nice. Never said this word before.

Expressiveness is the quality of those who express.

So it means that we know the ways , the tools we can , we know the different ways in which we can manifest this energy in the outside.

So it 's the quality that each one of us have in order to let this pressure that is within to be released into the outside.

So today in the block I wrote about why it 's so hard for us , the topic of expression and how to express the ways in which we express things.

The reason why it 's so difficult for a lot of people to express themselves is because of culture and the morals. Topics that we already spoke in other months before.

So if you want to go deeper into those topics , you have to look for those topics.

So remember these two concepts. The first one culture , culture comes from the word color that means to harvest. It 's related to the cultures. And moral comes from morris that means inhabit.

Like for example the word morale , a place where you leave.

So these two concepts are straight related to expression.

So let 's go to the past first.

So we can understand as always what we are today.

So going back to the past and as a summary of what we have spoken in another moment , remember that we were nomads at the beginning of humanity.

So as nomads we were traveling around in the planet. And basically we kept the communication by traditions. Traditions come from the word trade that is to speak between. To say something between.

So this means that everything was set and the information was set through the. . . The tribes and well going around the planet.

So it was all oral. But once we discover the agriculture , we started to settle.

So that 's why we became sedentary.

So when we became sedentary in one spot , we started to leave according to that region and according to the food that we can grow in that region. That 's why we started to adapt our way of understanding the world according to a place where we leave and according to what we eat in that place. That 's what gave us the culture of our region. And that 's what also gave us the way in which we will leave that culture which is moral , the morality.

So remember that in the past we were not allowed to do something different from this culture or moral because if we do that it could bring us problems , even dead.

So they kept the tradition of this culture and moral morality.

So we could understand how to live properly in that region. Whoever wanted to change that , it put in jeopardy in conflict , all the culture and all the morality.

So everything that was expressed that kept the tradition , the things that we speak about , had to be related with the culture and the morality.

So what happened with this , that the people that thought that had a different way of thinking in these cultures , they just shut up and did n't express all the things that they had within.

So the reason why we shut up was because of fear of not being accepted by this culture or morality or fear to make this culture and morality being jeopardy. This is why even today we have a lot of problems trying to express what we feel what we think , trying to express what we have within , because we are a threat of what others might think about us , what others might say about what we do. And this is because of tradition. Tell me , if you never have gone through this sensation of being a threat to say what I feel , to say you 're expressed what I have inside.

And the reason why we all have gone through that is because of culture , because of the environment that surrounds us.

So now it 's easy to set ourselves in the victim position to say why this happens to me , there are so many bullies around and so on. But let 's give some credit to the society that is like this. Why society attack and judge the things that are different? Because they are a threat , culture and morality were were created because of being a threat of the environment.

They were created to protect from the different things.

So they are a threat , they are not aggressive , they are scared. Looking at this in this way , we can understand that there 's no bad people , there 's people that is care. And basically , if I am attacked by them , is because I 'm scaring them , because what I do is express in things that maybe they do n't like , because they are scared about what I say , or what I do , what I am. And I 'm sorry , as a tiny example , of course that at school , I was the target all the time.

So I was bullied by that. And there was ones that this guy , he was telling me like many bad things and one of the silly things he was like , who would like , who you like and blah blah. And I actually liked him.

So I told him you and that was the last day that anyone said anything to me.

So just because I expressed the truth that was the end.

So what happens here , that expression is a tool for culture and morality.

So eventually , eventually , some of these people that had these expressions that they needed to release , they found out a way in which they were able to express all this , but not. Not offending the culture , not being aggressive to morality. And that place was a spot of security where they could seat and observe all these expressions without being a threat.

So they created what they call a place where you seat and observe the expression. And that 's the theater. Theater means theater observation and there comes from tron that means tron a place where you seat.

So a place where you seat to observe theater , theater and so the theater was one of the hours. Of the arts that allowed the people to express whatever not offending the culture.

So now , this here , this place of expression , the theater theater is the one that allows us to have artistic action.

So this is the artistic arts comes from the Latin arts which is like to order to set to put order on something. And are is action , are action , which means to move forward to move and do something. Yeah , to move something ahead , that would be to move something ahead. To move some to move the order ahead is like putting order into something.

So where is going to put order within in our own expression.

So what what this action , this artistic action will try to order by movement , the humor , we have spoken about humor in another videos.

So remember why the humor , why it will order the humor. Well , let 's go to the idea humor comes from the word human that means wet land. The origin , the origin is humidity and remember that in the ancient times , the people believed that our interior of our body was made with different humor with different liquids. And those liquids were the ones that controlled the water , the soil , the spirit , the emotions and so on.

So that 's why with the time we started to call humor to our states of emotion.

So the artistic action , what it was meant to do is to order the humor within our beings.

So these humor were suppressed , were oppressed in the inside.

So they needed to be expressed through arts.

So there were people in the past that started to be the ones representing how to order these humor within.

So they were the representative of the action and that 's why we call the actors and the actress , which are the people that represent the artistic action in order to express.

So these people were the ones able to show the reality through show the reality through the humor.

So that 's why they started to use humor in order to show stuff that in the reality you would never do. Like love of the king , love of the normal people , do weird things with the gods. You could do whatever you wanted and in that specific spot everything was art. And nobody , nobody , no one could judge that because it was only expression.

So the theater was the place where the actors and actresses were helping the people to live for a while. All the emotions , the hunger , the sadness , the laughter , the judgments , all the different things that you were never never able to do in the normal life. There you could express it , you could see it become reality.

So through history , the theater , now cinema , all the kinds of action of acting skills , would be done as a way to measure the humor of a population to show by fake stories. What is happening in the inside of a society? It 's like the way in which the theaters were used in order to show all these stories outside. To measure how the people were thinking really , but they were scared to do it in the real life.

So for example , something that I was watching the few months ago was this situation like 20 years ago , until 20 years ago , everyone has really clear the difference between the superhero and the villain. And everyone wanted to be the superhero because we knew that the villain was someone doing bad things to the life , to our life to the system.

So suddenly , so we were like all willing to be the one that protects everything the life , the system and so on. The last decade , the theaters , the arts , the cinema , started to show a very different humor of society in which the villain became much more accepted than the actual hero. And in which people started to feel much more related with the villain than with a superhero. Because the villain was against the system.

And the people today is so tired of politicians , of the system and so on. And now we honor the villains that overcome , that go over the system.

So this kind of , of feelings are the ones that the theater , the action is trying to show from the humor of the people. Nobody would go and kill politicians because that 's not something that the people that lives kind of in the center or repressed would do. But in the arts , they show it and everyone 's minds when you see that is like , why? Because usually they are showing a kind of the society humor.

So this means that we have so many things to say that arts repressed or pressed in our inner world. That we do n't know how to tell them or to express them in the real world , but maybe we can do that acting. When we can not do it in the outer world and we take action and we want to take action on that , when we can do is to act to take a part , a role in action.

So this , remember that the body , the soul , the spirit , see the brain , sees everything as an illusion. For the brain is everything in the illusion.

So what you can do is to do that situation as if it is a play in an artistically talking , as if it is a play in which you , in which you do that action , making believe your brain that it is really happening.

So you 're releasing the tension and the energy. That 's a , see-comagic expression in which you just take out all these energies that you have inside and your brain , your brain , your cells , interpreted as real.

So when you have this , this things inside , this repression inside , sometimes the things that you want to say , the person that you want to tell to , there is not very more , maybe that person died , or maybe I would love to bite that person and I do n't , and my culture would say , you do n't do that , that 's weird.

So like I did today.

So what is the solution?

So the solution would be to act that , to make any imagination around acting that situation and taking a part on that.

So your brain and your body will be really thankful for that , because for the body is true.

So for example , you can , you can just let out whatever you have inside , like maybe you just have the need to act like a dog , barking and walking in for pause and , I do n't know , scream like a crazy act your situation.

So the things that usually , you would n't do in front of other people. This is the concept of expressiveness , which is to do whatever you have within and you say , I 'm not good enough to do this , or I 'm scared to do this , but you just do it , it does n't really matter. Just act that , for example , I did n't know to play with piano , I have no idea how.

So I just sit down and do whatever , just play like a kid. And that 's it. Just leave your energy move , that 's the quality of expression , of expression.

So in this way , we can actually let out all the potentials that we have within that by fear , we are not allowing it to go out. I would just recommend you to do this , even if it is a tiny thing , because for some people is easier for some others is really difficult , but do n't redress yourself. If it 's aggression , would you want to express , is aggression , does that matter? If it 's sexuality , it 's sexuality , do n't judge yourself , just do it.

So it 's all about letting , get out the things that you do n't usually would do with other people or in front of other people.

So when you are alone , it does n't really matter , you can do whatever you want , because there is truth that you must know. God is everywhere , so God does n't have morality.

## Q&A

So the task for today is to look for that sacred spot for you that represents the learning , the expression and just do it. Whatever.

So for those who does n't know me , maybe does n't make any sense , but for those who really know me , so they I did it , I was dancing in between the palm trees dancing me dancing. I would never do that , never.

So I was dancing there , and I was screaming to one of the palm trees , saying a lot of that words , thinking about someone , and that 's why it 's all. And so some people were passing by like the nomen and it 's all good , yes , it was all fine.

So that would be expressivity , expressiveness that 's I never said the word. The vibration for today is hey , the same in for today is I am the signer of the music. The code for today is Neptune , and under the sky , the ocean of the emotional consciousness subconscious is found , where all the foundations of our feelings are saved , what makes us be a we can not control. From the indurapian never meaning cloud , where the rains come from.

This is the Latin relation for Poseidon , since sensitivity , the souls deepest , the chaos of the artist with its erratic creativity , the deepest aspect of the circus , are the keys of this world that recalls the depth of the oceans. I become aware of the space that surrounds me , the body that I inhabit , and my own breathing. Below my feet , I observe a divine spark , light that represents my body , and see and die knighted. I bring this divine spark to my feet.

## Guided Meditation

Softly I start to move my feet in circles , activated in the two legs , then move the energy of the two rivers , the white Nile and the blue Nile. From my legs , I send the attention to express the path that inhabits within me. I breathe in the night , this path. I send this spark to my knees.

By unifying these two rivers here , the two stories of the feminine and the masculine that makes me be who I am right now. And I send the attention to express all the history that brought me to hear the heritage that I have within. I breathe in the night my knees is spending them. My rise up is spark to the great lake in my root chara.

With the fighting and vital energy. I recognize this lake , the energy that originates the Kundalini , the origin of the Nile within me. I set the attention to express my word pressed sexuality. I breathe in the night , the root chara expanding it.

I ascended this divine spark to my creative center in the scrum. I observe within me the power of the wound , of the mother of creation , E. C. With the darkness and the lights that makes me be who I am.

And I set the attention to express my darkness and my lights to express my creativity. I breathe in the night the scrum expanding. I rise up my divine spark to the plexus. I contemplate within me the temples of the body of the light , the consciousness of myself.

And I set the attention to express what I am really , what I really am. I breathe in the night the sun , the night the sun. I rise up the divine spark to me through the Nile in me , to the heart. I realize the temple of life and love in my heart , irritating to every living creature.

And I set the attention to express all my emotions and feelings were pressed within me. I express my service to the world. I breathe with night and expand my heart. I ascend this divine spark throughout my throat.

I feel here the temple of the truth , the one that the radiated with the 12 rays , these truths to the entire world. And I set the attention to express my truth to the world. I ascend this spark to my third eye. I am observing the temple of the eyes of the saints contemplating.

I recognize this strength to see beyond. I set the attention to express to the world my ideas. I breathe and expand my ideas to the night in the brain. I ascend this divine spark to my crown.

## Energy Work

I observe the delta of my inner Nile opening with different strains shining with light and in the center the pyramids. I set the attention here to express my beliefs , my philosophy , my spirit to the world. I expand the night in the crown. I recognize that these expressions are the ways that expands the sound , my music to the universe.

Every expression is like a note of violates , creating the music that I am. I am the sign of my music. I take the breath and I take this consciousness throughout my body , stretch it and aside. It is one at the time , come back here and now.

Thank you everybody for being here and another day and see you tomorrow on the same time.
