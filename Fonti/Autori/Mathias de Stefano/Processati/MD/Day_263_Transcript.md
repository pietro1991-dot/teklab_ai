## Overview

Today's teaching begins with a personal example of the power of expression. While doing the expressiveness exercise, intense pain developed in the teeth, like needing to bite something with anger. The solution? Grabbing palo santo wood and biting it like an animal biting meat. After years without eating meat, the teeth needed that feeling of biting something really hard. After releasing this primal energy through biting and acting like an animal, the pain disappeared.

This demonstrates the core principle: when we store energy and pressure within ourselves without expressing it, we can become sick, frustrated, and live under constant pressure. Expression is the way we release this tension and manifest the energy we have within into the outside world.

Expressiveness is the quality or ability to get out of pressure. It's knowing the different ways we can manifest energy in the outside world. Today we explore why expression is so difficult for many people, tracing this difficulty back to culture and morality.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology of Expression and Expressiveness

Expression comes from "ex" (out) and "pressed" (pressure). Expression means to get out of pressure. Expressiveness is the ability or quality to get out of the pressure.

Expression relates to energy we create in our bodies. Whenever we take action, do things in daily life, we generate energy all the time. If we store that energy for ourselves, keeping it within, not able to get it out, we can get sick, frustrated, live under pressure with many problems in our body and ourselves that we cannot manifest.

We have to let this energy go out, to express the energy we have within in many different ways. Expression is the way we release tension and manifest energy from within into the outside.

Expressiveness is the quality of those who express. It means we know the ways, the tools, the different ways we can manifest this energy outside. It's the quality each one of us has to let pressure from within be released to the outside.

### Culture and Morality: The Roots of Expression Difficulty

Why is expression so hard for many people? Because of culture and morals. These two concepts are directly related to expression.

Culture comes from the word "colere" (to harvest). It's related to agriculture. Moral comes from "moris" (to inhabit), like the word "morada" (a place where you live).

Going back to the past, we were nomads at the beginning of humanity, traveling around the planet. We kept communication through traditions. "Tradition" comes from "tradere" (to speak between, to say something between). Everything was oral, information passed through tribes traveling around the planet.

Once we discovered agriculture, we started to settle, becoming sedentary. When we became sedentary in one spot, we started living according to that region and the food we could grow there. We adapted our way of understanding the world according to a place where we live and what we eat in that place. That gave us the culture of our region and the morality—the way we live that culture.

### The Price of Cultural Conformity

In the past, we were not allowed to do anything different from culture or morality because doing so could bring problems, even death. They kept the tradition of culture and morality so we could understand how to live properly in that region. Whoever wanted to change that put in jeopardy the entire culture and morality.

Everything expressed that kept the tradition had to be related with culture and morality. People who thought differently in these cultures just shut up and didn't express what they had within.

Why did we shut up? Fear of not being accepted by culture or morality, or fear of making culture and morality be in jeopardy. This is why even today we have problems trying to express what we feel, what we think, what we have within. We're afraid of what others might think about us, what others might say about what we do. This is because of tradition.

### Understanding the Cultural Threat Response

It's easy to set ourselves in the victim position, saying "Why does this happen to me? There are so many bullies around." But let's give some credit to society. Why does society attack and judge things that are different? Because they are afraid. Culture and morality were created to protect from the environment. They are afraid, not aggressive. They are scared.

Looking at it this way, we can understand that there are no bad people, only scared people. If I am attacked by them, it's because I'm scaring them. What I do expresses things that maybe they don't like because they're scared about what I say, what I do, what I am.

A personal example: At school, being bullied constantly, one guy was saying bad things. He asked, "Who do you like?" I actually liked him. So I told him "You." That was the last day anyone said anything to me. Just because I expressed the truth, that was the end.

### Theater: The Safe Space for Expression

Expression is a tool for culture and morality. Eventually, some people who had expressions they needed to release found a way to express all this without offending culture or being aggressive to morality. They created a place of security where they could sit and observe expressions without being a threat.

They created "theater" (from "theatron"—observation, and "thron"—a place where you sit). A place where you sit to observe. Theater is one of the arts that allowed people to express whatever they wanted without offending culture.

This place of expression, the theater, allows us to have artistic action. "Art" comes from Latin "ars" (to order, to set, to put order on something). "Action" means to move forward, to move something. To move the order ahead is like putting order into something.

Where are we going to put order? Within our own expression. This artistic action will try to order by movement the humors.

### Humors and Emotional States

Humor comes from the word "humus" (wet land). The origin is humidity. In ancient times, people believed our body's interior was made with different humors, different liquids. These liquids controlled water, soil, spirit, emotions.

With time, we started calling our states of emotion "humors." Artistic action was meant to order the humors within our beings. These humors were suppressed, oppressed inside. They needed to be expressed through arts.

People in the past started to be representatives of how to order these humors within. They were representatives of the action—that's why we call them actors and actresses. These people were able to show reality through humor.

They started using humor to show things that in reality you would never do: mock the king, show love between different classes, do weird things with gods. You could do whatever you wanted, and in that specific spot, everything was art. Nobody could judge that because it was only expression.

### Theater as Cultural Measurement

The theater was the place where actors and actresses helped people live for a while all the emotions: hunger, sadness, laughter, judgments—all different things you were never able to do in normal life. There you could express it, see it become reality.

Through history, theater and now cinema have been used as a way to measure the humor of a population, to show by fake stories what is happening inside a society. It's the way theaters show these stories outside, measuring how people are really thinking when they're scared to do it in real life.

For example, 20 years ago, everyone clearly knew the difference between superhero and villain. Everyone wanted to be the superhero because we knew the villain was doing bad things to life and the system. We all wanted to be the one protecting everything.

In the last decade, theater, arts, and cinema started showing a very different humor of society in which the villain became much more accepted than the actual hero. People started feeling much more related with the villain than with the superhero because the villain was against the system. People today are so tired of politicians and the system that now we honor villains that go over the system.

This kind of feeling is what theater and action try to show from the humor of the people. Nobody would go kill politicians because people living in repressed centers wouldn't do that. But in arts, they show it, and everyone's mind resonates with "Why?" because usually they're showing society's humor.

### Acting as Emotional Release

We have so many things repressed or pressed in our inner world. We don't know how to tell them or express them in the real world, but maybe we can do that by acting. When we cannot take action in the outer world but want to take action on something, we can act, take a role in action.

Remember: the body, soul, spirit—the brain sees everything as illusion. For the brain, everything is illusion. What you can do is create that situation as if it's a play, artistically speaking, as if it's a play in which you do that action, making believe your brain that it's really happening. You're releasing the tension and energy.

This is psychomagic expression, where you just take out all these energies you have inside, and your brain and cells interpret it as real.

### Practical Expression Techniques

When you have things inside, this repression, sometimes the things you want to say or the person you want to tell is no longer there. Maybe that person died. Maybe you'd love to bite that person, but your culture says you don't do that—that's weird.

The solution? Act that. Make an imagination around acting that situation and taking part in it. Your brain and body will be really thankful because for the body, it's true.

You can let out whatever you have inside. Maybe you have the need to act like a dog, barking and walking on all fours. Scream like crazy, act your situation. Things you usually wouldn't do in front of other people.

This is the concept of expressiveness: doing whatever you have within. "I'm not good enough to do this" or "I'm scared to do this"—but you just do it. It doesn't really matter. Just act that.

For example, I didn't know how to play piano. I have no idea how. So I just sit down and do whatever, just play like a kid. That's it. Just let your energy move. That's the quality of expression, of expressiveness.

This way, we can let out all the potentials we have within that by fear we're not allowing to go out. I recommend you do this, even if it's a tiny thing. For some people it's easier, for others really difficult, but don't repress yourself.

### Embracing All Forms of Expression

If it's aggression you want to express, it's aggression. Doesn't matter. If it's sexuality, it's sexuality. Don't judge yourself. Just do it. It's all about letting get out the things you don't usually would do with other people or in front of other people.

When you are alone, it doesn't really matter. You can do whatever you want because there's truth you must know: God is everywhere, so God doesn't have morality.

## Practice

### Finding Your Sacred Expression Spot

The task for today is to look for that sacred spot for you that represents learning and expression, and just do it. Whatever. For those who know me, they know I did it—I was dancing between palm trees. I would never do that, never. So I was dancing there, screaming to one of the palm trees, saying bad words, thinking about someone. Some people were passing by, and it's all good.

That would be expressivity, expressiveness.

### Alignment Practice

Become aware of the space that surrounds you, the body you inhabit, and your own breathing. Below your feet, observe a divine spark, light representing your body's consciousness. Breathe and ignite the spark.

Bring this divine spark to your feet. Softly start to move your feet in circles, activating the two rivers—the White Nile and Blue Nile. From your legs, send the attention to express the path that inhabits within you. Breathe and ignite this path.

Send this spark to your knees, unifying these two rivers here, the two stories of feminine and masculine that make you be who you are right now. Send the attention to express all the history that brought you here, the heritage you have within. Breathe and ignite your knees, expanding them.

Rise up this spark to the great lake in your root chakra with fighting and vital energy. Recognize this lake, the energy that originates the Kundalini, the origin of the Nile within you. Set the attention to express your repressed sexuality. Breathe and ignite the root chakra, expanding it.

Ascend this divine spark to your creative center in the sacrum. Observe within you the power of the womb, of the mother of creation, Isis, with the darkness and lights that make you be who you are. Set the attention to express your darkness and lights, to express your creativity. Breathe and ignite the sacrum, expanding.

Rise up your divine spark through the Nile to the plexus. Contemplate within you the temples of the body, the light, the consciousness of yourself. Set the attention to express what you really are. Breathe and ignite the sun.

Rise up the divine spark through the Nile to the heart. Realize the temple of life and love in your heart, radiating to every living creature. Set the attention to express all your emotions and feelings repressed within you. Express your service to the world. Breathe, ignite, and expand your heart.

Ascend this divine spark through your throat. Feel here the temple of truth, radiating with 12 rays these truths to the entire world. Set the attention to express your truth to the world.

Ascend this spark to your third eye. Observe the temple of the eyes of saints contemplating. Recognize this strength to see beyond. Set the attention to express to the world your ideas. Breathe and expand your ideas, igniting the brain.

Ascend this divine spark to your crown. Observe the delta of your inner Nile opening with different streams shining with light, and in the center, the pyramids. Set the attention here to express your beliefs, your philosophy, your spirit to the world. Expand and ignite the crown.

Recognize that these expressions are the ways that expand the sound, your music to the universe. Every expression is like a note of vibration, creating the music that you are.

You are the designer of your music.

Take the breath and take this consciousness throughout your body. Stretch it aside. Come back here and now, one at a time.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Find your sacred spot that represents learning and expression. This could be in nature, a private room, anywhere you feel safe and alone. In this space, allow yourself to express whatever is repressed within you without judgment or fear.

This might mean:
- Dancing wildly when you normally feel self-conscious
- Screaming or saying things you'd never say in public
- Moving like an animal, biting something (safely), acting out primal urges
- Playing an instrument badly, singing terribly, creating "ugly" art
- Acting out scenarios you wish you could live but can't

The key is doing what you normally wouldn't do, especially in front of others. Let the energy move. Don't judge yourself. Your brain and body will interpret this as real release.

### Applying This Teaching

Notice throughout your day when you're suppressing expression. Feel the pressure building in your body. Where does it accumulate? Jaw? Shoulders? Stomach?

Remember that what seems "weird" or "wrong" to express is often exactly what needs to be expressed. Your culture and morality trained you to repress these things, but repression creates illness.

Create regular private time for unrestricted expression. This isn't self-indulgence; it's necessary maintenance for your physical and emotional health.

When you feel judged by others for expressing yourself, remember: they are afraid, not evil. Your authentic expression scares them because it challenges their cultural security. This doesn't mean you should stop—it means you should understand the dynamic and continue with compassion.

## Q&A

### Q: Why is it so difficult for most people to express themselves authentically?

Because of culture and morality. When humans became sedentary and agricultural, we adapted to specific regions with specific ways of living. These cultural patterns were enforced strictly—deviation could mean death. We inherited this fear of expressing anything different from cultural norms. Even today, we're terrified of what others might think or say about what we do.

### Q: If society attacks my authentic expression, does that make society bad?

No. Society is afraid, not evil. Culture and morality were created to protect communities from environmental threats. When you express something different, it scares people because it challenges their security system. They're not attacking you out of malice but out of fear. Understanding this helps you continue expressing with compassion rather than resentment.

### Q: How did theater become a safe space for expression?

People needed a way to express what culture and morality forbade without actually threatening the social order. Theater became a designated space where you could sit and observe expressions without them being a threat. In that specific spot, everything was art, and nobody could judge it as real action. This allowed expression of forbidden emotions, ideas, and actions.

### Q: What are "humors" and why do they need to be ordered?

Humors (from "humus," wet land) are what ancient people called the different liquids in our bodies that control emotions, spirit, and states of being. We still use "humor" to describe emotional states. Artistic action was meant to order these humors within us—to organize and express the chaotic emotional energies we carry inside.

### Q: Why does acting or psychomagic expression actually work for healing?

Because the brain, body, soul, and spirit see everything as illusion. The brain cannot fully distinguish between lived reality and vividly acted experience. When you act out a scenario—even knowing it's "not real"—your cells, nervous system, and subconscious interpret it as real. This creates genuine release and healing.

### Q: What if what I need to express feels violent or inappropriate?

Express it anyway, but in your private sacred space, not harming anyone. If you need to express aggression, it's aggression. If sexuality, it's sexuality. Don't judge yourself. The point is releasing what's repressed. You might bite wood like an animal, scream at a tree, dance wildly, or act out scenarios that would be socially unacceptable. Alone, in your sacred space, God has no morality—you're free.

### Q: I don't know what I need to express. How do I discover it?

Your body knows. Notice where you hold tension—jaw, shoulders, stomach, fists. Notice what you absolutely would never do in front of others. That's probably what needs expressing. Start moving, making sounds, letting your body lead without your mind controlling. What emerges might surprise you. Trust it.

### Q: Won't unrestricted expression make me lose control or become dangerous?

No. Regular private expression prevents loss of control. It's the constant repression that eventually explodes dangerously. By creating safe containers for authentic expression, you release pressure gradually and healthily. This makes you more balanced, not less controlled, in daily life.
