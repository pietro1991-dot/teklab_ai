## Overview

Day 188. Today Matias is traveling to Barcelona, and Malaya is in the pyramid in his place, anchoring the energy while he continues to deliver the teaching remotely. This is a beautiful demonstration of the teaching itself: **You can sail your own ship even when you're not physically in the place you thought you needed to be.**

We connect today with the **sacral chakra**—the center of creativity, generation, sexuality, and emotional flow. And our topic is **Argo Navis**, the constellation of the **ship**.

Argo Navis is a **massive constellation** that was so large it had to be divided into smaller parts:
- **Carina** (the keel—the spine of the ship)
- **Puppis** (the stern—the back of the ship)
- **Vela** (the sail)
- **Pyxis** (the compass)

This constellation is only visible from the **Southern Hemisphere**, which is why many people in the northern hemisphere have never heard of it. But for those in the south, it's a guiding constellation—a reminder of the **journey across unknown waters**.

The Argo Navis is the ship from Greek mythology that carried **Jason and the Argonauts** on their quest for the Golden Fleece. But beyond the myth, the ship represents something profound: **the concept of self-governance**.

To "govern" comes from the Greek word meaning **"to sail."** When you sail, you are free. You are able to guide yourself across the ocean, to navigate unknown territories, to become your own authority.

Today's teaching is about **the hero's journey**, about accepting your own tragedy (not comparing it to others'), and about understanding that **the ship is yourself**—sailing the waves of emotion, pushed by the winds of the mind, guided by the captain (your ego) and the compass (your heart).

And the direction you take? That's determined by **your past**—the rudder is at the back of the ship.

## Core Teaching

### The Story of the Argonauts: The Birth of the Hero

The Argo Navis is connected to the Greek myth of **Jason and the Argonauts**. Jason was tasked with retrieving the **Golden Fleece**, and to do so, he built a ship and gathered a crew of heroes—the Argonauts—to sail with him across dangerous seas.

But this story is not just mythology. It's a **memory**—a psychological and spiritual archetype that captures a truth about human evolution.

For the ancient ones, the sea was terrifying. It was unknown. No one knew what was beyond the horizon. The sea was **an open space that no one could control**.

Until someone said: "I will make a boat. I will jump into the sea. I will cross it."

And when that person did it—when they sailed across the unknown and returned with new experiences, new knowledge, new treasures—they became a **hero**.

This is where the concept of the hero is born: **Someone who leaves the safety of the known, crosses the unknown, and returns transformed.**

And the key tool? **The ship.**

### Self-Governance: The Freedom to Sail

The word "govern" in Greek means **"to sail on a boat."**

This is profound. To govern yourself means **to be able to sail**—to navigate your own life, to guide yourself across the waves, to be free.

When you're on a ship, you are not bound by the land. You are not limited by borders or walls. You are **free**. The ocean is vast, and you can go anywhere—if you know how to sail.

This creates the concept of **self-governance**: the ability to guide yourself, to be your own authority, to take responsibility for your direction.

The hero is the one who learns to sail. The hero is the one who **governs themselves**.

### The Psychological Structure of the Ship

To understand the teaching of Argo Navis, we have to understand the **parts of the boat** and what they represent psychologically.

**The Ship Itself = Yourself**  
The boat is you. Your whole being. Your body, your mind, your soul—all contained within this vessel that is navigating the ocean of existence.

**The Waves = Your Emotions**  
The sea is not calm. It's full of waves—sometimes gentle, sometimes violent. These waves are your **emotions**. They rise and fall. They crash against the boat. They can sink you if you're not careful, or they can carry you forward if you know how to work with them.

**The Wind = Your Mind (Your Words, Your Intentions)**  
The wind pushes the sail. The wind is what creates movement. And the wind is your **mind**—specifically, your thoughts, your words, your intentions. What you say and think creates the force that propels you forward.

If you speak with clarity and intention, the wind is strong and directed. If you speak with confusion and doubt, the wind scatters and the boat drifts aimlessly.

**The Keel (Carina) = The Spine, The Axis**  
The keel is the **spine of the boat**—the central structure that keeps it stable and aligned. If the keel is broken, the boat cannot sail. It will sink.

Your keel is your **alignment**, your integrity, your core structure. If you're not aligned—if your spine (physical, energetic, moral) is broken—you can't navigate. You'll be tossed by the waves and scattered by the wind.

**The Stern (Puppis) = The Past**  
The stern is the **back of the boat**—where the rudder is located. The rudder steers the ship. And the rudder is at the **back**.

This means: **Your past determines your direction.**

The captain stands at the back, holding the wheel, steering based on where the boat has been. Your past experiences, your history, your learned patterns—these are what guide your current trajectory.

You cannot steer from the front. You can only steer from the back.

**The Captain = Your Ego**  
The captain is the one who makes decisions, who holds the wheel, who takes responsibility for the journey. The captain is your **ego**—your sense of "I," your identity, your personal will.

The ego is not the enemy. The ego is the **captain**. Without a captain, the boat has no direction. But the captain must know how to use the compass.

**The Compass (Pyxis) = Your Heart**  
The compass is what shows you **true north**. It's what keeps you oriented even when you can't see the land, even when the sky is cloudy, even when you're lost.

The compass is your **heart**—your inner knowing, your soul's guidance, your true north.

The captain (ego) must **follow the compass (heart)**. If the ego ignores the heart, the boat will sail in circles, lost at sea.

**The Sail (Vela) = The Tool That Catches the Wind**  
The sail is what allows you to **harness the wind**. It's the tool that transforms mental energy (thoughts, words, intentions) into movement.

Your sail is your **ability to take action based on your vision**. If you have big ideas but no sail, the wind passes you by and nothing happens. If you have a sail but no wind, you sit still.

You need both: **vision (wind) and action (sail)**.

## The Hero's Journey and the Tragedy

Here's where the teaching gets deep.

Matias says: **The only way you can live your own hero's journey is if you accept your tragedy as the key to your evolution.**

What does that mean?

Everyone has a tragedy. But we tend to **compare tragedies**, and when we do, we diminish our own struggle.

Matias gives an example from his own life. He says:

"I live very well. I chose to live very well. I can't complain. But suddenly I think: *Does that mean I can't complain about my own tragedy?* Because my tragedy is different from someone else's tragedy."

If you compare tragedies, you'll never evolve. Because you'll think: "My struggle isn't bad enough. Someone else has it worse. I shouldn't feel this way."

But **your tragedy is yours**. It's not about the size or the severity. It's about **what it teaches you**.

The hero is not the one with the biggest tragedy. The hero is the one who **accepts their tragedy** and uses it as fuel for transformation.

Matias being depressed—even though he lives well, even though he's doing meaningful work—is still a real struggle. And it's useful. Because his experience of depression might help someone else understand how to get out of depression.

**You don't need to live in hunger to know that suffering exists. You don't need to experience war to have a valid struggle.**

Every tragedy—no matter how "small" it seems compared to others—is a **key for your own evolution**.

The hero is the one who says: "This is my tragedy. I accept it. I will not compare it. I will not diminish it. I will learn from it."

## Practice

### Sailing Your Own Ship

Today's practice is about **taking the wheel** of your own ship and recognizing the parts that make it move.

**Step 1: Stand as the Captain**  
Stand up. Feel your feet on the ground. You are the captain. You are the ego. You are the one responsible for this journey.

Say aloud: **"I am the captain of my ship. I take responsibility for my direction."**

**Step 2: Feel the Keel (Your Spine)**  
Place one hand on your lower back, one hand on your belly (sacral chakra). Feel your spine—your keel. Is it aligned? Is it strong? Or is it bent, broken, misaligned?

Breathe into your spine. Straighten it. Strengthen it. This is your axis. Without it, you cannot sail.

**Step 3: Check the Compass (Your Heart)**  
Place both hands on your heart. Ask: "What is my true north? Where does my heart want me to go?"

Don't force an answer. Just listen. The heart knows. The compass always points true.

**Step 4: Feel the Waves (Your Emotions)**  
Sway gently side to side, like a boat rocking on waves. Feel the emotions moving through you—sadness, joy, fear, excitement. Don't resist them. **Sail them.** Let them move you, but don't let them sink you.

**Step 5: Raise the Sail (Take Action)**  
Stretch your arms wide like a sail catching the wind. What vision, what word, what intention do you want to catch? Speak it aloud.

Feel the wind (your mind, your words) filling the sail (your action). Now you're moving.

**Step 6: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"Hy"** three times, feeling it resonate in your sacral chakra—the center of creation, generation, flow.

Then speak: **"I Am the Generating Life."**  
You are the ship. You are the journey. You are the life force that moves through the waves, pushed by the wind, guided by the compass.

**Step 7: Accept Your Tragedy**  
Sit down. Place your hands on your lap. Ask yourself: "What is my tragedy? What is my struggle?"

Don't compare it to anyone else's. Don't judge it as "too small" or "not real enough." Just name it.

Then say: "This is my tragedy. This is my teacher. This is the key to my evolution."

Let it be. Honor it. It's yours.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Map Your Ship:**  
Draw a simple boat. Label the parts:
- Keel = my spine/alignment
- Stern = my past
- Captain = my ego/decision-maker
- Compass = my heart
- Sail = my actions
- Waves = my emotions
- Wind = my thoughts/words

Look at your drawing. Ask: "Which part is broken? Which part am I ignoring?"

**Name Your Tragedy:**  
Write down your personal struggle—the thing you're going through right now. Don't compare it to anyone else's pain. Just name it.

Then write: "This is my tragedy. This is my teacher. This is the fuel for my hero's journey."

**Practice Self-Governance:**  
Today, make one decision **without asking anyone else's opinion**. Check your compass (heart), consult your captain (ego), and choose. Sail your own ship.

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching today is: **You are responsible for navigating your own life. No one else can sail your ship for you.**

The waves (emotions) will rise and fall. The wind (thoughts) will blow in different directions. But you have a keel (alignment), a captain (ego), and a compass (heart). If you keep your spine straight, your ego aligned with your heart, and your sail raised, you can navigate anything.

And your tragedy—whatever it is—is not a curse. It's **the key**. It's what makes you a hero. Because the hero is not the one with the easiest life. The hero is the one who **accepts their struggle and uses it to evolve**.

## Aquarius Emotional Week Context

We are in the Emotional Week of Aquarius, and today we connect with the **sacral chakra** (Hy - I Am the Generating Life). The sacral is about creation, flow, sexuality, and the ability to **generate** new realities from within.

The ship is a perfect metaphor for the sacral: You are creating your journey. You are generating your path. You are the life force moving through the waves of emotion, pushed by the winds of thought, guided by the compass of your heart.

This week is asking: **Can you sail? Can you govern yourself? Can you accept your tragedy and still move forward?**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does it mean that "to govern" means "to sail"?

In Greek, the word for "govern" comes from the idea of sailing a boat. When you sail, you are free—you're not bound by land, borders, or walls. You navigate your own course. Self-governance is the ability to guide your own life, to take responsibility for your direction, to be your own authority.

### Q: Why is the rudder at the back of the ship?

Because the rudder (at the stern) represents your past. You steer from where you've been, not where you're going. Your history, your learned patterns, your accumulated experiences—these determine your current direction. You can't navigate without acknowledging where you've come from.

### Q: How do the ego and the heart work together?

The ego is the captain—the decision-maker, the one who holds the wheel. The heart is the compass—the one who knows true north. The captain must **follow the compass**. If the ego ignores the heart, you sail in circles, lost. But if the ego listens to the heart, you reach your true destination.

### Q: What does it mean to "accept your tragedy"?

It means recognizing that your personal struggle—no matter how big or small it seems compared to others'—is valid and important. Don't compare tragedies. Don't diminish your pain because someone else has it worse. Your tragedy is **yours**, and it's the key to your evolution. The hero is the one who accepts their struggle and uses it to grow.

### Q: How do I navigate the waves of emotion?

Don't resist them. Don't try to make the sea calm. Instead, **learn to sail**. Keep your keel (spine) aligned, your captain (ego) listening to your compass (heart), and your sail (action) raised to catch the wind (thoughts/intentions). The waves will move you, but they won't sink you if you know how to work with them.

### Q: What does "I Am the Generating Life" mean?

You are not a passive passenger—you are the ship itself, the captain, the journey. You are the life force that creates, that flows, that moves. You generate your own path. You create your own reality. You are the one sailing the ocean of existence.

### Q: Why is Matias sharing his own depression in this teaching?

Because the hero's journey requires honesty. Matias is showing that even someone who lives well, who teaches profound spiritual truths, still goes through low points. His struggle is different from someone else's, but it's still real. And by sharing it, he gives others permission to accept their own tragedies without comparison.
