## Introduction

What for you thank you hi everyone good morning good afternoon good evening just to to let you know this I I wanted to show you to show you this because it's incredible and important in many ways and just to let you know what it was this is the golden parade of the Pharaohs and it's because today Egypt was was taking the 25 around 25 pharaohs queens and kings from the ancient Egypt from the old Museum in in the in central Cairo to the new Museum of ancient civilizations so it is really it was really special really really amazing I was trying to show you as much as I could well I hope I hope you could see it a little bit and of course it was good in many reasons so it was a really good example of honoring the past so let's begin with the short explanation the topic for today very related to any point of view that you want to take the question for today is what for what for remember that what comes from guo in in the European language that means a thing concrete thing that we are going to speak about and then four comes from the word the Latin word Pro that means ahead something that is in front so what for what for is the question that speaks about the future of things the goal of the things that we do so we have to remember one of the laws of the universe of the universe which is cause and effect so the question why is the one that goes to the origin to the causes of the things and the question what four is the one that goes to the effects of the things to the Future aspects of of something so remember that yesterday when we spoke about the the the question why I explained that it was related to the the origin of things so we have to go to the causes of all things so as much you go to the origin you will find the very beginning and the Very original cause of all things and that means that before that there's nothing is the Eternal origin so this means that there is no other origin or cause to that main cause and this means that there is no past and no present in the beginning of the universe this means that the first time existing is the future the future is all the possibilities of that cause so when you reach the very origin of all the causes you can only find possibilities that comes from that cause from that origin and that's why the next question that someone must do is what for which is regarding the future the future of things the question what for is the one that allows us to find different possibilities and different perspectives of one answer without the question what for we wouldn't be able to find new ways to transform ourselves to change so the question what for is a key that allows us to move forward towards the future so when we think about the future when we usually do is to relate the goal of the future with success and when we think about success is because we start to believe that the main goal of everything in our life is to achieve our goals and to find the purpose of what we are seeking for so when we speak about success this means that we consider success those things that we are looking for like success can be to have money success can be to raise to to reach the top of the mountain success can be to be able to connect with yourself through meditation as success could be I don't know to reach peace inner peace or whatever so from this point of view to achieve a success can be seen from different point of views it's not it is from the from the mental from the emotional from the physical way so is to achieve a goal that we have in our lives so the reason why we think about success in a different way is because we live in a world that have been using the capitalistic idea of the capitalistic idea for globalization according to competition is much more about going to be over the other ones to to reach things physical things to have these competition so we can have all of course a capitalism that is organic but we don't have an organic capitalistic capitalism today we have a capitalism according to competition so this is why we relate success the big the people that that is in the spiritual path or in a much more social path we can we can usually think about success as something that is wrong or something that is bad but for the people that lives in a society like ours today is is not is is good but we have a great mistake regarding the word success because in our society we consider success as a destiny a place where we have to go to something to reach when success really means at Point from where you get out so the concept the concept of success comes from the etymology sequence sequence is the one that follows a sequency of things so success is something that is under other thing and it keeps going and keeps following something new so it's not related to Rich one place but to follow and keep moving from one place to another that's what it means really success in Spanish we have the word exito to describe success which is the same origin of the word exit in English so exit is from where you where you go out so it's not something that you reach is from where you go so this speaks that we have this misunderstanding of of success as being something that you reach that you have when really is the one that is that is telling you that in order to be better you have to transform yourself and to keep moving not to stay in one spot so the one that has really success is the one that transforms constantly itself so once we understand the concept of success we can really get the point the idea of the question what for the question what for is the one that helps me to move forward and to transform myself in questions like I want or or in statements like I want to be rich so the question would be what for and I don't know the answer to be free or to be happy so the question is what for and you keep asking what for once and again once and again so the way the reason why you do this is the same reason why you asked why you ask why to the Past you go back and back and back looking for the origin of things in the past asking why so what for you ask in order to find the answer for the purpose as much you ask what for to everything that you want to do you reach the idea of the purpose the question what for and the idea of success are really one for another why is this because the the main concept of of success is to move forward and the main concept an idea of the question what for is to make you doubt in that objective that goal that you had in your life so when you ask what for what for to each one of of of your goals in life you allow yourself to transform the goal of success so you are really succeeding in your life because you are transcending the previous idea so thanks to the question what for we set ourselves free from the idea of from the idea of this goal of being success successful so we set ourselves free so we can keep moving keep transforming ourselves and not being stuck in the past in one only idea so as I said it's really important for us to ask ourselves what for in order to evolve in our life so now the question what for has two different aspects one connotation which is conditional and another connotation that is unconditional so remember what is condition condition is something that comes from the Latin con di kit which means something that is said by all of us something that we have decided by speaking together so a condition means that we already said something and we decided that this is in this way and we cannot change it so why it is in conditional and conditional is something that wasn't spoke by many and it doesn't really matter what it was said is really free from all the perspectives from everything that was said so now let's go to the Linguistics do you remember what it's what it is a conditional when you write a sentence I don't know if we are going back to school so taking you back to language school let's understand what is a conditional in language is all the sentences that you write with if okay if so for example I'm gonna do this if I do that I can go that place if I go first this place I will do this if I first accomplished that so a conditional is that you are going to do something you're going to do something if there's another thing that allows you to like there must be something more that allows you to do to do what you are aiming to do so that's a conditional they put the music even time louder so now how can we see this conditional in the what for when we say for example what I don't know how to make a sentence sorry the music is making me so what is this goal for if if at the end everything is the same what to say for if never listen so this kind of questions like you are trying to this kind of questions that you are trying to ask yourself what for why do this for if it will never change if it will never happen or this kind of things so those questions are made from the ego the conditional is from the ego so the ego speaks in conditional because the ego is trying to find the is is trying to take the control of all things so the inconditional way of asking what for is like that person that is willing to learn how to do things that is open to all the possibilities and that does the question what is this for what is that for but those questions are in order to find to figure out new ways of doing things so we could say that the what for in a conditional way is from an is a question from an adult that is frustrated in the things that that person is doing and the unconditional what for is that kid that is willing to learn a new way of doing things so now I leave you this question from where do you do the question what for from the condition or the unconditioned you have to make yourself the question so I invite you to write the questions all the questions that you have within that starts with platform foreign just write the questions doesn't matter the answer just the questions and also when you write these questions try to think from where are you writing them are you writing them to be successful on a purpose in your life reaching a goal or are you writing down these questions in order to transform transcend evolve go beyond and be sincere with your questions and answers because I don't really care what are your answers this is not an exam so I don't really care is your problem but you have to figure it out just be sincere with yourself for example today I wrote that my questions in the blog I wrote my what four in the blog and of course that they were from the ego because it was conditional I figured out when as I was writing them so you can judge me because it's public but I'm not gonna read your notes so don't fool yourself be sincere with yourself because I don't really care I I don't care if you say yes I I am unconditional because I'm looking for Transcendence I I don't really care I don't care this is not an exam this is not of being good or being bad no this is just to see how you have with them with yourself so figure out for your own self okay no need to show it to Any teacher so let's read information for today the vibration for today is gay the statement for today is I am coherence vision the code for today is the constellation of boots in its heart this constellation guards the second brightest star on the firmament are tourists its history is the one of the peasant that hurts auxins this means Taurus guiding them so that their strength moves the plow that will open the furrows where the seeds of new worlds will be planted do you
