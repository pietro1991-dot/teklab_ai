# Day 99 - Miriam: The Divine Mother's Message

## Daily Practice Elements

**Vibration**: NEW  
**Statement**: "I am the expansion of every possibility"  
**Chakra**: Ankles  
**Law**: Law of the Third Dimension - The third dimension is the direct manifestation of the trinity. This way, the third dimension projects itself in three spatial directions that we call high, wide, and depth, and three temporal ones that we call future, present, and past. It materializes all patterns from the second dimension and ideas from the first dimension in a world ruled by the inevitable laws of time and space limitations.

## Overview

Yesterday, the energy of Miriam channeled through—the Divine Mother, whose name comes from Egypt ("Mir" meaning love) and Hebrew ("Miriam" meaning the star or light of the sea, also called Stella Maris). This is the first time this energy appeared since August 2015, when the information about the "I Am" project was received and the work we are doing now was initiated. Her presence came to deliver a message about August 22, 2021—the second blue moon during this project. She spoke of three times three (nine months, three seasons) until the third moon, a time when solar storms will challenge the planet and when we must hold the balance by tuning to the heart, creating the strings that protect the Earth Mother.

The message was delivered in Spanish, where all the key words share one root: "cor" (heart in Latin). She said: remember we have an agreement (a-cuerdo), to tune the chord (acorde) to the heart (corazón), to weave (tejer) the network according to the heart. Some people will lose their being, lose their center, if they don't align correctly during this time. The magnetic changes will create chaos and conflicts inside people who are not balanced. Our mission is to shine like stars in the blue veil of the Earth—not as a Christian symbol, but as an ancient human code that represents the Divine Mother across many traditions. We are neurons of the planet, and by speaking here, by sharing, we are talking to the Earth because each one of us is a neuron, and by sharing information, we make synapses—we reconnect the mind of the world.

This day also teaches about the ankles and getting lost. One of the main parts of understanding our destiny is the prediction to get lost in that path. Sometimes getting lost is a gift from the universe, because usually everything we do, all the paths we take, all the destiny we create for ourselves, are more related to what we desire than what really is. Throughout our lives, we design so many paths and destinies, but the universe gives us a gift: the prediction to get lost. When we lose all external points of reference, the only point of reference left is ourselves—the core within. This is how you find yourself: by losing all points of reference from the outside. Each one of us has our own north, our destiny, our goals, but we all share one point of reference: the core of the planet. To connect with the planet, we must stop projecting our own point of reference and connect with what the whole is willing to do. This is the process of detachment.

## Core Teaching

### The Energy of Miriam: The Divine Mother

The name Miriam comes from Egypt: "Mir" means love. It also evolved in Hebrew languages to "Miriam," where "Mir" means like the stars and "Yam" means sea—the star or the light of the sea. This is also called Stella Maris, a name for the Divine Mother. The first time this energy was felt was in August 2015, the day when the information of the "I Am" was received and what we are supposed to do—what we are doing now. Her presence was the one saying what we were supposed to do. To be honest, at that time, there was no understanding of what she was explaining. It was too much to comprehend, so it was necessary to read the comments of people and ask friends, "What do you think it is? What do you think she wanted to say?" Together, we figured out what the message was.

### The Message: Three Times Three to the Blue Moon

First of all, she said there was "three times three," and we will see the second blue moon. Basically, this means that three times three is nine months—like a birth, like the process of gestation, giving birth. Three times three means three seasons from now. Three seasons from now, which is nine months, will be the blue moon, and it's the second one during this project. The first one was October 31, this month, this past week (in 2020). The next one will be August 22, 2021. She was referring to that date.

### Solar Storms and Planetary Protection

One of the other things she said is about what was shown in the vision: the field of the planet with all these strings, like trunks, caught in the middle, and where the ball started to break. What she said is that there will be solar storms that will harm the planet. What we have to do is to hold it in balance by singing, creating again the strings, so we protect the planet, the Mother.

### Some Will Lose Their Being

The other thing she said was that some people will lose their being if they don't do it correctly. To lose their being means to lose the center. Maybe some of the changes, the magnetic changes or something, will create some kind of chaos and problems inside people that create conflicts—they will lose their balance.

### The Heart: Accord, Chord, and Corazón

In Spanish, all the sentences she said have the same root, which is "cor"—the heart in Latin. She said: remember that we had an agreement (a-cuerdo in Spanish), and the agreement was to tune a chord (acorde) to the heart (corazón). That's what it would be. Remember we have an agreement to weave (tejer) the network according to the chord, to tune the heart. All those words in English have different roots, but in Spanish, they all go back to one origin: "cor," the heart. She said, "Remember we have an agreement to weave the network according to the chord, to tune the heart." Just saying "according to the chord," it all goes back to the heart—everything is heart.

### Shining Like Stars in the Blue Veil

The message that she said, "to shine like stars in its blue veil," was related to us shining like stars ourselves in balance in the blue pearl, which is the planet. We are shining from the planet toward the cosmos, and it reminds one of the veil of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico. Just to remind you, it's not a Christian code—it's a human code that comes from way long back in history. There were many divinities with the blue veil and the stars on the blue skin. There are many different beings that represented the Mother like that. It's not just precisely Christian. They all represented the Mother.

### Tuning the Chord for August 22, 2021

There are some people who were sharing that the blue moon is in 2023, but no—yes, there is another one, of course, but there are two ways we call a blue moon: after the seasons or in the calendar. There are two different ways to measure this moon, and she was talking about three seasons, so it's about seasons, not calendar. These three seasons—August 22 is the third moon after three seasons.

What it means to be in balance with the chord: remember, the chord in music is three notes that are related to each other and they sound perfectly harmonious. We have also these three notes that must be aligned that we call spirit, soul, and body. What we have to do in order to sound correctly is to have balance in these three. So what we have to do is to have balance here in the center, in the heart. It's not about how you sing; it's about how is your instrument—if it's in chord or not, according to the chord of the heart.

### How Do We Prepare?

How can we do it? Well, we are doing it every day. That's why we're doing this. We have been doing this since August 4, 2020, and we will be doing this until August 4, 2021, before the date that she said. This is why, through all these alignments that we are doing, we are working every week with mental, emotional, the physical—mind, spirit, soul, and body—every month in different constellations. We are preparing for that. Our goal is to be in perfect balance for whatever happens in that moon, so that in order to find that axis, we have to be very responsible with what we are working each day.

It doesn't matter what exactly could happen that month or that date. What really matters is that in that month, we begin with the Kundalini path, with the path through the spine of Earth. We should be very responsible and in our axis, so we can work perfectly with the Kundalini of the whole planet.

### Our Mission: Neurons of the Planet

Now that we have spoken about the message we received yesterday, it's important to clarify what we are doing here. Even if some people are taking these alignments for themselves and to grow within—which is, of course, something very important—the reason for doing this here, and why we are here every day at the same time doing exactly the same, is because we're getting ready, we are preparing ourselves to accomplish a mission. That's why we have to be responsible with what we do, with how we take this alignment. Because besides this maybe being helpful for your own life, this is for everyone, for the entire planet.

One of the things to share now that we are talking about everything and that this is our mission: to be sincere, very honest with all of you about how this feels. Basically, this work is not done here talking every day with all of you, sharing what is within, because of love to share with humans or love to talk with people. No, to be very honest, this would rather not be done if it were for personality—it would be in another place with plants, animals, and some friends that know people, just a few. Because this is not a very "people person" energy. This is not done here because of you, willing to share with you. This is done for the planet, for the Earth, because the purpose came to this world because of Earth.

But humans—we are the neurons of Earth. If you want to speak with the planet, you have to speak with people. You have to talk with humans, and that's why you have to become also human. So talking to you, by talking to you, is talking to the Earth, because each one of you is a neuron. And by sharing these talks, it is known that the Earth is listening. There is a feeling of responsibility for whatever is shared here, and this responsibility is shared with you in what you are sharing that information to, what you are sharing that for.

Basically, we are neurons of the planet, and we have come to this world to raise the awareness, the consciousness of this planet. But to do that, the neurons must also bring that information, must make synapses. This is our mission: to reconnect the mind of the world. This is why so many people are doing this.

### Working for Earth

We're not doing this just by ourselves. Even if we are sharing information that goes beyond the universe, beyond the Earth, beyond dimensions, to understand that even existence doesn't really matter as we think—everything that we are sharing here is to allow ourselves to be in balance, to be here for Earth, because our goal now is Earth. Sometimes maybe we can think we're doing this to understand the universe, to learn, to do anything for ourselves to understand cosmos, but this is not being done because of that. Because we are working for ourselves in community, we amplify the way in which the Earth is. That's why we have to be responsible with what we are doing every day.

What we are doing here is not just to try to solve our own questions or to talk about different topics because we just want to learn. We are doing this, and everything that is explained, basically, is to try to help ourselves balance, to work blindly as neurons for Earth, because we are. We all chose to be humans. That's why we are humans—to work for that, to be the neurons of awareness.

### Not Control or Manipulation

If there are people here who still believe that we're controlled or manipulated by other beings in other dimensions and that we are being used to do this mission, this purpose, first of all, it would be said to those people to open your mind a little bit and try to transform yourself to understand there's nothing like this, that there is nothing to escape from. If you are here believing that and not willing to change, you're free to go and to clean the energy so we can work freely.

Another thing to be honest about: this is considered a very free person energy because it was able to remember the void. There is a feeling of freedom. Everything that is done is because there is willingness to do it, and there is freedom to do it. This work is done with the matrix, with the network, with the planet, with this physical reality, trying to make it evolve. So just to make it clear: if you are here to try to find a way to escape the system, to light yourself, this is not—maybe it can help you, but the work we are doing together is not for that. Sorry. Maybe another time.

### The Ankles and Getting Lost

What we're talking about today is related to the ankles, to the feet, and about our destiny. One of the main parts to understand about our destiny is the prediction to get lost in that path. Basically, sometimes to get lost in the path is one of the things that the universe is expecting for us to do. Getting lost is basically like a gift from the universe, because usually everything that we do, all the path that we take, and the destiny we draw for ourselves, they are more related to what we desire than what really is.

Throughout our lives, we design so many paths and so many destinies for ourselves, and the universe gives us a gift, a present, which is the prediction to get lost. Basically, to get lost is a gift because it's a moment when we realize that everything that we have created, every destiny that we have designed for ourselves, was just an idea that was not the truth. This is why you may know this important statement that says: to get found, first you have to be lost.

### Detachment from External Reference Points

Basically, during our life, we have so many things we are attached to that we don't really—because we are afraid to be lost, we attach so much to things that we don't allow ourselves to lose ourselves in order to find the truth within. This is why life takes us into crises, so we can lose everything. When we lose everything to ensure that we can make it, we realize there are many things that we are attached to. Suddenly we have no point of reference in life, and we have to start all over again.

When you live that crisis, it reduces all the external points of reference. So the only way is in. The only point of reference is yourself. This is how you find yourself: by losing all the points of reference from the outside.

Each one of you, each one of us, myself, we all have a point of reference that we call our north, our destiny, our goals, our wills. We don't know where we're going to go; we kind of have an idea of what we want to do according to our visions. But all of us have only one point of reference that we share, which is the core of the planet. In order to connect with the planet, what you have to do is to stop projecting that point of reference for your own, for yourself. This takes us to the process of detachment from what we are willing to do in order to connect with what the whole is willing to do.

### Detachment Does Not Mean Abandonment

The image, the idea that we usually mistake: when someone speaks about detachment, it's like we are talking about leaving things behind, it doesn't matter all that. If someone says you have to go to the center or you have to find the center of all things and you have to detach from all the other things in order to go to the core, and if that person says, "I am the core that you have to leave everything for me because I am in the center," it doesn't work like that. According to culture and religion, we are used to thinking that when someone says you have to detach from things in order to find the spirit, to go to the center, if that person says "I am the center," a lot of people think, "Oh, I have to leave everything and follow this person." It's not like that. That's a mistake that we make because in our culture, we did it like this many times.

What it really means to detach from things is not to leave things behind. It's to recognize that you are not living for things—that you are yourself, and you have to go to the core, and through the core you get the power to do what you wish with the things around. It's to take your own power by connecting with the power of everyone. That is what it is—to lose all the external points of reference in order to rely on your own and unique point of reference, which is inside, within.

This is why we need to get lost in our lives in order to find the unique point of reference, which is one. When you find that point of reference within you, suddenly you realize that you are everything, that you are connected to everything, so you are not here to work for the planet or to heal humanity—we are not here for that. We are here because the planet and humans are us, because we are only one. "I am not here for them; I am here because of myself." Being coherent with myself is all that I have to do, and myself is everyone.

## Practice

The meditation today takes you to the core of the Earth to release all external points of reference and find the only true north: the core within, which connects you to the core of the planet and the whole.

**Preparation**: Sit comfortable. Move your shoulders softly and aside. Relax all the tension; let all the weight fall down. Focus only on your breathing.

**Descent of the Light**: Perceive all the light that surrounds you, and at the same time, the skin toward the core of your body. Feel the light within and the light outside becoming one, brighter and brighter, for you are I Am.

**Descent of the I Am**: You are the higher self that goes down to your body, going through the crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacrum, root, knees, and ankles. From the light and the awareness of the I Am within, you manifest your intention: I desire to get lost in order to find myself.

**Journey to the Core**: Take a deep breath and feel the I Am going toward the I Am of the Earth. Go out from your feet to the soil, roots, stones, and rocks, through the crust. Feel the heat of the magma and the pressure, the sea of gold, toward the iron core of the world.

**Losing All Reference Points**: Take a deep breath and become aware of your condition—that there is no point where to go, there is no one north for you. There is only this: the only destiny. Become aware that each moment of your life that you have lost is exactly the same moment when you found yourself.

**Vibration**: From the core, vibrate the sound **NEW** repeatedly.

**Statement**: Repeat: "I am the expansion of every possibility. I am the expansion of every possibility. I am the expansion of every possibility."

**Recognition**: Expand this consciousness through the body of Earth:

*"Where I was lost, there I found myself. In the shadows, I saw the light. Along the path, I found my steps. I found myself in the abyss of existence. There I saw the truth. For everything that I projected outside the axis would return. I am the light. I am the truth. I am the power. I am the destiny."*

**The Sixth Dimension Speaks**: Feel the presence from the sixth dimension:

*"It is the only thing that is noticed—it is to know. And in the wisdom, to light, to will, light fills me. For need it explore the darkness of the desert. Time, it only matters its intention. Intention takes you to awareness of responsibility called coherence. It's very important for you to shut up your mind and voice and listen to the beat of your heart. For what is for you an emotion, for us is a clock. On the day when all the clocks are set the same time, we will know. Maybe for some dimensions, this is the game. But here, you listen: time has come. Take it."*

**Return**: Take a deep breath and slowly stretch the body. Bring this consciousness, this awareness, through each part of your body. Go to the heartbeat. Open your eyes when ready.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Tonight before sleep, ask yourself: "What external points of reference am I attached to? What north, what destiny, what goals am I clinging to?" Write them down. Then imagine losing all of them—what's left? Only you, only the core. This exercise prepares you to find your true reference point within, which is the same as the core of the planet. When you lose all external reference, you find yourself.

### Applying the Wisdom

Throughout your day, when you feel lost, confused, or without direction, remember this is a gift. Instead of panicking or clinging to old reference points (goals, plans, destinies), pause and go inward. Ask: "What is the core showing me? What does the whole will?" This is detachment—not leaving things behind, but releasing your grip on external reference so you can find the true north within, which connects you to everyone and everything.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Who is Miriam, and what is her significance?**  
A: Miriam is the Divine Mother. Her name comes from Egypt, where "Mir" means love, and from Hebrew, where "Miriam" means the star or light of the sea (Stella Maris). This is not just a Christian code—it's an ancient human code representing the Divine Mother across many traditions. Many divinities were shown with a blue veil and stars, representing the Mother. This energy first appeared in August 2015 when the information about the "I Am" project was received.

**Q: What is the significance of August 22, 2021?**  
A: Miriam spoke of "three times three"—nine months, three seasons—to the second blue moon during this project. The first blue moon was October 31, 2020. The second will be August 22, 2021. She said solar storms will harm the planet, and we must hold balance by singing, creating strings that protect the Earth Mother. Some people will lose their being (lose their center) during magnetic changes if they don't align correctly.

**Q: What does it mean to "tune the chord to the heart"?**  
A: In music, a chord is three notes that sound perfectly harmonious together. We have three notes that must be aligned: spirit, soul, and body. To sound correctly, we need balance in these three, centered in the heart. It's not about how you sing but whether your instrument is in chord, in tune. We've been preparing since August 4, 2020, working weekly with mental, emotional, physical (mind, spirit, soul, body) in different constellations to be in perfect balance for August 2021.

**Q: What is our mission here?**  
A: We are neurons of the planet. We came to raise the awareness, the consciousness of Earth. To speak with the planet, you must speak with people, because humans are the neurons of Earth. By sharing information, we make synapses—we reconnect the mind of the world. This work is not just for personal growth; it's for the entire planet. Everything shared here is to help us balance as neurons for Earth's consciousness.

**Q: Why is getting lost considered a gift?**  
A: Because usually everything we do, all the paths we take, all the destinies we design for ourselves are more related to what we desire than what really is. Throughout our lives, we design so many destinies, but the universe gives us the gift of getting lost—a moment when we realize everything we created was just an idea, not truth. To get found, first you have to be lost. Getting lost removes all external reference points, leaving only yourself as the reference. That's how you find yourself.

**Q: What does detachment really mean?**  
A: Detachment doesn't mean leaving things behind or abandoning everything to follow someone who says, "I am the center." That's a mistake we make based on culture and religion. Detachment means recognizing you're not living for things—you are yourself, and you have to go to the core. Through the core, you get the power to do what you wish with the things around. It's taking your own power by connecting with the power of everyone. It's losing all external reference points to rely on your own unique point of reference within.

**Q: What is the core, and how do I connect with it?**  
A: Each of us has our own north, our destiny, our goals. But we all share one point of reference: the core of the planet. To connect with the planet, you must stop projecting your own point of reference and connect with what the whole is willing to do. This is detachment from what you're willing to do in order to connect with what the whole wills. When you find that point of reference within you, you realize you are everything, connected to everything. You're not here for the planet—you are the planet. You're not here for them—you are here because of yourself, and yourself is everyone.

**Q: What did the sixth dimension being mean by "time has come"?**  
A: He said that for us, emotion is like a clock for them. When all the clocks are set to the same time, they will know. For some dimensions, this is a game, but here, time has come. He asked us to shut up the mind and voice and listen to the beat of the heart. Intention is what matters—intention takes you to awareness of responsibility, called coherence. It's very strict from the sixth dimension: the three (body, soul, spirit) must be aligned like the hands of a clock for a specific moment. This is not a game for them—when they say you have to be aligned for a specific moment, you better do so, because it's the moment.
