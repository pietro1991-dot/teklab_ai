## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

I hope this has been well.

So , let 's begin. Just by. An explanation of what happened yesterday. In the channeling.

So , let 's begin by the name. She presents itself as Miriam. Miriam. The name Miriam comes from Egypt , which is Mir.

That means love. And also , it will involve in the Hebrew languages that is Miriam , Mir meaning like the stars. And Yam meaning sea.

So , the star or the light of the sea. I also call that the Stella Marks. A name for the Divine Mother. Well , that 's the origin of the name.

So the first time that I felt this energy that I was expressing yesterday was in August 2015. The day when I received the information of the AM and what I was supposed to do. And what we are doing now.

So , her presence was the kind of saying what we were supposed to do. To be honest , I had no idea. I could n't understand anything about what she was explaining. I was just too , we explained it.

## Q&A

And so , I had to read the comments of people. And also to ask some friends , what do you think it is? What do you think she wanted to say? And we were trying to figure out what was the message.

This is what I 'm going to share. Next , what we think. First of all , she said there was three times three. You will see the second blue moon.

So basically this means that three times three is nine months. It 's like a bird , like the process of gestation.

So , giving birth. And she said three times three. This means that three seasons , three seasons from now. Three seasons from now , which is nine months , three.

And again three , which is the third moon.

So the third moon.

So three times three is three seasons. We 'll be the blue moon. And it 's the second one during this project. Because the first one was October 31 , this month , this past week.

And the next one will be August 22 , 2021.

So she was referring to that date. One of the other things that she said is about what I was watching , which she showed me was like , they do n't feel of the planet with all this , reach like this , this trunks. It was kind of caught in the middle and then where the ball started to break.

So what she said is that there will be solar storms that will harm the planet. And what we have to do is to hold it in balance by singing , creating again the strings.

So we protect the planet , the mother. The other thing she said was that some people will lose their being. If they do n't do it correctly. And to lose their being , it means to lose the center.

So maybe some of the changes , the magnetic changes or something will create some kind of chaos and problems inside the people that create conflicts. Loose their balance.

So basically what she said in Spanish , in English we have many different words to say what she said. But in Spanish all the senses that she said all about one word , which is called this. Curtis means heart in Latin , the heart.

## Energy Work

So she said , all that I 'm going to say in English , they , it in Spanish , they have all the same root which is heart.

So it 's remain that we had an agreement. And the agreement was to tune a chord to the heart.

Okay? That 's what would be.

So remember that we had an agreement. According to the heart , that we , to tune ourselves in order to , to weave to , to sue a t-shirt.

Okay? All those words? All those words were , did you hear in English? I repeated in any case.

The sentence , all the sentences that was in Spanish , you can see it with one only origin of the word , which is called this , the heart. She said , remember that we have an agreement to weave the network according to the courts , to tune the heart. That 's what she said , just saying according to the court , it all goes back to the heart , everything is heart.

So the message that she said to shine like stars in its blue veil , it was related that we to shine like stars ourselves in balance in the blue pearl , which is the planet. She 's shining from the planet towards the cosmos and it reminds me the veil of the , of the wadalupe and the urging and Mexico.

So it 's kind of like that.

So just to remind you that it 's not a Christian code , it 's a human code that comes from way long , backing history. There were many divinities with the blue veil and the stars on the blue skin.

So there are many different beings that were presented the mother like that , it 's not just precisely a Christian. And they all represented the mother.

So basically what I 'm going to explain now , I am just talking with my friends today because I had no idea what she meant with this until we spoke until I spoke with them and I got clarified. And it 's about that basically what she said is that we have to be aligned in our court.

Now we 're court , July 22nd , not August 22nd , 2021. And I will explain what it means to be aligned in the court.

So there are some people that were sharing that the blue moon is in 2023 , but no , it 's , yeah , you have another one , of course. But there are two ways when we have called blue moon is after the seasons or in the calendar.

So there are two different ways how you mentioned this moon and she was talking about three seasons.

So it 's about seasons , not calendar.

Okay , so these three seasons , the 20 second , August 22nd is the third moon after three seasons.

So what it means to be in balance with the court.

So remember , the court in music is three notes that are related to her and they sound perfectly harmonious.

Okay , so we have also these three notes that must be aligned that we call spirit , soul and bottom.

So what we have to do in order to sound correctly is to have balance in this three.

So what we have to do is to have balance here in the center , in the heart.

So it 's not about how you sing , it 's about how is your instrument , if it 's according or not , according to the court of the heart.

So how can I do it? Well , we are doing it every day. That 's why we 're doing this. We are doing this since August 4th this year and we will be doing this until August 4th next year before the dates that she said.

This is why through all these alignments that we are doing , we are working every week with mental , emotional , the physical mind , the spirit , the soul and the body , every month in different constellations.

So we are preparing for that.

So our goal is to be in perfect balance for whatever happens in that moon.

So that in order to find that access , we have to be very responsible with what we are working each day.

So it does n't matter what exactly could happen that month or that date. What really matters is that in that month we begin with the Kundalini path , with the path through the spine of earth.

So we should be very responsible and in our access.

So we can work perfectly with the Kundalini of the whole planet.

Now that we have spoken about the message that we 've received yesterday , I would like to clarify this about what we are doing here. Even if some people are taking these alignments for themselves and to grow within , which is , of course , something very important. There is n't why I 'm doing this here and why we are here every day at the same time doing exactly the same. It 's because we 're getting ready , we are preparing ourselves to accomplish a mission.

So that 's why we have to be responsible with what we do , with how we take this alignment. Because besides this is maybe helpful for your own life , this is for everyone , for the entire planet. One of the things that I want to share now that we are talking about everything and that this is our mission , what we are doing now. It 's to be there is sincere , very honest with all of you , about how I feel about all this , about doing this mission.

Basically , basically , I just want to share with you that I do n't really do this here talking every day. Talking every day with all of you sharing what I have with all of you because I love to share with humans or because I do n't know , I love to talk with people and so on. No , I have to be very honest. I rather not do this , if it would be for my personality , I would be in another place with plants , animals and some friends that know much people , just a few.

Because I 'm not a very people person.

So I 'm not doing this here because of you , I 'm willing to share with you. I am doing this for the planet , for the planet , the earth because I came to this world because of earth. But humans , we are the neurons of earth.

So if you want to speak with the planet , you have to speak with people. You have to talk with humans. And that 's why you have to become also human. And I am a human.

So I talk to you because by talking to you , I 'm talking to the earth because each one of you is a neuron. And by sharing my talks , I know that the earth is listening.

So I feel myself , they 're responsible for whatever I could share here. And I also would like to share this responsibility with you in what are you sharing that information to. What are you sharing that?

So basically , we are neurons of the planet. And we have come to this world to rise the awareness , the consciousness of this planet. But to do that , the neurons must also bring that information , must make synapses.

So this is our mission to reconnect the mind of the world. And this is why so many people we are doing this.

So this is also the thing that I want to share to be honest because we are doing here. We 're not doing it just by ourselves , even if we are sharing information that goes beyond the universe , beyond the earth , beyond dimensions , to understand that even existence does n't really matter as we think. Everything that we are sharing here is to allow ourselves to be in balance to be in balance to be here for earth because our goal now is earth.

So that 's why I wanted to be honest with this because sometimes maybe we can think that I 'm doing this weird in this altogether because we want to understand the universe , we want to learn , we want to do anything for ourselves to understand cosmos , but I 'm not doing this because of that. Because we are working for ourselves , because I would want to share what I have within this basically and in this because with you , with me all together we amplify the way in which the earth is.

So that 's why we have to be responsible with what we are doing every day.

## Q&A

So this is why I just wanted to say that what we are doing here is not just to try to solve our own questions or to talk about different topics , because we just want to learn. We are doing this and everything that I explain basically is to try to help ourselves to balance. To work blindly as neurons for earth because we are. We all choose to be humans.

That 's why we are humans to work for that. To be the neurons of awareness.

So.

Another thing that I want to say is that if there is people here that still believe that we 're control or manipulated by other beings in other dimensions and that we are being used to do this mission this purpose.

So first of all I would tell to those people to. Open your mind a little bit and try to transform yourself to understand. There 's not like this that there is nothing to escape from. And.

If. You are here. Believing that and not willing to change so. You 're free to go and to clean the energy.

So we can work freely.

So another thing to be honest is that. I consider myself a very free person because I was able to. I was able to remember. My void.

So I feel. I feel. And everything that I do is because I 'm willing to do it. And I feel free to do it.

And I work. What I do it work with the matrix with the network. With the planet with this physical reality trying to. Make it evolve.

So just. To.

So just to make it clear if you are here to try to find a way to escape the system to light yourself.

So this is not. Maybe can help you but. The work we are doing together is not for that.

So.

Sorry. Maybe another time. And. And.

What I want I wanted to share all this also because.

Sometimes even if we think that we know where we 're going. What really happened is that we are very lost. And. One of the things that we are talking today is.

, related to the ankles defeat. And how. Um. What is our destiny.

So one of the main parts to understand about our destiny is. It 's prediction to get lost. In that path. And basically sometimes.

To get lost in the path. Is one of the things that the universe is expecting for us to do. There is n't why. To get lost is basically like a gift for the universe is because.

Usually everything that we do all the path that we take. And the destiny is that we drove for ourselves. Um. They are more related to what we desire.

Then what it really is.

So this is why. Throughout our lives we designed so many paths and so many destiny for ourselves. And the universe gives give us a gift. A present which is.

Prediction to get lost. And. Basically. To get lost.

And the gift because. Is a moment when we realize that everything that we have. Created every destiny that we have designed for ourselves was just. An idea that it was not the truth.

## Daily Practice Elements

This is why you may know this. And the thing that is important. The statement that says. To get found.

To get found. First you have to be lost.

So basically during our life. We have.

So many things we are attached to. That we do n't really. Because we are fed to be lost.

So we attached so much to the things. That we do n't allow ourselves to lose ourselves in order to. Find the right within.

So this is why life takes us. In decreases.

So we can lose everything. And when we lose everything. To ensure that we can make it. And also really many things that are.

To be attached to.

So. Suddenly we. We have to. We have no point of reference in life.

And we have to start all over again.

So.

So basically when you. Leave that price is reduced all the. External point of reference.

So the only way is in.

So the only point of reference is yourself. This is how you find yourself. By losing all the point of reference from the outside.

So each one of you , each one of us , myself , we all have a point of reference that we call our north , our destiny , our goals , our wheels. We do n't wear what we 're going to go. We kind of have an idea of what we want to do according to our distance.

So , but all of us have only one point of reference that we share , which is the core of the planet.

So in order to connect with the planet , what you have to do is to stop projecting that point of reference for your own , for yourself.

So this takes us to the process of detachment from what we are willing to do in order to connect with what the whole is willing to do.

So the image , the idea that we have to understand that we usually mistake is when someone speaks about detachment it 's like we are talking about the living things behind. It does n't matter all that. And if I say you have to go to the center or you have to find the center of all the things and you have to death of all the other things in order to go to the core. You mentioned if I say that I am the core that you have to leave everything for me because I am in the center.

It does n't work like that because according to culture and religion , we are used to think that when someone says you have to death from the things in order to find the spirit to go to the center if that person says I am the center , a lot of people we think , oh , I have to leave everything and follow this person. It 's not like that. That 's a mistake that we make because in our culture we did it like this many times. What it really means to death things is not to leave things behind.

It 's to recognize that you are not living for things that you are yourself and you have to go to the core and through the core you get the power to do what you wish with the things around. It 's to take your own power by connecting with the power of everyone. That is what traditions to lose all the external point of reference in order to rely on your own and unique point of reference which is inside within. This is why we need to get lost in our lives in order to find the unique point of reference which is one.

When you find that point of reference within you suddenly realize that you are everything that you are connected to everything so you are not here to work for the planet or to heal humanity or we are not here for that. We are here because planet and humans is us because we are only one.

So I am not here for them. I am here because of myself.

So being coherent with myself is all that I have to do. And myself is everyone. If a version for today is new.

Today for today is I am the expansion of every possibility. The code for today is the third dimension. The third dimension is the direct manifestation of the 30. This way the third dimension projects itself in three special directions that we call high , wide , and depth.

And three temporal ones that we call future present and past. Materialized old patterns from the second dimension and ideas from the first dimension in a world ruled by the inevitable laws of time and space limitations. And we came to move my shows softly. And aside , relax all the tension , I let all the weight fall down.

Focus in only in my breathing. And perceive all the life that surrounds me. And at the same time , the skin towards the core of my body. I feel the light within and the light outside becoming one brighter and brighter.

## Energy Work

For I am I am. I am the higher self that goes down to my body. Going through the crown. With her eye.

Light fills me with Def need explore the到了 of the desert , The time , it only matters , it 's intention. Intention takes you to awareness of responsibility , called hearings. It 's very moral. For you to shut up your mind and voice and listen to the beat of your heart.

For what is for you an emotion for us is a clock. On the day , when all the clocks are set the same time , we will know. Maybe for some dimensions. This is the game.

But here , you listen. Time has come. Take it. Take a deep breath.

And always stretch the body , bring this consciousness as awareness through each part of it. Just go to the heartbeat. Thank you for being there and see you tomorrow.
