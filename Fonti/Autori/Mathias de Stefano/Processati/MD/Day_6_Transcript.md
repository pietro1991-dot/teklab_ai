## Core Teaching

### The Portal of Creation

The sacrum chakra is the center of creativity and transformation. By anchoring the energy of the "I Am" into this chakra, we activate our potential to create and manifest reality. The vibration "Mu" opens the portal, allowing the flow of creative energy and the integration of experiences.

### Contemplation and Transformation

Contemplation is essential for transformation. By reflecting on our experiences, we can modify and recreate reality, integrating lessons and expanding our creative potential. The process of exhalation symbolizes the release and transformation of energy, making space for new creations.

### Preparation

1. Find a comfortable position, relax your body, and close your eyes.
2. Focus on your breathing, inhaling and exhaling slowly through your nose.
3. Visualize the oxygen nourishing every part of your body.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Massage your body gently, stretch, and yawn to prepare for the download of information.
2. Scan your body for areas of discomfort, pleasure, heat, or cold. Observe without judgment.
3. Recognize the emotion present in your body, and allow yourself to feel it fully.
4. Notice the first thought or idea that arises, and gather it with the emotion and bodily sensation as spheres of light.
5. Place these spheres at the height of your sacrum, and contemplate their meaning together.
6. With another deep breath, push these spheres into the core of your sacrum, nourishing the seed of creation.
7. Visualize the light of your higher self descending through all activated chakras, merging with the spheres in your sacrum.
8. Observe the chakras radiating light, and allow the spheres to dissolve and be absorbed by the seed of your sacrum.
9. Recognize that these tools nourish your creativity and activate the matrix within.
10. Set the intention to become the creator of your own reality, and affirm: "I Am the Portal of Creation."
11. Visualize the seed blossoming into a beautiful orange flower, activating your sacrum and the network of orange flowers around the planet.

13. Discharge energy from your sacrum to the earth, massage your body, stretch, and open your eyes to return.
