# Day 128 - Chakra Activation

## Introduction

Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you. Thank you everybody for being here another day in this after this meeting that we had , regarding the special month of December. For those who have n't been in that video that we have been doing right now , I recommend you to look for it , which you will find in this same channel , under the name December the end of the day or December the end of the year.

So later you will see it.

## Energy Work

So today we are aligned with the Chakra of Is related to the topic of connection.

So maybe you will ask why connection related to the Is instead of the Chakra , which is the one where we usually put the connection.

So the reason is because a connection is not about to speak with other dimensions or to be connected with a divine or whatever. It 's not that kind of connection. A connection by itself means two different things that are connected one to another.

So concepts , things topics , whatever that is related and linked one another.

So what is a connection? Connection comes from the Latin Gum Nexus. This everything is all together , that 's what means it 's a community. It 's a common , it 's something that connects many things.

And Nexus is the origin of the word not. Not needle and net. Yes , is the origin of this word which is connected to the idea of nodes , a point of connection with many things.

So a connection is many not linked to each other.

So it 's a common connection with a connection with a connection with a connection that we have had in the universe and we always mention which is the inside project in the outside.

So from the inside into the outside , we have a link.

So the inside projects itself in a connection with the note of the outside and the outside is looking to connect with the inside.

So this connection is the sharing information of these two different concepts.

So then these two concepts , this two polarity , will be projected and divided in so many other reflections that it will start to link and create much more connections all around creating a network.

So a network would be this not of distributed around but linked to one another by this vibration and polarity.

So this is what it starts to create a network which is a constant interaction between not in the creation.

So basically a network is a connection.

## Q&A

So now the question would be , what is the thing that appears to create a not? Why a not exists?

So remember that in the universe when this starts to expand when it starts to express , it creates a wave of vibration and this vibration , it expands through all the universe like an ocean. But it generates this movement like in waves.

So this vibration starts to create this appearance of waves that we call frequency.

So this means that the universe from the very beginning expand itself in vibrations that express themselves in different frequencies.

So remember we have spoken about this in a previous video but just as a summary , vibration represents the space and the frequency represents the time.

So just picture this that this wave of existence time and space is exactly the same thing.

So what are time and space are just two different dimensions of one thing.

So as lower is the frequency the closer you are to the past as faster it moves the frequency.

So the closer you are to the future.

So this vibration goes into one direction but there is a moment when it 's like kind of turn back to itself like an echo and it turns back and start to move like from above.

So this movement of this vibration is this wave. Yes , is the one that depending on the movement , the speed of the movement it will transform itself from a wave into a particle creating energy.

So when this vibration moves fast and it 's a lot of energy the energy starts to bend itself and by this movement like bending once again it creates structures. And it creates geometry , okay , so the patterns.

So one of the things that happens in this moment. What that happens in this moment is that the vibration , the energy of the vibration , it starts to create this duality of positive and negative and this positive and negative are the ones that divide the concept of time and space.

So in this moment , in this moment is when the time starts to be seen as the frequency and space as the vibration. And this is the thing that starts to manifest and create the curving of time and space which is like a NA. Deriving this to as this as two it creates also that this one has a positive and the negative and the positive and the negative.

So the positives of this one starts to find and to look for the negative of this one and the positive of this ones are looking for the negatives of this ones.

So that 's why they start to bend to each other to connect to each other. This is what we call the bending of time and space.

So as many more this this conjunction this bending. This bending of the time is the one that starts to manifest and create many other options.

So this is what we spoke the other day of the bending of time and space that starts to create like this bending of the reality like the. The female notches spiral the or expiry that start to bend itself many times opening itself or closing itself in different dimensions. This gives an option for many realities to emerge.

So this diversity creates so many positives and negatives that it starts to bend in order to try to touch all the negatives and positives to each other.

So this curling movement is the one that starts to create this NA chain that starts to bend itself like curling constantly and spiral way that creates this appearance of the chromosome.

So to this conjunction of time and space that are bending to each other like this is what we call not. I 'm not of time and space.

So according to this all the can all the dimensions of the universe they are like twisted like this in. In a knot okay. Where all the dimensions are together. All this conjunction of.

Of information which for us is not. Creates such a huge amount of energy moving around. That we now can call it. A node.

A node.

So these. Notes. Our. Thousands of them in a universe that is stored in information all around spreading in thousands.

So by polarity they start to exist all around the universe. And that makes them to. Be linked one another with by this replication.

So it 's to all this. Notes around of time and space linked one another that we call. Connection. Which is a conjunction.

## Energy Work

Of. Nexus. Notes are interdimensional portals. Because the notes are basically all the dimensions through time and space.

Curling and bending. One another.

So a node is a conjunction of information. And some of the links. Go away and by polarity they connect with others.

So each one is like a neuron. And the links are. The. Synapses.

So this would be. A. Conjunction of. Of.

Notes and to this conjunction of notes is what we call. Network.

So basically. The everything that exists in the universe are just. By creations and frequencies. Time and space interacting.

One another like. Curling. By polarity. Connection and network.

Throughout the whole cosmos.

So this means that we humans. We are also this network. We are a conjunction of notes. And the main ones are the ones that we call charts.

Which are portals. In between dimensions that generates energy.

So as we have this charts. And this notes. Connecting. Into.

Our body. We also have this connection with the notes of other people. In a network of people. This network of people also connect with the notes of nature.

So we have a natural network. And the natural network connects with the planet.

So the planet our network. And the planet our network connects with all the rest of the planets in the solar system.

So a sum. Network. And then the sun connects also with other portals. And what we call.

The star. The stars. Network. The galaxy.

Network. We are all constantly interacting. By connection. Connection is the one that has created our history and our reality.

This is why we connect today with needs. Because needs are the ones that holds the information of all this path of duality that we have. Taking.

So now.

Something that maybe seems like not connected. But. When there 's call. Is because the atoms starts to violate.

Slow. And whenever you feel hot. Is because the atoms starts to move faster.

So it 's just about vibration. Just about that.

So what used to happen when things. Get. Cooler. That things starts to.

Contract like. I. Contraction. Of the atoms.

We would say like if the atoms starts to. To go. Like contracting. What happened when there 's hot.

Well , things starts to move faster. And they expand. They start to. Open up.

And grow. What happened now that. This. Information.

This. Interdimensional. Notes. Of time and space.

Also when there is low vibration. They. Experience. Contraction.

And when there is. High vibration. They expand. It 's themselves.

So a note. Shares information. When it 's as flexible. Note.

So. I know. Shares information. If it 's wide.

But if it. Gets. Contracted. It becomes.

And not. Stop being a node. And it becomes. And not.

So this is how we can interpret it. That when I have a low vibration. My charts close. And when I have a high vibration.

My charts open.

So what this means. That when I. By red low. I lose the connection.

And with I. By red high. I. Getting back the connection.

So when we speak about. Rise your. Raise your. Frequency.

It 's not about. Going up into another dimension. To raise your frequency. To help.

The knots of time and space to spread. And to be more flexible.

So to have a low vibration. Is to be close. Depressed. Sad.

With. With. With. With.

And to be in a high vibration. Would be. To be happy. To share.

To love. To. Are willing. To do things.

Another way we can feel that I am vibrating low is when. You lose the connection with others. You can not share with others. You you can not feel emotions.

You can not feel. Any kind of connection with anything. Hmm.

So what happened if we go low. And low and very low. This not contract so much. That suddenly breaks.

And when it breaks is like a like an injury in between the dimensions. What we call like. The. Darkness or something like that.

The bad things. Crisis. And what happened. Otherwise if I am completely.

In a high vibration.

So so so so high so high.

So high so high. And what happened. Otherwise if I am completely. In a high vibration.

So so so so high so high. That suddenly this construction starts to. Sten external. Sten and suddenly it 's nothing more nothing and starts to.

Disappear and suddenly I am not connected with anything anymore.

So this is why in order to have this connection. We have to. Keep the balance in between things.

So now in. In the test that we have in the planet which is to reconnect the notes of the planet. The goal would be. The goal would be.

To know that the notes of the planet are like not now. Like they are compressed stuck in the past stuck in. In the. In the structures of history.

So what we are doing here where we are trying to do with all the words that every people is doing is to rise up the vibration. To rise this harmony this frequency.

So this notes can be. Why. And the new information coming from the stars. Can be absorbed by the information and transform our history.

## Q&A

What of the tasks that we have is to recognize that as we people need something new in our lives. The planet. Is. Also.

Need in something new in its life. Imagine in your own life. Imagine that someone new is coming to your life. And you are willing to receive something new.

But all your notes are closed. Because of fear. Because of. I do n't know.

Any emotion , low emotion. You do n't want to suffer anymore or whatever.

So you are closed. And. This person has something new for me. Has something.

Good to give me. But I am so. I 've read. My charges are so close.

That I am not. Allowing it to give it to me.

So that person just. Leaves. And I lose the opportunity. To receive something new.

How many of you have lived.

Something like that.

So now. As you have faced this person that just left away. In this month. We are living this.

This process of absorbing this information. With these. With these. Eclipse.

That we are going to have in the. The. Alignment of Saturn and Jupiter in. December 21st.

And Solstice. All this. Information that is coming. Towards us.

We 'll go through the planet. Because the planet is. Close. The Charts are closed.

We 're going to talk in history.

So if the planet is not open.

So we are going to lose the opportunity. To receive all that new data.

So what do we have to do to prepare ourselves? To rise up the vibration of all those notes. And in order to do that. What we have to do is exactly things like we are doing.

We are doing everyday here. Alignment , working ourselves , mediating , allowing the flow of the charts , working our coherence.

So this is why the connection that we are gon na do will be in August next year when we all have done all the elements to work on the opening of this , notes.

So all the things that we are doing here and also all the things that you do with other people , working with other masters , like other therapists or anyone or anything that you are doing , it 's helping you to be aligned for that moment.

So this is why the goal that we have to reconnect the planetary network of consciousness is to work with the notes , the notes that we have within our beliefs , our feelings , emotions and our actions. Hmm? If we send energy to those notes through unconscious and uncohirants , it does n't work because the notes does n't need energy , they need coherence. This is why we have to work with the core hearings.

Because the only way you ca n't align something that is in uncohirants is with coherence.

So we have plenty of time , but this is part of the preparation.

## Energy Work

So I hope I made myself clear about what is connection. Right now I am getting this too. That this is why we are opening the portions of time and space. February , 2022 , till February , 2022 , is the portal of time and space.

## Practice Structure

And in between , we are going to work day by day with coherence.

## Energy Work

So it 's the portal of time and space working the coherence every day.

## Q&A

So when you may ask , how do I work my coherence? Well , we are doing this every day. Every day.

So let 's get moving. This is why we are here working with the coherence because what we have to see to understand is our our healing of our own history and the history of the ideas that we have created in the world because the notes of the planet are lot , by these patterns of history that we have all created through time.

So that 's why we have to work with it.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is you. The statement for today is I am the dimension of time. The code for today is the truncated cube.

The figure originates from the raptor of the cubes vertices. Appearing eight new triangular faces , being this way a total of 14 faces , eight triangular and six octalomals. With 36 edges and 24 vertices , those the cube expressed the interdimensional energy in matter or originating the energetic pattern that will channel all the possible aspects of the beam , creating the personality , emotions , attributes , and all the bounds with other beams.

So let 's go to the alignment. We focus in our breathing. And we start to stretch the body a little bit to relax. And we start to stretch the body a little bit to relax.

The more we can , the more we can relax when they have calm down. It helps us move forward. It helps us create pressure. And I believe that we can practice to the end of my work.

I recognise myself as a seed. I 've Product Enutrains of the around. Created rules. Deep into the deer and rising bow to the forest and its animals.

I grow up through the branches and leaves searching for the light of the sun , a sign , sick for flower. With my hands I accompany the flower , a size seen out , the forest firm above the savanna and its animals. A side grow higher , I contemplate the entire savanna , the entire rainforest , the coast and the sea , a sea reached the clouds. I feel surrounded by the yellow light of the sun , the white color of the clouds , the light blue of the skies and they absorb them , all of them in my flower.

Take the breath and the seagull up , they go through the atmosphere , reaching the space and looking out the light that your search and for is now shining in the air. The sun rises up , I can see now Africa , Europe , Middle East , Asia. The sun goes around the planet , I see the Americans , Pacific Ocean , Oceanian , and Antarctica.

Now I can see the entire network of time , the torus of the poetical field of the planet , the sea and the light of the sun that was sent today , creating this beautiful northern and south of the lights and the poles of the planet. Egypt , Greenland , Siberia , Hawaii , Galapagos , Narnia , the sun , the sun , the sun. Middle East , French Polynesia , the Ahead of Fuel , Antarctica.

Softly , I take this earth and the snow of time between my hands and I bring it in between my knees and there I calibrated all the notes in connection with minds. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time.

I see the time. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time.

I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time. When I am the sun , I observe the color of the sun.

I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time.

I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time. I am the dimension of time.
