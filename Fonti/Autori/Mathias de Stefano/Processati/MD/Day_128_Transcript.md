## Overview

Today we explore the true nature of connection - not as spiritual channeling, but as the fundamental network of nodes linking all existence. We learn how time and space curl and bend to create knots of information, how vibration affects these connections, and the critical work needed now to open planetary nodes for the December 2020 alignment.

## What Is Connection?

### Not Spiritual Channeling

Connection **is not about speaking with other dimensions** or being connected with the divine. It's not that kind of connection.

**Connection** by itself means **two different things that are connected one to another** - concepts, things, topics, whatever that is related and linked to one another.

### Etymology: Con-Nexus

**Connection** comes from Latin **"Cum Nexus"**:
- **"Cum"** = everything all together, community, common
- **"Nexus"** = origin of the word "knot," "needle," and "net"

Connected to the idea of **nodes** - a **point of connection with many things**.

**A connection is many knots linked to each other** - a common connection with connections, creating a network.

## The Inside-Outside Connection

One of the most important connections we always mention: **The inside projects in the outside.**

From inside into outside, we have a **link**. The inside projects itself in connection with the **node** of the outside. The outside is looking to connect with the inside.

This connection is the **sharing of information** between these two different concepts.

Then these two concepts, these two polarities, will be **projected and divided into many other reflections** that start to link and create much more connections all around, creating a **network**.

**A network is knots distributed around but linked to one another by vibration and polarity.**

This creates a network - a **constant interaction between knots in creation**.

## What Creates a Knot?

### Vibration and Frequency

Remember: In the universe, when it starts to expand and express, it creates a **wave of vibration**. This vibration expands through all the universe like an ocean, generating movement like waves.

This vibration creates the appearance of **waves** - what we call **frequency**.

The universe from the beginning expands itself in **vibrations** that express themselves in different **frequencies**.

**Quick summary:**
- **Vibration represents SPACE**
- **Frequency represents TIME**

**Time and space are exactly the same thing** - just two different dimensions of one thing.

### Frequency and Time

- **Lower frequency** = closer to the past
- **Faster frequency** = closer to the future

This vibration goes in one direction, then it's like an **echo** - it turns back to itself and starts to move from above.

This movement of vibration - the wave - depending on the movement and speed, will **transform from wave into particle**, creating **energy**.

### From Energy to Structure

When vibration moves fast with lots of energy, the energy starts to **bend itself**. By this bending movement, it creates **structures** and **geometry** - patterns.

When this happens, the vibration and energy start to create **duality of positive and negative**. This positive and negative divide the concept of **time and space**.

In this moment:
- **Time** starts to be seen as **frequency**
- **Space** as **vibration**

## The Curving of Time and Space

This starts to manifest the **curving of time and space** - like a DNA structure deriving into two.

This creates positive and negative aspects. As two creates more polarities:
- Positives of this one look for negatives of that one
- Positives of that one look for negatives of this one

They start to **bend toward each other to connect**. This is **the bending of time and space**.

### The Spiral

As more of this conjunction, this bending happens, it creates more options. This diversity creates so many positives and negatives that they start to bend to try to touch all negatives and positives to each other.

This **curling movement** creates a DNA chain that bends itself like **spiraling constantly** - creating the appearance of a **chromosome**.

This conjunction of time and space bending to each other like this is what we call a **KNOT** - a **knot of time and space**.

## Knots: Interdimensional Portals

### What Is a Knot/Node?

According to this, **all dimensions of the universe are like twisted together in a knot** - where all dimensions are together.

This conjunction of information (which for us is a knot) creates such a huge amount of energy moving around that we call it a **NODE**.

### Network of Nodes

**Nodes** - thousands of them in the universe - store information all around, spreading in thousands of locations. By **polarity**, they exist all around the universe.

These nodes, linked one to another by replication, create a **NETWORK**. **Connection is a conjunction of nexus/nodes.**

**Nodes are interdimensional portals** because they are basically all dimensions through time and space curling and bending one to another.

**A node is a conjunction of information**, and some of the links go away and by polarity connect with others.

### Neural Network

**Each node is like a neuron.** The links are the **synapses**.

This conjunction of knots/nodes is what we call **NETWORK**.

Basically, everything that exists in the universe are just:
- Vibrations and frequencies
- Time and space interacting with one another
- Curling by polarity
- Connection and network throughout the whole cosmos

## The Human Network

### We Are Networks Too

We humans are also this network. We are a **conjunction of knots/nodes**. The main ones are what we call **chakras** - portals between dimensions that generate energy.

As we have chakras and nodes connecting our body, we also have connection with the nodes of **other people** in a **network of people**.

This network of people connects with the nodes of **nature** - a **natural network**.

The natural network connects with the **planet** - a **planetary network**.

The planetary network connects with all rest of planets in the **solar system** - a **solar network**.

The sun connects also with other portals - the **stars network**, the **galaxy network**.

**We are all constantly interacting by connection.**

## Connection Creates History

**Connection is what has created our history and our reality.**

This is why we connect today with **knees** (feet area) - because **knees hold the information** of all this path of duality we've taken.

## Temperature and Vibration

Something seemingly unrelated but important:

### Cold vs. Hot

- **Cold**: Atoms start to vibrate slow
- **Hot**: Atoms start to move faster

It's just about **vibration**.

### Contraction and Expansion

What happens when things get **cooler**? Things start to **contract** - contraction of atoms (atoms contracting).

What happens when there's **hot**? Things start to move faster and **expand** - they open up and grow.

### Nodes Contract and Expand

This information, these interdimensional knots of time and space - when there's **low vibration**, they experience **contraction**. When there's **high vibration**, they **expand**.

**A knot shares information when it's a flexible knot** - when it's wide.

But if it gets **contracted**, it becomes a **knot** (tied tight). It stops being a node and becomes a **knot** (blocked).

### Vibration and Chakras

When I have **low vibration**, my chakras **close**.

When I have **high vibration**, my chakras **open**.

When I vibrate **low**, I **lose the connection**.

When I vibrate **high**, I **get back the connection**.

## What "Raise Your Frequency" Really Means

When we speak about **"raise your frequency,"** it's NOT about going up into another dimension.

**To raise your frequency** is to help the **knots of time and space to spread and be more flexible**.

To have **low vibration** is to be:
- Closed
- Depressed
- Sad
- Unable to connect

To be in **high vibration** is to be:
- Happy
- Willing to share
- Loving
- Willing to do things

### Feeling Low Vibration

Another way to feel you're vibrating low: You **lose connection with others**. You cannot share with others. You cannot feel emotions. You cannot feel any kind of connection with anything.

## When Knots Break or Dissolve

### Going Too Low

What happens if we go **low, low, very low**? The knot contracts so much that suddenly it **breaks**.

When it breaks, it's like an **injury between dimensions** - what we call "darkness," "bad things," **crisis**.

### Going Too High

What happens if I'm **completely in high vibration** - so, so, so high?

This knot starts to **stretch eternal**, and suddenly there's **nothing more** - it starts to **disappear**. Suddenly I'm **not connected with anything anymore**.

### The Need for Balance

This is why, in order to have connection, we have to **keep the balance between things**.

## The Planetary Work: 2020-2021

### The Task

Right now, the task on the planet is to **reconnect the knots of the planet**.

The goal: To know that the **nodes of the planet are like knots now** - compressed, stuck in the past, stuck in structures of history.

What we're doing here, what every person is doing everywhere, is to **raise up the vibration**, to raise this harmony, this frequency.

**So these knots can be wide**, and the new information coming from the stars can be **absorbed** by the information and **transform our history**.

### The Need: Something New

One of our tasks is to recognize: As we people need something new in our lives, **the planet also needs something new in its life**.

Imagine in your own life: Someone new is coming to your life, and you're willing to receive something new. But **all your knots are closed** because of:
- Fear
- Low emotion
- Not wanting to suffer anymore

You're closed. This person has something new for you, something good to give you. But **you're vibrating low**, your chakras are so closed that you're **not allowing them to give it to you**.

So that person just **leaves**. You **lose the opportunity** to receive something new.

**How many of you have lived something like that?**

### The December Eclipses and Alignment

As you've faced this person who left away, **in this month**, we're living this process of absorbing information with:
- **Eclipses** coming
- **Alignment of Saturn and Jupiter** on **December 21st** (solstice)

All this information coming toward us will **go through the planet**. But the planet is **closed** - the chakras are closed, trapped in history.

**If the planet is not open, we're going to lose the opportunity** to receive all that new data.

### What to Do to Prepare

**To rise up the vibration of all those knots**, what we have to do is exactly things like we're doing every day here:
- **Alignment**
- **Working ourselves**
- **Meditating**
- **Allowing the flow of chakras**
- **Working our coherence**

This is why the connection we're going to do will be in **August next year** when we all have done all the elements to work on opening these knots.

All things we're doing here, and all things you do with other people (working with other masters, therapists, anyone, anything) - **it's helping you be aligned for that moment**.

## The Goal: Planetary Network Reconnection

The goal to reconnect the **planetary network of consciousness** is to work with the **knots** - the knots we have within our:
- Beliefs
- Feelings
- Emotions
- Actions

### Not Energy - Coherence

If we send **energy** to those knots through unconscious and incoherent states, **it doesn't work** because the knots don't need energy - they need **COHERENCE**.

This is why we have to work with **coherence**. The only way to align something that's incoherent is with **coherence**.

### We Have Time

We have plenty of time, but this is part of the **preparation**.

## The Portal of Time and Space

**February 2022 to February 2022** is the **portal of time and space**.

In between, we're going to work **day by day with coherence**.

**It's the portal of time and space, working coherence every day.**

### How to Work Coherence

You may ask: "How do I work my coherence?"

**We're doing this every day.** Every day we're working with coherence.

What we have to do is understand: Our **healing of our own history** and the **history of the ideas we've created in the world** - because the knots of the planet are locked by these **patterns of history** we've all created through time.

That's why we have to work with it.

## The Truncated Cube Geometry

The figure originates from cutting the **cube's vertices**, appearing **8 new triangular faces**, being this way:
- **Total of 14 faces** (8 triangular, 6 octagonal)
- **36 edges**
- **24 vertices**

**The cube expressed the interdimensional energy in matter**, originating the energetic pattern that will **channel all possible aspects of the being**, creating:
- Personality
- Emotions
- Attributes
- All bounds with other beings

## Guided Meditation: Network of Time

The meditation focuses on breathing and connection:

1. Focus on breathing, stretch to relax
2. The more calm, the more we can relax
3. Recognize yourself as seed
4. Absorb nutrients of ground
5. Create roots deep into Earth
6. Rise toward forest and animals
7. Grow through branches and leaves, searching for light
8. Accompany flowering with hands
9. See forest from above, savanna and animals
10. Contemplate entire savanna, rainforest, coast, sea
11. Reach clouds
12. Feel yellow light of sun, white clouds, light blue sky
13. Absorb them in your flower
14. Go through atmosphere, reaching space
15. Realize light you searched for is now shining on Earth
16. See Africa, Europe, Middle East, Asia
17. Go around planet: Americas, Pacific, Oceania, Antarctica
18. **See entire network of time** - torus of magnetic field
19. **See northern and southern lights** at poles
20. See **key nodes**: Egypt, Greenland, Siberia, Hawaii, Galapagos, Norway, Middle East, French Polynesia, Ahead of Fuel (Antarctica?)

**Take Earth and knots of time between your hands** - bring it between your knees and there **calibrate all knots in connection with yours**.

**Reflection:** Connection is not mystical communion with spirits - it's the fundamental structure of reality itself. Everything exists as nodes in a vast network, linked by the curling of time and space into knots of information. Our chakras are interdimensional portals, and our vibration determines whether these nodes are open (flexible, sharing) or closed (contracted, blocked). The planetary nodes are currently locked in historical patterns, compressed and unable to receive the new cosmic information arriving through the December 2020 eclipses and Jupiter-Saturn conjunction. Our daily work of coherence, meditation, and alignment is not just personal development - it's planetary service, preparing the global network to receive transformation. We cannot send unconscious energy to locked nodes; we must work with coherence to help them open. Each of us is a node in the human network, connected to the natural network, planetary network, solar network, galactic network. By raising our vibration through joy, love, and willingness to connect, we help open not just our own nodes but contribute to the opening of the entire planetary grid. The work is preparation for the portal of time and space opening in 2022, but it requires daily dedication to coherence now.
