## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good evening , good afternoon in that order. How are you? I hope everyone is fine.

So if you see anything different in my head , I went to the headresser today.

So maybe that 's something if anyone noticed.

So let 's begin with today topic. Information for today is how to say it in English. The version. I will talk about the version , most than fun.

Okay , can be also fun , but the topic will be more diverse.

So taking some benefits of the information for today , we decided to just do something fun. And suddenly we found a place where there is so much fun things to do , but we decided just to buy some things and then go to the headresser and take some fun over there. It was really fun. It even does n't seem so.

We love a lot and we decided to do many things tomorrow too that are really fun.

So we were aligned with the topic.

So today , when we sat in the pyramid in the morning , we were connected with the womb of the universe with , to be connected as one. And suddenly I just remember just realized that , yesterday , we spoke about bread and how to share the bread represents this unity.

So when we share the bread , we are sharing this unity.

So everyone of us as individuals can recognize the unity.

So I was wondering in the pyramid. I was wondering inside why do we have to divide , why do we have to divide in all of this parts , if we are unity and all we are looking for is unity.

So the universe said , through the pyramid , said , well , the universe is calling this because everyone is looking to come back to the unity.

So universe means that the unity is coming back to itself. But the universe in the very beginning is not called universe , is called diverse. Because diverse means to divide in two.

So it comes back to the duality. It begins to create the duality.

So that 's why the way in which the action that the cosmos takes in order to create , to manifest , is the diversion. And that 's why the universe does all of this to get fun.

So let 's begin with these two concepts. The first concept is universe. The second concept is diverse. They are coming from the same origin.

Universe means unity which is one in Latin , uns.

So one and ver sus means that thing that turns and bends on itself.

So everything that is bending to itself is coming back to the one that it 's universe. It 's everything turning and bending back to one.

Okay , so that 's what universe means.

So the universe is only one thing. But remember that we had already spoken about how the universe divides itself into.

So we have to do inside outside negative positive. It 's put to create duality.

So this is two. And here comes the concept of diversion or diverse. The verse is comes from di which is the di which is the contraction of dual. Which is two in Latin.

Okay , d is two. And ver sus means that bends itself again. But this time the universe is not bending towards the core to the one. But it 's bending towards the outside.

So it starts to divide itself in different things.

Okay , so that 's diversion.

Okay. And separates creating clarity and so manifest in by duality.

So the image would be. Universal. And diversion.

So here comes these two qualities of each one of them. The quality will be for the universe that you need a very CT. And for the diverse will be the diversity.

So what is university? University is the attribute the quality of a place where you joined all the knowledge , all the different topics , all the things that you can have in the world to acknowledge the world to understand every information , everything. You just put it all together in one spot and you connect them all together in one.

So that would be the quality of the universe to put all the different things together. And that 's what we call university. And then we have another quality of the universe , which is the university. The university will be the concept that you realize that even if all the different things of the universe are not in just one place , I can understand the logic that connects all of that.

So even if they are not put in one spot , they are even though all connected through the cosmos as one. That 's universality.

So in the other hand , we have diversity. The diversity is the quality of the diverse , which means that even if you are not in a state of mind , that even if you put all together in one spot , someday this unity that you put all together , all this information that you put all together , there would be people that got this information , but then they will spread anyway in a different way.

So maybe the same people , the people that came to learn the same information , they will go to the world and do it in a different way. Do it in a primitive way , respecting the originality of each one of them.

So diversity would be to find the originality in each one of the individuals that got information.

So this means that the quality of the diverse is to generate thousands of options of one only thing.

So remember this from the origin of the universe. The universe is one , only one being. That 's it.

So what is the logic on saying that the universe is trying or reaching the one , if the universe was already one , why was the goal or the idea to create all the things that it created? There 's no logic on that if the goal was to be one.

So for the universe , the goal was never to be one , because the universe knows that it is one. The goal of the universe is to acknowledge the different potentialities of the one. What is the one able to do? And in order to compare what is possible to do , it needs to reflect to itself , to see a comparison.

And that 's how it divides into options that start to reflect on one another , creating different options of the unity.

So it starts to diverse.

So this means that as much more diversity , much more capacities.

So picture this , that when we are trying to say that we all have to be equals , that we all have to be aware that we all have to live with all the things that we need.

We are going exactly against what the universe is looking for.

So the universe is never saying you all have to be the same. You all have to act and do exactly as the same. It 's not that it takes your shit. The universe is constantly creating new things.

So when we usually are against some kind of diversity , we are kind of going against the will of the universe. I do n't know if you have noticed this , but every time that in humanity we try to do something egalitarian. To do this exactly the same altogether , it end up being a disaster. For example , empires , the data ships , communism 's , religions , fraternities , brotherhood , sects , cults.

Everything that tries to put all together in altogether doing the same , it end up being a disaster.

So why we have to push forward something like that to push forward the idea of to motivate , to motivate the idea of encourage. Thank you. That 's why we have to encourage the diversity because as much diversity we grow faster. We 'll evolve faster with diversity.

The biggest and fastest process of evolution in humanity have been the moments of greatest diversity.

So for sure you know that when you have the same family reproducing itself constantly the same , they start to have problems in the genetics. They start to have diseases or conflicts in the genetics. But when you share chromosomes with other groups and you open to the diversity , the body starts to be stronger , that 's better.

So that 's why this is not just a philosophical concept , this is a physical and physical and a genetic concept.

So this is why it 's so important the mix of races , languages of cultures , because that gives us much more evolution. The birth of diverse would be to diverse in English. But the concept of action of diversity is what we call diversity , diverse , which is another word for fun. It 's an old word for fun.

You do n't use it much for that , but it 's connected.

So this concept of the version which is getting fun is related to the understanding that the universe is trying to connect the different links with everything. And the universe is just a game. It 's playing a game all around with the reality.

So if the universe is playing somehow in the reality , the universe is trying to play with this reality.

So in order to understand the creation and how to be connected with the creation , we have to love more. We have to be more open to other things , because when you love when you enjoy , you relax the body , your being is relaxed and you 're open to receive much more information , to share much more information.

So you start to be permissible to communicate with different things , and that 's the key to diversity.

So today in our societies , we are like , I do n't know what is happening with our society and diversity. The diversity is important. But we are just so serious about diversity. It 's so serious that we are just thinking about We have to be serious about this and we have to respect the diversity and diversity because diversity of gender and diversity of religion.

But we are so serious that we do n't know what to say to not offend anyone. And suddenly , diversity that we are supposed to be fun and enjoyable.

Now it 's all about serious things and you should not say anything to bother anyone and suddenly it 's like , oh my god , if I say it 's something maybe they will kill me if I did something wrong.

So we are so confused with this and diversity is about to live in fun.

Today , today we have this conflict with diversity. And what we are just doing right now is exactly the same as the fascism before. The fascism was to not allow everyone to think different or to love or to do something , something diverse. Because you have to think all like this , so everyone was so serious because it was like , if I say something they will kill me.

Okay , that 's fascism.

So we brought the idea of fascism into diversity and that 's not the right way. Because to be diverse is to just be flexible to love , to allow to communicate , to accept the different point of views , to let the others feel free in this diversity. That 's diversity. Otherwise , it 's fascism.

## Q&A

So someone , someone asked today , if we have to get fun , why there are some other beings that are channeled them , they 're so serious or , or they are , even you can tell that they are mad. But no , it 's not like that. It 's not that they are mad , it 's because they are neutral. They are neutral , so they can not feel duality , so they do n't feel diversity.

So some of them are very still , very straight , because they can not understand the duality.

So they just speak direct. It seems like mad , but it 's not mad. They do n't feel any motion. They do n't feel anything.

Basically.

So another important thing to say about this is that when we are talking about being in another dimension , it does n't mean that they are already gone through all the process that we did.

Some of them , they have never come , they have never come into planets like this one.

So they have no idea how it is to have endophrings , how it is to feel laughter. They do n't have that information.

So they are very far away from that.

So we are the ones here in diversity.

So we are in diversion , given fun.

So we can teach them how to feel that.

Okay , so this is the process of teaching and learning.

So diversity , the diversion is a key to creation , a key to manifest. We have to remember that we are living in this reality , and our goal is to create an euriality. And the reality we are living in is about creation , manifesting , manifestation.

So if we are here to create a new reality , we have to use the tools of this reality. And the tools of this reality is polarity , which is expressing duality. And duality is diversity.

So by using diversity , we have to understand that we need to get fun to have diversion.

So remember , this is important for the spiritual people. Even if we are a spiritual thinking about up there , we are living here. And our goal in this reality is to work with the construction of a new reality in this reality.

So this is why our goal is to work with the balancing of polarity. And polarity in this world is lived by duality.

So we have to learn how to play with duality. And how do we play with duality through diversity? And how can we go through diversity getting fun? What is so?

So this is why we have to remember that the greatest master is the one that can see the reality with the eyes of a child. Playing with the reality.

So now my advice would be for all of you to have fun.

So how it is to get fun? I do n't know. You should know. I do n't know.

For some of you maybe is to play something , play something , table game. I do n't know. That would be a little bit boring too. But maybe I do n't know.

Someone is dancing for someone is laughing with friends or someone is , I do n't know. I think the problem would be if I have to explain you what it is fun , what it is to get fun.

So we are really bad. We are screwed it up.

So you have to figure out what is your way of getting fun.

## Daily Practice Elements

So just look into it. The information for today , the very good , the vibration is real. The statement for today is I am the legacy of the Divine Mother. The code for today is the color yellow.

The wavelength keeps increasing with more intensity. We tend to relate this glow with the sun , creating a direct relation with the solar plexus chara. Even though the truth is that the low frequency is only visible in our world , because the color blue of high frequency gets cancelled in the atmosphere. What makes the green color of the sun to be perceived as yellow.

So yes , the sun is green naturally. Well , you can see it better as green , but in the atmosphere , we start to perceive it as yellow. The light of the sun has all the colors , but the the most one is green. Yeah.

So we are breaking all the leaves of the world.

So yes , even if we see yellow , the sun is green. Once I read this , but the reason how you can tell the sun is green is because of the of the plants. You can read about it in internet , but the plants kind of absorb this right vibration of the frequency of the sun.

So that 's why they they assimilate this in green.

So I do n't know exactly the process. I read about it. I know about it , but I can not explain it exactly.

So you can read it all like it. Is it comfortable? Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

## Guided Meditation

Take a deep breath. And I remember , I so breathe that I am tasting this tiny piece of bread. Between a lot of people watching the Prophet. I recognize the nature that I have around.

Besieging the animals to people. I recognize the legacy of this messenger has brought.

Now lives also within me. The message is within me.

Now is your breath. You recognize that this is your moment. But this is my moment to bring this message. And observe and find with me a palm.

The text me to the English. And coming back home. And that village I find myself with a family. And this family , maybe it 's not the same family I have today.

Or maybe this , or maybe they are some different people. And I know it 's my family. And I take your moment to feel how it feels to be with them. And remember them.

I observe how I see it is circle within sharing food that they cooked. Because I tell them the legacy they have received. I tell them that I am. I tell them that as the mother earth is given us everything that we are now.

The father 's kinds. Is the one given us what I am. And both together create the I am. The earth creates me and the sky creates a me.

So together they start the celebration.

So I see how my family and the people from my village start to dance around the fire. Celebrating , laughing and enjoying having fun. As they celebrate. How do earth and heavens get to build?

And I laugh and smile. I say in joy , this celebration that connects the I and the I. I say see this celebration. I can recognize that I am giving this legacy to my family to the mine.

I see of the full mother connecting with the Holy Father. The legacy of entire creation and I will sound. I will. I will.

I will. I will. I will. I am.

I am the legacy of the divine mother. I am the legacy of the divine mother. And this divine mother. This divine matrix that I expand.

Generation. I see that legacy in me. I see. I see that I am the only one who has been in my heart.

Every mother in history lives within me. Every mother has given me life.

So I am all the families. I am the great family. Take it and pray. And bring all those consciousness all around your body.

Cherishing , stretching and joy. I am looking back here and now. Open your eyes. Thank you everybody for being here.

And for being part of this great family.
