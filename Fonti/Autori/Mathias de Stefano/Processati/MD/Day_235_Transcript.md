**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Solar Plexus
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Falling in Love as the Mechanism for Evolution
- **Vibration:** `Tï`
- **Statement:** `I Am Manifested Essence`
- **Code:** Libra - after identifying the good and the bad, that woman of the earth is positioned in the air to weigh the wheat and the chaff. And to do that, uses the scale. This way in the sky it was drawn among the stars, the scale that dispenses the correct parts among the just ones that worked and among those who had fewer possibilities. Libra is to deliver the good, to look for a more just law for that distribution, and divide between all parts. This way Libra sets the just, the division, and the delivery of what everybody needs.

## Overview

Today we are in Aswan, in the south of Egypt, beginning a five-day trip through the Nile with around 70 to 80 people. Today they visited Philae Island and the Temple of Isis, and then went to the Tree of Life in Aswan, which one year ago was where Matias received information about sowing the seeds of the 144.

Today's topic, received from one of the temple beings, is "to fall in love"—and why it's related to the solar plexus, not the heart.

---

## Why the Solar Plexus, Not the Heart?

### The Common Misconception

We usually say love is related to the heart chakra, to the heart. But it's not really like that, and Matias was very clear about this.

It's more related to the plexus, because the plexus is related to relationships and links with people.

### Physical, Emotional, Mental Aspects

We have spoken about this a few months ago, which moved everyone to start saying, "I love you from my pancreas."

The solar plexus is related:
- **Physically**: With the attachments we have with others or stuff
- **Emotionally**: About the bonds we have with people
- **Mentally**: About the beliefs that we project into the links with others

---

## The Etymology of "To Fall in Love"

### In Spanish: Enamorarse

What Matias said in Spanish, we don't have in English this concept, but he will explain it somehow.

The word "to fall in love" in Latin languages, in Spanish language, is "enamorarse," which is a conjunction of three words:
- **"En"**: Which is "to be inside"
- **"Amor"**: That means "without death" (so eternity)
- **"Se"**: That is a reflexive particle in language that means "to oneself"

So the word in Latin languages means to get inside the eternity of oneself. That's the translation of enamorarse.

### In English: To Fall in Love

To fall in love basically comes from "fall," which is to go inside, to the concept of getting inside something.

And "love"—remember that comes from "luef," that means the sexual energy actually. That's the origin of the word. This sphere means the desire, passion.

In English it's difficult to explain the meaning of that, but related to the solar plexus, to fall in love doesn't speak about the connection with the world but it extends how a person reflects that love on oneself. It's your own perspective, perception on what is love, basically.

---

## Love vs. To Fall in Love

### Love: The Eternal Energy

Let's try to understand first the meanings of love and to fall in love, which is to be in love, which is kind of a bit different.

Remember that love means the desire in the European languages. This desire is the basic energy usually related with the root chakra, which is the main engine of energy that moves the Kundalini of the world.

Love basically, for the word love, represents the Kundalini, the eternal energy that activates the body.

And this word of eternal energy that activates the being is related in Latin languages with "amor."

We're going to be able to understand this: "without death." Amor, without death, that is eternal.

### From Both Sides

From both sides we can understand that being is looking for an energy through the concept of love. But love is just a whole concept of what it is to be eternal.

It means that myself with my personality, I get into the idea of the eternity, but from my own point of view, my own perception of what is eternity.

### The Difference

The difference between one and the other would be that love is for anything—any thought, any emotion, action, anything that we can think about that connects us to the eternity.

And to fall in love puts some limitations according to our own point of view.

---

## Love Does Not Create Evolution

### Love Is Everything

Now what we should understand about this love and falling in love is that love actually is not an energy that is evolution. It doesn't help you in evolution.

Now Matias tries to understand this, to explain why. Because love is everything. Love is the main energy of eternity. So it exists in all things. It doesn't matter what happened to the things—it's actually all the time there.

Like kind of designing the idea of what it is, the unity, the essence of the things, the main structure of all the realities. So that's love.

### Love Cannot Be Measured

Love cannot be measured because eternity cannot be transformed—because it's constant transformation.

Basically, you cannot evolve through love. You can only live in the balance and harmony through love.

---

## To Fall in Love Is Evolution

### Movement and Change

So what's the difference with fall in love? Fall in love speaks about a movement, a change of point of view, because what before was outside now it will project within.

So it changed polarity. It changed the perception. It changed the idea of what you have perceived before from the outside. This means that it's constantly changing.

### The Action of Evolution

The action of falling in love is actually evolution because it goes from the outside to the inside and is moving constantly from one perception to another, from one point to another.

Actually, for humans, it's really difficult to really feel love, the real love. Maybe a few times we have perceived this energy that we call love.

### Constantly Falling in Love

Most of the time, every one of us as humans, we live falling in love constantly throughout our entire life. We are not in love with things or people—we are falling in love with things and people.

And why is this? Because we constantly project a link with others and we expect something from the others. We change our point of view once again, falling in love from the outside to the inside.

## Is Falling in Love an Illusion?

### The Question

Now we can say for the people that are looking for the real love, the great love of the universe, maybe you can think that to fall in love is like an illusion, so it's not good. We have to do something to not experience that and get confused because it's an illusion.

### But Isn't Everything an Illusion?

But now Matias's question would be: isn't everything an illusion?

Basically, falling in love is the way, the tool that we have, the engine that we have to keep the illusion being in order.

### The Mechanism for Evolution

The universe, basically, what is doing is to use the process of falling in love as a mechanism for moving forward, for evolution, for helping us transform in a better way, constantly in existence.

This means that the concept of falling in love is not something negative. The concept of falling in love is something that allows us to move forward.

---

## Fall in Love with Nothing

### The Message Received

One of the messages that Matias received through these years is that we have to fall in love with nothing.

And nothing, meaning the concept that originates the everything—so the void.

### Creating from the Void

And from that void, from this concept, is the point through where we can create our own reality. When we fall in love with that nothing, we are able to manifest new things. We are able to keep moving.

---

## The Solar System Metaphor

### Love: The Sun

Today Matias was explaining the way of how love expresses itself and how to fall in love expresses itself so we can understand it better according to how the planets move in the solar system.

We have the sun and the planets around. The planets and the sun are moving through gravity in the constants of time and space. They move around and the sun is in the center.

The gravity of the sun is pulling the planets, and they orbit around. Everything is in balance, in order. So that's love.

Love is basically this order, this beauty that is moving everything in a specific pattern that seems eternal.

### To Fall in Love: The Planets

So what is to fall in love? We can relate to fall in love with the movement of the planets that are doing like this when they spin around the sun or star.

This movement, when they go around the star, the sun, creates the perception of solstice and equinox because the axis of the planet is moving because of the gravity of the star, of the sun. This creates the seasons in the planet. It transforms everything in the surface of the planet.

### The Sun vs. The Planets

We can say now that the sun is fixed in the center of the solar system, and we have an axis of the sun that never moves and is attracting all the planets around, spinning and holding them constantly for eternity. This would explain love.

Love is not pulling stuff or willing to reach things. It's just there. It's in its own axis and doesn't expect anything from anyone.

But to fall in love is when these planets lose their axis, so they are out of their own center so they can reach something outside that they need for the inside.

### Creating Life and Seasons

In this constant movement, we are looking for stuff outside so we can complete ourselves. And this is what allows the planet to have life, to have seasons, to have all this evolution, to have geography—the movement of all the things on the surface of the planet, of the world.

---

## To Be Love vs. To Fall in Love

### To Be Love: The Sun

What it is to be love, what it is to express love, is to be like the sun—in the center, not moving anywhere, not willing to attract anything or to seek anything outside. Just shine in the center, sending love to everyone, not expecting anything from anyone.

### To Fall in Love: The Planet

And the second one, to fall in love, would be to lose the center, to go out from yourself in order to look for different ways in which the self can be expressed. And this is how we start to create the reality, to evolve and transform ourselves.

---

## Love Alone Cannot Create

### Love Is Already Everything

By itself, love can't do anything, can't create anything—it's impossible because it's already everything.

Love doesn't have the energy to move and to create all the wonders that we have in reality. The only way in which love can live all that is if it moves towards the outside, finding the inside. And that's what we call to fall in love.

### Practice Falling in Love

So it doesn't matter what—if it is a person, if it is a rock, if it is a dog, a cat, whatever—you have to fall in love. If you are just love, eternal love, that would be very boring, and Matias would leave it for after death.

In the meantime, practice: fall in love.

## Practice

### Preparation

Take a deep breath and softly start to caress and massage each part of your body from your feet until your head. Become aware of each part of it.

Become aware of your feet, your legs, genitals, hips, waist, back, chest, hands, arms, and shoulders. Go up through the throat, the face, the head.

### Opening the Solar Plexus

Take a deep breath. And softly go down with the tips of your fingers like opening the chest through the ribs, below the ribs, going to pressure and soft caresses on the stomach at the height of the diaphragm.

Take a deep breath and relax all the tensions of your body.

### Observing All You've Fallen in Love With

Take a deep breath, and in front of you, in the same position as you are now, seated, observe the image of the first person that you fell in love with in your life.

And observe how from this person, many others project around—all the people that you fell in love with, in a circle around you. Not only those you had a relationship with, but also the family, friends, lovers, all those that you admire. Everyone surrounded you.

### Receiving Their Hearts

And see, perceive how all their hearts project the energy and the light towards mine. And from my heart, they go down to my solar plexus, which shines.

Take a deep breath. Allow yourself to perceive all this love, to perceive this lens, this feeling of being in love with each one of these pulses.

Smile as you can see their look at you, their look of those people onto you. And the memory of every caress that they gave you, remember.

### Realizing the Projection

And then, realize that all these people you were falling in love with are just a projection of your own energy trying to create and reach itself to experience.

### Shining Like a Sun

Now decide to shine from your plexus bright like a sun, living in all directions, and rebound in all directions.

See, perceive how all those people you were falling in love with are shining back to you, giving you all the energy that you gave to them, reflected, coming back to your plexus.

### Sound the Vibration

Tï. I am the manifested essence. I am the manifested essence. I believe.

### Integration

Start to bring this consciousness all through your body by caressing stronger and stronger, coming back here and now, each one at your own time.

## Integration

### Fall in Love Today

Today, fall in love with something. Anything. A person, a tree, a moment, the void.

Not the eternal, unchanging love—but the movement, the projection, the reaching outside to find something within.

This is how you evolve.

### Recognize Projections

Notice that everyone you've ever fallen in love with is you—your own energy, projecting outward, trying to experience itself.

This doesn't diminish the love. It reveals the truth: you are loving yourself through them.

### Be the Sun Sometimes

And also practice being love—the sun, fixed in the center, shining on everyone, expecting nothing. This is the balance.

But remember: without falling in love (the planets moving, creating seasons), there is no life, no evolution, no creation.

## Q&A

### Q: If love doesn't create evolution, what's the point of it?

Love is the foundation, the eternal structure, the axis. It's the sun that everything orbits around. But the movement, the evolution, the creation comes from falling in love—from losing your center to reach outside and find yourself again.

### Q: Is falling in love just an illusion then?

Everything is an illusion. But falling in love is the mechanism that keeps the illusion in order, that allows evolution and transformation. It's not a lesser state—it's the engine of creation.

### Q: Why is falling in love related to the solar plexus?

Because the solar plexus governs relationships, bonds, attachments, and the beliefs we project onto others. Falling in love is about your perception, your projection—not the eternal truth of the heart.

### Q: What does it mean to fall in love with nothing (the void)?

The void is the origin of everything. When you fall in love with nothing, you're reaching into the source, the potential, the place where all creation begins. From there, you can manifest anything.

### Q: If everyone I've fallen in love with is just my projection, is the relationship real?

The relationship is real, but it's also a mirror. You're experiencing yourself through them. This doesn't make it less sacred—it makes it more so, because you're recognizing the divine play.

### Q: How do I balance being love (the sun) and falling in love (the planets)?

Be the sun in your core—stable, shining, expecting nothing. And fall in love with life—move, change, project, reach, create. Both are necessary. Both are sacred.

### Q: Can I just stay in eternal love and not fall in love?

You can try, but Matias says it would be very boring. And more importantly, without the movement of falling in love, there's no evolution, no seasons, no life. Eternal love is for after death. For now, fall in love.
