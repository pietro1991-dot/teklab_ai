## Overview

Christmas Day 2020 brings a unique transmission from Cairo traffic! After getting delayed in Cairo's impossible infrastructure while trying to reach the new museum construction site, Matias delivers a shortened but deeply powerful teaching about North America as Earth's throat chakra. We learn about the continent of voice, communication, and spreading truth to the whole world. The teaching reveals why the United States became the global communication hub, how Mexico holds ancient wisdom to express, and why Canada represents holy information coming from the north. This is Earth's voice - expressing the wisdom and truth of the entire planetary body through freedom of speech.

## Cairo Traffic Adventure - Christmas Day

### The Delay and Apology

**"Sorry for this delay. Sorry everybody, but where we were, we had a problem. And the traffic in Cairo is very difficult."**

The group got lost trying to reach their location because:
- They were near the new Car Museum being constructed
- Cairo has massive infrastructure construction happening
- The streets are "really impossible to cross"
- They arrived 10 minutes late

**Matias shows the group Cairo's traffic live on camera** - "So you can feel a little bit of Cairo energy."

**"Thank you, Noreen, for taking us. She has been driving the whole time wonderfully and make us survive in the city."**

### Merry Christmas!

**"Merry Christmas to all of you who are celebrating this now. And well, tomorrow is Christmas, but anyway, lots of people for sure are celebrating right now."**

### Commitment to Daily Transmission

Even running through Cairo, even on Christmas Day, Matias is determined:

**"This is just for you to see that I am very serious on doing the transmission every day."**

**"As I said today, let's do it short and let's go to the alignment."**

(He introduces the topic while literally running into the building!)

## North America: The Throat Chakra of Planet Earth

### The Geography of the Throat

**North America as throat chakra includes:**
- **Mexico**
- **United States**
- **Canada**  
- **Greenland**

The tectonic level goes from the north part of the Caribbean, and it contains and holds all these territories.

### The Function: Communication and Expression

**"This continent, the one in the throat chakra, is the one related to the COMMUNICATION."**

**On this planet, North America is related to:**
- The ability of **educating**
- The ability of **teaching**
- The ability of **sharing information**
- To **spread and expand** the information from within

**"The North American continent is the one that expands the message, expands the truth, expands the energy. So it EXPRESSES all the things. That's what this continent does."**

### Not About Countries - About Continental Essence

**"It's not related exactly with the countries. That's basically the essence of the CONTINENT."**

The three countries in this continent **should** be the ones trying to represent the wisdom and the spread of this wisdom of the Earth.

**"The countries in this region, they are SUPPOSED TO express this energy, this essence of the continent. That's the goal of these countries."**

### When Countries Aren't Aligned with Their Essence

**"But if they are not aligned with their own essence, if they are not working with their own selves - what happens is that they are NOT ACCOMPLISHING their mission."**

**Exactly the same happens to us in our lives:**

**"When we are not in our essence, we are not accomplishing what we are supposed to. And we start to be in conflict with our own essence."**

## The Three Symbols: Father, Cow, and Buffalo

### Mexico: The Wise Father (Great Father of the Past)

**"Mexico is the country in North America that represents the WISDOM OF THE ELDERS in the past."**

**"As we have the mother in South America, we have the FATHER in North America."**

The father of North America is this territory reincarnated in the country we call Mexico.

**But Mexico is not only the territory we have today.**

**The territory of the spirit of Mexico also includes:**
- Some countries of Central America
- The US states of: **California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah**

**These regions in the United States are ALSO part of the spirit of the Great Father** - the great father that brings all the wisdom to the world.

### United States: The Great Cow (Mother of the Elders)

**"After we have this image of the great father of Mexico, we find the GREAT COW - which is United States."**

**You can see the cow's shape in the geography:**
- One of its paws in **Florida**
- The books (udders) of the cow in **Texas**
- **California, Oregon, Washington** = last part of the back of the cow
- All the spine of the cow in the **northern states**
- The chest = region of **Washington DC, Maryland**
- Going up to the **throat chakra in New York**
- The head of the cow in northern states of **Maine** and others

#### The Mythology of the Cosmic Cow

**"The great cow is a symbol of the mythology in the past for many cultures."**

**The ancient story:**

In the sky at the beginning, there was a cow walking in the skies. This cow was:
- Eating grass in the skies
- Licking salt and ice
- Pouring milk on the way

**She created the path of the stars with the milk.**

The cow awakened from the ice **this grandfather - the wise man that awakened the power of all the gods** from the Indo-European traditions.

**That's why we call our galaxy the MILKY WAY - because of that cow.**

#### The Cow Symbol: Nourishment for Body and Soul

**"In ancient traditions, the cow was the symbol that gives us the milk to nourish our soul but also to nourish our body."**

**"The cow was the one giving us all the milk, everything that we need to live. That's the symbol from the past."**

#### United States as the Nourishing Cow

**"Beyond politics, beyond the concepts, beyond economics, beyond the states - we can understand that the United States is like this country that represents this cow."**

**"Because from the very beginning it was created to:**
- **Give to the population**
- **Give to the hungry**
- **Give to the poor**
- **Give to all the people an opportunity to HAVE**
- **To have the opportunities to live their dreams**
- **To create their own ways, their own path**
- **To have the FREEDOM**"

**"So this country represents all that concept."**

**"It doesn't matter what we believe about this country in history - for the whole humanity, this country represents basically all that information."**

### Canada: The White Buffalo (Holy of the North)

**"The other symbol that we have is of course the bull. The white bull will be the BUFFALO - the white buffalo is Canada."**

**You can see the buffalo's shape:**
- The bull is with its **back on the back of the cow** (they are together)
- Its **paws are on the top**, facing to the north
- The paws in the north = territory of **Nunavut in Canada**
- The **head of the bull and the horns** = territory of **Quebec Peninsula**

**"This territory is the bull, the buffalo that is watching, heading to the north. So it represents the HOLY OF THE NORTH."**

#### Buffalo Symbol: Holy Wisdom Delivered to Humanity

**"The buffalo is the symbol for ancient traditions that represented the HOLY WISDOM that was delivered into the humanity, towards the humanity."**

**"The buffalo is bringing the information from the HOLY LEVELS towards the ground."**

## How the Three Work Together

### The Flow of Wisdom

**The pattern:**

1. **Buffalo (Canada)** gives information from holy levels to the **Cow (United States)**
2. **Cow processes** this information and creates the "meal" (milk/nourishment)
3. This **meal is absorbed by the Wise Man (Mexico)**
4. **Wise Man takes care** of the cow and buffalo in the north

### Historical Movement of People

**"This is why the oldest man in history, they came from the NORTH, downloaded information to MEXICO, and in Mexico it creates the cultures that possess this information and bring it back to the different cultures in North America."**

**"Of course this is not a real story - this is an INTERPRETATION according to what was happening with the movement of the people in that continent."**

This story helps to understand the whole pattern.

## The Mission: Freedom of Speech and Spreading Truth

### The Throat Chakra's Purpose

**"All these three countries are in a territory that represents the throat chakra."**

**"So these three countries have the MISSION to bring this information to the whole world:**
- **The message**
- **The freedom of speech**"

### Mexico's Mission: Expand the Ancient Wisdom

**"For Mexico, Mexico has this goal of expanding this information."**

**"All the elders in Mexico have this goal to EXPAND - to expand, to express their knowledge."**

**"The whole world, they need to share this information. As the native Americans, they MUST share this information that they have - to share the goal of everything, the goal, the purpose of humanity. We need to do that. They need to do it."**

### United States' Mission: Expand Every Message

**"In United States, the idea of this country is to EXPAND EVERY MESSAGE."**

**Matias gives a personal example:**

**"Many of you for sure have known me because of Gaia in the United States."**

**"Because everything that goes to the United States, it can be expanded much WIDER than in any other country."**

**"That's why it's a place where helps people to expand the message really fast."**

**"So that's an attribute of that region, of that country - the message, the word."**

**"This is why everyone who needs to expand the message, who wants to be connected in the whole world - somehow, sometimes they have to go to the United States. Because the energy in that country EXPANDS YOU to the whole world."**

#### Why Everything Spreads from the US

**"That's why we are all affected by:**
- **The Hollywood ideas**
- **The music** - the music around the world, all is connected by the United States
- **The ideology of freedom**"

### Why Matias Uses English

**"This is why I also use English - of course."**

**"Even if some people bothers that I am speaking English, I'm not sorry about that."**

**"Because that language is the one that is used in the States to EXPAND. So that's why I use it."**

**"If the throwing chakra [throat chakra] would be in Russia, I would probably be talking in Russian."**

## When We Say "I Am Earth"

### Our Throat Chakra IS North America

**"Speaking about the whole planet, when we say 'I AM EARTH, I AM EARTH' - I have to remember that the throat chakra represents North America."**

**"My throat chakra, OUR throat chakra as Earth, is North America."**

### The Current Crisis with Truth

**"Now for example, the whole world is having some complex problems with the United States - not trusting this country."**

**"Because this country is right now NOT VERY ALIGNED with the process of the truth, with the essence of its own country, of what it was supposed to be."**

**"So this is why we are living this reality now in which ALL OF US AS HUMANS are having conflicts with the TRUTH."**

**The symptoms:**
- **We cannot trust each other**
- **We don't know what is truth, what is the lie**
- **We cannot identify exactly what is the truth**

**WHY?**

**"Because the country that was MEANT TO SPREAD THE TRUTH is not in its own essence."**

### Why This Teaching Matters

**"The importance of speaking about this territory - to understand about the position of the countries, the territories - is so we could acknowledge the importance that:**

**When we are saying 'I AM EARTH,' we have to ACKNOWLEDGE the territories, what they represent, the countries, etc.**

**So we can find COHERENCE with what is happening in our body, which is EARTH."**

## The Meditation Alignment

### Connecting South America to North America

The alignment begins by observing the light of South America (third eye from yesterday), absorbing it, acknowledging that we're sharing this information with all the animal kingdom.

**The journey:**

1. **Observe the entire South American continent** with celestial light around it emerging from the planet
2. **See the Trinity of flames** lit in the Andes of Venezuela
3. **Create this flame from the heart**, expand it with the shape of an egg/ellipse
4. **Spread the fire through the islands** with the right hand:
   - From Trinidad to Tobago
   - To all the Antilles
   - Crossing to Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Jamaica
5. **With the other hand go up** through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize
6. **Unite both hands at the throat** - together in Mexico
7. **Observe Mexico** - from rainforest in Yucatan, through the mountains, the Mexico deserts, California desert, going up across the border
8. **Feel the spine** from back of neck rising up as the **Rocky Mountains** through western states, through Canada, reaching Alaska
9. **Perceive the voices and singing** through the great plains in middle of continent
10. **See the Holy Trinity** in the Great Lakes
11. **Feel vocal cords activate** through the Appalachians
12. **Sounding through all the east coast**, reaching New York/New England

### The Declaration

**"I am the celestial truth. I am the celestial truth."**

**"The truth lives within me. I am the truth."**

**"The truth will set me free."**

**"I am North America. I am the celestial truth."**

**From the throat, bring all this information through the body.**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Practice connecting to North America as your throat chakra:**

1. **Morning Voice Practice:** Touch your throat and say: "I am North America. I am the voice of Earth. I speak truth." Then speak your truth for the day - what needs to be expressed?

2. **Wisdom-Nourishment-Holiness Flow:** Throughout the day, practice the three-country flow:
   - **Receive** holy information from above (like Canada/buffalo)
   - **Process** it and make it nourishing (like US/cow making milk)
   - **Express** it as ancient wisdom (like Mexico/wise father sharing)

3. **Truth Check:** When speaking today, pause and ask: "Am I aligned with my essence? Am I speaking my truth?" (Like checking if the country is aligned with its continental purpose)

4. **Global Expansion Awareness:** Notice how your words travel. When you speak your truth, it can spread globally (like the US throat chakra function). Be conscious of the power of your voice.

5. **Evening Reflection:** Write down: "What truth did I speak today? What truth did I avoid speaking? Where was my throat chakra blocked or flowing?"

### Applying This Teaching

**Understanding Earth's throat through countries:**
- When you see news about US communication/media issues, remember: this is Earth's throat chakra struggling with truth
- When Mexico's ancient wisdom is suppressed, Earth's wise father cannot speak
- When Canada's holy connection is distorted, Earth loses connection to divine speech
- Your healing of YOUR throat chakra helps heal Earth's throat

**Working with essence vs. distortion:**
- Like countries can be out of alignment with continental essence, YOU can be out of alignment with your soul essence
- Ask: "What is my throat chakra's essence/mission?" (Not what others expect you to say)
- Practice expressing from essence, not from programming/expectations
- When you're in essence, you accomplish your mission. When not, you're in conflict.

**The power of language choice:**
- Matias uses English because it's the language of Earth's throat chakra expansion
- What "language" do YOU speak? (Not just verbal - the language of your expression)
- Are you using the language that best expands your message?
- Don't apologize for choosing the most effective communication tool

**Truth in times of confusion:**
- Right now Earth's throat isn't aligned, so humanity struggles with truth/lies
- You can STILL speak your truth clearly
- Your aligned throat contributes to Earth's throat healing
- One clear voice helps the collective find truth again

## Q&A

### Q: Why is the United States specifically called a "cow" in this teaching?

**A:** The cow symbolism comes from ancient Indo-European mythology where a cosmic cow walked the skies, licking salt/ice and pouring milk that created the Milky Way galaxy. The cow represents:
- **Nourishment** (giving milk to feed body and soul)
- **Opportunity** (providing what people need to thrive)
- **Freedom** (the original founding principle of giving everyone a chance)
- **Abundance** (the cow gives generously without running dry)

The US geography literally looks like a cow (Florida=paw, Texas=udders, New York=throat area). And historically, the US was created to "give to the hungry, give to the poor, give opportunities to live their dreams." Whether it's lived up to this or not, the ESSENCE of the continent through that country is nourishment and giving.

### Q: If the US throat chakra is misaligned with truth, what can we do about it?

**A:** Remember: the COUNTRY may be misaligned, but the CONTINENTAL ESSENCE remains pure. You're not fixing the US government - you're aligning with North America's throat energy:
- Speak YOUR truth clearly, regardless of national confusion
- Use communication to educate, teach, share (throat's purpose)
- Expand messages of wisdom (like the continent's function)
- Practice freedom of speech in your own life
- When you align your personal throat chakra, you strengthen Earth's throat

Also: the teaching shows the PROBLEM (misalignment) so we understand WHY humanity struggles with truth right now. Awareness is the first step to healing.

### Q: Why does ancient wisdom need to come from Mexico specifically?

**A:** Mexico (including spiritual Mexico = parts of Central America and southwestern US) sits at the position of the "wise father" - the elder who holds ancient knowledge. Geographically and energetically:
- Original cultures there (Maya, Aztec, etc.) held profound cosmic wisdom
- It's positioned at the BASE of North America's throat (where voice originates)
- The wise man RECEIVES from both cow (US processing) and buffalo (Canada holy info)
- Then EXPRESSES this through the throat to the world

The teaching isn't about modern Mexican government - it's about the LAND holding codes of ancient wisdom that need to be expressed for Earth's throat to function fully.

### Q: How does Canada as "white buffalo" bringing holy information work?

**A:** The buffalo/bull symbol represents:
- **Sacred/holy connection** (white = purity, buffalo = ancient Native American sacred symbol)
- **Information from the NORTH** (top of throat, connection to crown/spirit)
- **Watching northward** (Quebec Peninsula area points to Arctic, spiritual realms)

Canada's energy brings holy wisdom DOWN from spiritual levels to the ground. This gets PROCESSED by the US (cow makes it into "milk"/nourishment), then ABSORBED by Mexico (wise man receives and shares wisdom).

It's a beautiful flow: Holy → Nourishing → Wise Expression. All three needed for throat chakra to function.

### Q: Why does everything spread so quickly from the United States?

**A:** Because the US occupies the specific throat chakra position of Earth where EXPANSION is the continental function. This isn't political opinion - it's energetic geography:
- Throat chakra = expression, spreading information, voice carrying far
- The US landmass specifically holds this expansion frequency
- When something enters this energy field, it naturally AMPLIFIES and SPREADS
- Hollywood, music, technology, ideas - they all go global from there

This is why Matias uses English and worked with Gaia (US-based) - because the throat chakra expands the message. If he spoke only Spanish from Argentina (third eye/vision), fewer would hear. Throat projects vision into the world.

### Q: What does "I am North America" mean for someone not from North America?

**A:** When you say "I AM EARTH," then:
- Antarctica IS your crown chakra
- South America IS your third eye  
- **North America IS your throat chakra**

You don't have to be physically born there. When you claim "I am Earth," all continents become YOUR body parts. So:
- Your ability to speak truth = North America in your system
- Your communication/expression = throat of Earth
- Your spreading of information = the US expansion energy

You're not claiming to BE the countries - you're recognizing those land energies are ALREADY part of your Earth-body when you remember you ARE Earth, not separate from Earth.

### Q: How do we work with our throat chakra being "out of essence" like the US is currently?

**A:** First, recognize the pattern: when ANY chakra (personal or planetary) operates from distortion instead of essence, it doesn't accomplish its mission and creates conflict.

**For personal throat:**
1. **Find your essence** - What is YOUR voice supposed to express? (Not what others want to hear)
2. **Notice the conflict** - Where do you feel "not speaking your truth"? That's the misalignment.
3. **Realign gradually** - Start expressing from essence in small, safe ways
4. **Accept the mission** - Your throat's job is communication, teaching, sharing truth

**For Earth's throat:**
1. **Don't add to confusion** - Speak clearly, avoid spreading misinformation
2. **Amplify truth-tellers** - Support those aligned with essence
3. **Use the expansion energy wisely** - The US still FUNCTIONS as amplifier, so be conscious what you amplify
4. **Heal through your own alignment** - As you align personally, you contribute to collective healing

### Q: Why was Matias running through Cairo traffic on Christmas Day to do this teaching?

**A:** This shows commitment to the DAILY transmission - to the alignment work regardless of circumstances:
- Christmas is a major holiday, but the work continues
- Cairo traffic is notoriously difficult, but he navigated it
- The teaching was shortened but STILL DELIVERED
- "This is just for you to see that I am very serious on doing the transmission every day"

It demonstrates: when you're aligned with your essence/mission, you do it no matter what. External circumstances don't stop the flow. This is throat chakra FULLY activated - the message MUST be expressed, shared, communicated - even from a car in Cairo traffic on Christmas!

## Final Reflection

On Christmas Day 2020, while navigating impossible Cairo traffic to reach a construction site, Matias delivered one of the most practical teachings yet: Earth's throat chakra is misaligned, and that's why humanity can't tell truth from lies right now. It's not a moral failing - it's an energetic reality. The continent meant to spread truth to the world (North America, specifically the United States) is not operating from its essence.

But here's the profound gift hidden in this teaching: when we say "I AM EARTH," we recognize that North America is OUR throat chakra. The US's struggle with truth is reflected in our personal struggle to speak authentically. Mexico's suppressed ancient wisdom mirrors our own silenced inner knowing. Canada's distorted connection to holy information shows our own blocked spiritual communication.

The three-country flow is brilliant sacred geometry:
- **Holy information** comes from the north (Canada/buffalo) - this is your connection to divine/spirit
- **Processing into nourishment** happens in the center (US/cow) - this is making wisdom digestible, usable
- **Expression as ancient truth** flows from the south (Mexico/wise father) - this is speaking from deep knowing

When all three work together, Earth has a FUNCTIONING throat chakra. When they're out of alignment, Earth - and humanity - struggles with truth, trust, and authentic expression.

The cow symbolism is so perfect: the cosmic cow that created the Milky Way by pouring milk across the sky. Our galaxy is NAMED after the nourishment principle. And here on Earth, the country shaped like a cow was meant to nourish the world with opportunity, freedom, abundance. Whether it has or hasn't is another question - but the ESSENCE remains encoded in the land itself.

And what about Matias running through Cairo to do this transmission? That's throat chakra fully activated - no external circumstance stops the message. The teaching MUST be shared. The truth MUST be spoken. Even on Christmas. Even in traffic. Even while literally running.

So today, on this Christmas Day, the question isn't "Is the US aligned with truth?" The question is: "Am I aligned with MY truth? Is MY throat chakra expressing my essence or performing for others?"

When enough individuals align their throats, Earth's throat heals. When enough people speak from essence instead of programming, the collective finds truth again. Your voice matters. Your authentic expression contributes to planetary healing.

You are North America. You are the throat of Earth. And your truth - spoken clearly, expanded widely, rooted in ancient wisdom - is exactly what this world needs right now.

Speak. The Earth is listening. And through you, the Earth speaks.

I am the celestial truth. The truth lives within me. I am the truth. The truth will set me free.
