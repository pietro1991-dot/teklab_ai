## Overview

Today we arrive at the solar plexus chakra of the Mental Week of Aries. The topic is the question **Who?**

This is perhaps the most complex question we've explored this week because it takes us to the nature of **subject versus object**, to the very foundation of how we perceive reality.

While the previous questions dealt with objects, causes, effects, and qualities, "Who?" asks about **the subject**—the one perceiving, the one interpreting, the one creating meaning.

Let's explore this profound question.

---

## Etymology: Object vs. Subject

### What = Object (Quo)

Remember, the question **"What?"** comes from **quo** in European language, meaning **a thing**, an **object**.

**Quo** is the root of:
- What
- Which
- Quality

All these words relate to **objects**—things we can point to.

### Who = Subject (Quom)

The question **"Who?"** comes from **quom** (or **quem**), meaning **someone**, a **subject**.

This is the root of words like:
- Who
- Whom

### The Fundamental Difference

- **What** asks about the **object**
- **Who** asks about the **subject**—the one observing, interpreting, or being

---

## Understanding Object vs. Subject

### Example: Five Dots

Imagine I draw **five dots** on a paper.

If I ask: **"What are these?"**
You answer: "Five dots."

That's the **objective** reality—the physical things on the paper.

### The Subjective Layer

But if you **connect** those five dots, you might see: **a pentagon, a pentagram, a star**.

Now, if I ask: **"What is this?"**
You might answer: "A pentagram."

But the pentagram **doesn't objectively exist**. The five dots exist.

The pentagram is the **subject**—the concept, the meaning, the interpretation.

### What vs. Who in This Example

- **What are they?** Five dots (object)
- **Who are they?** A pentagram, a symbol, a meaning (subject)

The "who" creates a **mental construct** from the objective reality.

---

## We Are Both Object and Subject

### The Objective You

From the **objective** perspective, you are:
- Particles
- Atoms
- Molecules
- Cells
- Organs
- A body

This is **what** you are.

### The Subjective You

From the **subjective** perspective, you are:
- A person
- A soul
- A spirit
- Beliefs
- Emotions
- Identity

This is **who** you are.

### The Question "Who?" Creates the Subject

When we ask **"Who are you?"** we're asking about the **mental construct**, the interpretation, the meaning you've created from the particles.

The answer to "Who am I?" is always **subjective**—always an interpretation.

---

## The Brain Connects the Dots

### We Never See Reality As It Is

Your **brain** is designed to **connect the dots**.

You never see particles, atoms, or molecules directly.

You see **patterns, shapes, meanings**—the things your brain constructs.

### The Five Senses Create Interpretation

Your five senses take in data, and your **brain interprets** that data.

- You don't see light waves; you see **colors**
- You don't hear vibrations; you hear **sounds**
- You don't touch molecules; you feel **textures**

Everything you experience is already **interpreted**.

### Example: Seven Dots

Imagine seven dots arranged in a particular way.

Depending on how you connect them, you might see:
- A **cube**
- A **flower**
- A **dog**
- A **snake**

All of these are **subjective interpretations** of the same seven objective dots.

### This Is Called Pareidolia

**Pareidolia** is when the brain sees familiar patterns (like faces in clouds).

But actually, **all perception** is pareidolia.

Your brain is always **closing the gaps**, creating meaning from fragments.

---

## We Are Holograms

### What Is a Hologram?

A **hologram** is an image that appears three-dimensional but is created by **light interference patterns**.

It's not solid. It's the **conjunction of waves, particles, and dimensions**.

### You Are a Hologram

In the same way, **you** are not a solid, fixed thing.

You are the **conjunction** of:
- Particles (matter)
- Waves (energy)
- Dimensions (time, space, consciousness)

### The Subjective Self

The "you" that you think you are—your personality, identity, beliefs—is the **hologram**.

It's the **interpretation** of all these waves and particles.

It's not "fake," but it's also not the **only** reality.

---

## The Subjective Nature of "Who"

### Who You Are Is Mental

When someone asks **"Who are you?"** they're asking about your **subjective identity**.

- Your name
- Your personality
- Your beliefs
- Your story

All of these are **mental constructs**—interpretations of objective reality.

### Different Perspectives, Different "Whos"

From different perspectives, the same **objective** energy can be interpreted as different **subjects**:

- A master
- An angel
- A demon
- A teacher
- A friend
- An enemy

The energy itself is **neutral** (object).

The interpretation is **subjective** (who).

---

## Michael: "Who Like God?"

### The Meaning of Michael

The name **Michael** (in Hebrew: **Mi-ka-el**) means: **"Who is like God?"**

It's a question.

### Michael Asks: Who?

The Archangel Michael represents the force that asks: **"Who am I in relation to the Creator?"**

This question creates **ego**, creates **individuality**, creates **separation**.

Michael is the one who says: "I am not the whole. I am **a part**. Who am I?"

### Gravity and Ego

This is the same force as **gravity**.

Gravity creates individuality—it pulls things into separate forms.

Michael's question **manifests ego**—the individual self.

---

## The Opposite: "Who Like the Creator?"

### Satan and Shaman: The Same Word

In many ancient languages, the word for the **opposite force** (often translated as "Satan") is the same as the word **shaman**.

Both mean: **the one who asks the opposite question**.

### The Opposite Question

Instead of asking: **"Who am I?"** (Michael, ego, individuality)

The opposite asks: **"Who is the Creator?"** (wholeness, unity, the All)

### Two Paths

- **Michael's path**: Who am I? (descending into individuality, manifestation, ego)
- **Opposite path**: Who is the whole? (ascending into unity, spirit, oneness)

Both are necessary.

You need **gravity** (ego) to have form.

You need **anti-gravity** (spirit) to remember wholeness.

---

## The Cube, Metatron, and the Force

### The Cube of Individuality

The cube (or **hexahedron**) is the symbol of **gravity**, of **individuation**.

It's the shape that represents **"Who am I?"**

In sacred geometry, this is associated with **Metatron's Cube**—the pattern that creates individuality.

### The Jedi and the Shady

In *Star Wars*, the **Jedi** represent the light side of the Force (asking "Who is the whole?").

The **Sith** (or "shady" side) represent the dark side (asking "Who am I?").

### The Force Itself

The **Force** is the objective reality—the energy.

The Jedi and Sith are **subjective interpretations** of that same Force.

Neither is the Force itself. Both are **who** the Force becomes through different perspectives.

---

## The Practice: Who Am I Asking "Who?"

### The Task for Today

Today, write questions that begin with **"Who?"**

Examples:
- Who am I?
- Who do I think I am?
- Who am I becoming?
- Who am I in this relationship?
- Who is the person I see in the mirror?
- Who is asking these questions?

### The Meta-Question

The key is to also ask: **Who is the one asking "Who?"**

When you ask "Who am I?" there is an "I" asking about an "I."

Which one is real?

### No Answers, Just Questions

Like all this week, don't answer the questions.

Just **notice** that "who" is always subjective, always changing, always an interpretation.

Sound: **Gï**

**I am the vision of self. I am the vision of self. I am the vision of self.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Stretching and yawning, each one came back here and now at your own time.

## Key Insights

- "Who?" is a **subjective question**—it asks about the one perceiving, not the object perceived.
- **What** (quo) asks about objects; **Who** (quom) asks about subjects.
- The five dots example: objective = dots, subjective = pentagram meaning.
- You are both object (particles, atoms, body) and subject (person, soul, identity).
- The brain always **connects the dots**—you never see reality as it is.
- All perception is interpretation (pareidolia on a grand scale).
- We are **holograms**—conjunctions of particles, waves, and dimensions.
- **Michael** ("Who like God?") asks the question that creates ego and individuality.
- The opposite asks "Who is the Creator?"—the question that returns to wholeness.
- Both are necessary: gravity (individuality) and anti-gravity (unity).

## Integration

### Daily Awareness: Notice the Subject

Today, when you interact with someone, notice:

You're not seeing the **object** (the particles that make up their body).

You're seeing the **subject** (your interpretation of who they are).

Ask: "What if my interpretation isn't the only truth?"

### The Observer and the Observed

When you think "I am sad" or "I am angry," ask:

**Who is the "I" that is observing the sadness or anger?**

If you can observe your emotion, then you are not **only** that emotion. You're also the observer.

### Connecting the Dots

Look at something in your environment.

Then ask: "What am I actually seeing—the object, or my brain's interpretation of it?"

Recognize that your entire experience is your brain **connecting dots** and creating meaning.

## Week Context

Mental Week of Aries—Questions that Ignite Consciousness:

- Day 1 (Crown): What? (object)
- Day 2 (Third Eye): Why? (cause/origin)
- Day 3 (Throat): What for? (effect/purpose)
- Day 4 (Heart): Which? (quality/choice)
- Day 5 (Solar Plexus): Who? (subject/identity)
- Continuing through Day 10...

We've moved from the objective (what, why, what for, which) to the subjective (who). Tomorrow, we continue building the architecture of consciousness.

## Q&A

### Q: If "who I am" is subjective, does that mean my identity isn't real?

It means your identity is **real as a mental construct**, just like the pentagram is real as a concept. But it's not the **only** reality. You're also particles, energy, the observer, and the whole.

### Q: How can I function if I don't believe in "who I am"?

You don't have to **disbelieve** your identity. Just recognize it's **one layer** of reality, not the whole truth. You can play the role while knowing it's a role.

### Q: What does this have to do with Michael and Satan?

Michael's question ("Who am I?") creates individuality—necessary for manifestation. The opposite question ("Who is the whole?") returns to unity—necessary for remembering the source. You need both to be complete.

### Q: Is the brain "wrong" for interpreting reality?

No. Interpretation is its job. The brain creates meaning so you can navigate the world. The point isn't to stop interpreting—it's to **know you're interpreting**.

### Q: How is this different from simulation theory?

This isn't about whether reality is "fake." It's about recognizing that **your experience** of reality is always filtered through perception, interpretation, and mental constructs. The particles are real. Your interpretation is also real. Both are true.

### Q: What's the practical value of knowing I'm a hologram?

When you see yourself as a **fixed subject**, you suffer when that identity is threatened. When you see yourself as a **hologram** (conjunction of particles and perspectives), you can transform without losing yourself.

### Q: Is the Force in Star Wars a good metaphor for this?

Yes. The Force is the **objective reality** (energy, what is). The Jedi and Sith are **subjective interpretations** (who experiences it). The Force doesn't care which side you're on—it just is.
