## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So let 's begin with our day , which I believe is very intense.

Today 's post for me was like , wow , if it was right in it , it was intense.

So I do n't know maybe for some of you , it 's like , oh yes , normal , but for me it was shocking.

So I do n't know.

So I will try to explain the information I post for today , but I do n't know if I 'm going to be able to do that. I 'm going to be able to do it properly.

## Q&A

So if you want to know more about it , I recommend you to read the post. Just in case. When I knew that this week would be all about questions , I thought that what I 'm going to write about the questions.

So I do n't have much in my head , but it is really being intense.

So let 's begin by the easy. What is the meaning of who and where it comes from? Topic for today , the question is who. And from where it comes , who exactly has all the other questions from in the European language , who.

But who means object , is the object , the matter of the question , who.

So who transforms itself into a object , the subject and for that we have to add one M.

So it 's cool , which in English you have home.

So when we speak , cool , is about the object , the thing , like this here , this is an object , a physical thing that you can perceive by the five senses. But when I transform an object into a subject , this means that , suddenly , I give a meaning to this. Because I give a soul to this. I create the idea of a soul.

So I also give a person I to this.

Remember that the question , what? The question , what? Is the object and the question , who is the subject? The difference in this too is that the object describes the physical aspect of something.

And the subject is described in the invisible act of a thing. But both of them are speaking about the same. Yeah.

So now , let 's talk about this here , according to an object and according to a subject.

So from the point of view of an object , this here is a dot. From the point of view of the subject , this is unity.

So a dot can be something that you can refer to in a physical way. The subject , unity is not. You can not relate it to exactly a physical , is a concept. From the point of view of an object , we have five dots.

Okay? Five dots. If I connect the dots , I have the star. But all this is just the object because I 'm just receiving five dots and the shape of a star.

Where is the subject?

So where is the subject here? The subject is when I connect all of this in this star and we call it pentagram. Related to the fifth five elements , which granted , how can we object is the five dots that creates the star. The subject is the information behind the body in this object.

Okay? What do I have here?

So here , where we have five dots , again , one , two , three , four , five. What are they? Tiny parts. We call that party calls.

The Latin , tiny , rule , parts. Tiny parts. And now what happened if I do this? It becomes an atom.

Okay? A conjunction of atoms , what it forms. Tiny atoms , what creates a molecule. Molecule is a tiny big part.

Molecule is a tiny big part. Then I sometimes a little bit much complex. Which is organs.

Now , the object and the subject.

So the object , what is the object? The object is a conjunction of atoms that makes molecules that shape organs. Yes? And what 's object?

The subject is the person. The soul , the spirit , the beliefs , the emotions.

So what we have here in the object of this being is all perceivable by the physical.

Okay? Is an objective , is something that you can measure by the five sentences. And the subject are untouchable things. And the subject is something that you can not measure that are impossible to know.

The person , the soul , the spirit , the beliefs , the emotions. This one from here is called what? And this one from here is called who? Let 's go to the next step.

Do you remember everything that we have learned about the five sentences? Five sentences. Eyes , smell , eyes , nose , ears , mouth , hands.

So the side , smell , taste , hearing and touch.

So now remember that each one of the sentences are receiving data from the outside , sending this information to the brain. And the brain interprets this pulses.

Remember that everything that we perceive from the outside is just a portion of the understanding of the brain. That 's it.

Okay?

So this is a perfect system of interpretation. What do you see here? There are many possible answers of what you see here. Let 's say some of them.

Seven dogs.

So here we can see many different things in this shape.

So here we can see a dog 's , a cube , an exahedron. It 's called flower , star , and a snake.

So anything that you see here is only an interpretation of your brain. It 's subjective , which means it is tied to a subject , which is according to your way of interpretation of your brain.

So the only thing that there is here is seven dots made by the E of the Span. That 's the only thing that 's the object. Only one thing. All the other things that you set are subjective.

They are not real. And usually , I 'm going to see what our brain is usually thinking about.

So remember , one , this idea is our subject is , and you can see exactly the object. It 's because our brains are designed in order to connect dots. It needs to end and close the shape. We are the sign for that.

Because our brains are designed in order to close the idea of something. We are never seeing the reality. We can not see the right thing , the object to it. Because when we see something , we are always in lack of information.

So our brain , according to its own ability , will try to close and wrap up the idea.

So we can keep going. This is why the reality is subjective. And because of this natural way of closing the ideas of our brain , every time that usually humans does the question , or wants to know the origin of all things , instead of doing the question , what we do the question. Who created us?

Who am I? Who is God? What are they? They are subjective questions.

Questions are subjective because who is a mental constraint?

So as I said in the post , basically what we are , every living existence in the universe , is only a conjunction of atoms , of molecules , of particles that sometimes behave as particles , sometimes waves in the dimensions. We are kind of an hologram that we do n't really exist. This is just a perception of the mind.

So is the universal mind the one that connect the dots to create a meaning of a who? Of what we are , the idea of what we are.

So what is Matthias here? I am basically a conjunction of particles that moves through waves in different dimensions , according to different wavelengths of frequency. That 's what I am. That was what is Matthias , but who is Matthias?

Who? Matthias is the interpretation of the links that the mind does according to the order of those particles. Who am I? Am I the interpretation of the order between those particles?

This is why when I die and my particle starts to expand again , I stop being Matthias. I expand myself and I become many other things. What I am is interpretation of my own mind , but also what I am , who I am is interpretation of your mind.

So why to the question who am I , who is God? The answer will be always subjective.

So now what is next? That as you have seen , I try to go from the most simple to a bit more complicated to understand a person.

So now when we try to go beyond a person , we go into another dimensions , we go into the masters , the standard masters , we go into guides , angels , demons , our catches , poets , everything that you could possibly imagine. They are subjective. They are norris. But those beings are not real in the same way as we are norris.

They are norris in the same way as we are not real. When you see into your body , you are made up with atoms , particles , molecules.

So imagine that the body of an air angel is made up with arms instead of molecules. From the point of view of an atom , a human does n't exist in the same way as from the point of view of a planet , an arranged does n't exist. Picture the idea of the main arranges , which is Oriel. Oriel comes from the two words , ur and l.

L meaning the birth of queer , which is the vibration itself , and all meaning light.

So Oriel means the vibration , the divine vibration that books the light.

So it 's basically describing the movement in weights of the energy in the universe.

So the objective thing of Oriel is the movement of the energy in weights. That 's Oriel. The subjective idea of the arranges Oriel is the image that we have , the image that we have of this being like a person , a personification of that light. And this that I am explaining is not against the idea that they exist.

It 's not against the idea of channeling , against the idea of able to see them. But in order to understand this , you have to pay attention to I am trying to say instead of trying to listen what you want to listen. Which is really difficult because everything is subjective. Why can I channel the arranges we , because Niel is light?

And we are made of light , of photons.

So whatever particle that is going around in the universe , bringing information data through the particles of light can be downloaded by my Magnetic field , activate information that 's channeling.

So why can I see an arranged or a beam from another dimension? Because when that information comes to me , my brain will try to find the way to close the image of that data in order to see that information. And of course , it will use data that you already have within , which is people , masters. Singing which you believe.

So why is so important the question , because the question , who is the one that helps us to understand the evolution of data in the universe? Is the one that helps us to understand all the information that is in the network?

Remember that culturally , the reason why we speak about God 's divinity is arranges and angels is because we had no other way to explain how the universe was working.

So we used those words.

So there we can say wave instead of spirit , we can say energy instead of soul , can say hologram instead of paradise.

So the only thing that change is really the words , but the content is the same.

So is this now this information pushing you to not to believe in our issues or angels? Not. You can still believe in anything you want. Just another tool to understand a little bit wider why you can believe in them.

The objective question , who is the one that helps us to put a meaning , a unity in the things that objectively are separated and we can not understand them.

So I was explaining all this regarding the arranges to the in the blog because there is one arranged that its name is Michael. That means who like God , who the creator.

So the reason why this being Michael does the question , who like the creator is because someone before someone , someone , the gravity of the creator. The question , who like me. Who like me.

So the reason why this somehow , the gravity of the creator does this question is because the gravity is the one that unified all the other potentials , is universe. And make it make it tangible , touchable. Why? Because of gravity , he is the gravity of the divine.

So this means that all the other potentials are bounded , bounded by time and space , creating an individual.

So it creates something new. And now pay attention here. I 'm not speaking about good beings or bad beings , arranges , angels , seraphins or , and speaking about gravity. We find time and space in one.

Creating an individual , making the manifestation of the divine dream.

So this is the one , the one that can download and manifest time and space and create the self , the ego. The ego is the one that can relate itself according to only one time and only one space.

So this identification and manifestation of the dream has someone against. Because when someone was asking who like me , because it is the only one to create and manifest something , we have the other one against that says who like the am , who like the entire being that we are. And to remind that other being trying to remind it that the manifested ego is just a tiny part of the real being that we are. This individual being that separates from the whole becomes a subject and because it becomes an individual a subject , a self.

It starts to exist according to the beliefs of what it is and not by what it really is. The subject is a belief.

So this makes that ego starts to live their life its lives according to their beliefs and not according to the essence. This is why there is the other face , Michael that ask who like the divine , who like the creator to remind us that the ego is just one tiny thing in all the creation. And this is what we call the fight , the good and the bad and the evil. And that 's why we have demonized the ego.

This ego and this dirt are the I and I.

So in order to really be connected to the divinity , we have to connect to the I am. And now we have a war against one to another. A war by an am. Let 's go again.

Remember what is what are this love. Wisdom and will. What else we have here. Vibration.

Energy. And matter. Six art cannot. And then we have gravity , which is the one that unify all things in the center , the ego.

So the ego asks the question , who like me.

So it goes outside creating its own system. This one here , the ego is the one against in the opposite side of the one ask who like the creator.

So we have two questions here , who like me from the ego and who like the creator from the self. And I am opposite contrary in Hebrew is shaman. That means Satan is the opposite one.

So shaman and detail. Find to another. Trying to find the balance. And all this that we have here is a cube.

So what we have here , the cube , the exahedron , the one that unites all the powers to connect us. To connect us with the divine to the creator. What is this? The cube.

Is the one that in Greek language they call mutation , which means the one that is close to the throne. The mutation is a Greek word that means closer , who is closer to the throne.

So who is the one that is close to the throne? The one that gets to balance the two forces of I and I with the six attributes around. This is the source , the force of all things. And the final thing of all this is that the way in which the ancient language used to call the force of the things was shady.

So may the force be with you. Cool. Is the subjective question? We are just an idea.

So whoever does n't know what is a Jedi , I invite you to see Star Wars from the Shore Lucas. And maybe you will get better what is the force and all this. Let 's go to the element. The vibration for today is you.
