# Day 228 - Flow: Moving Between Structure and Current

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Knees
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Flow, Structure, Conscious Movement
- **Vibration:** `Who`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Will that Guides`
- **Code:** To Believe - by awakening inner wisdom, I recognize that all my attributes were always me, that I am the cosmos that I am, that everything originated from an idea, that all reality and process was a dream, and that in my mind lay all the possibilities, the infinite potential beyond all the tools I now know. For all that, the last attribute I'm awakening is believing, which takes us to the subconscious mind, to the eternal dream and the divine being, where believing is creating.

## Overview

Speaking from Egypt on the day before the spring/autumn equinox, Matias addresses one of his favorite topics: flow.

Tomorrow (Day 229), the 144 gathered in Egypt will be in the three pyramids simultaneously between 5am-7am, activating the 144 aspects during the equinox—a moment that starts something new, sowing seeds for a new time.

Today's teaching clarifies a common spiritual misunderstanding: flow is not the opposite of structure. Both are necessary. The key is learning to flow with consciousness, not irresponsibility.

## The Universe as Ocean

### The Vibrational Wave

The concept of flowing is very important in spiritual awakening. We hear this word constantly because we understand the universe as a vibrational wave—a constant vibrational wave in which we are moving, like waves.

If the entire universe moves like this, it means that to be connected to the universe, we also have to move like that.

We must start to flow, to move flowing with the movements of the universe. This represents the real connection to the proper flowing of the universe, the vibrational movement of the universe.

### The Ocean Metaphor for Pisces

In the month of Pisces, we must keep very present the idea that the whole universe is like an ocean—an ocean that holds many different types of water and many different currents.

For example, on our planet, ocean currents are created because of hot or cold pressures of the atmosphere. But there are also currents in the oceans because of the Coriolis effect—the spinning of the Earth that makes the oceans move.

Even if we see the whole water as one ocean, the ocean holds many different types of waters:
- Deserts in the middle of oceans where nothing lives
- Currents that move constantly
- Seas with different characteristics
- Different types of waters in different oceans

---

## Subconscious, Unconscious, and Conscious

### Three Levels of the Ocean

We can relate the universe to this ocean metaphor in three levels:

1. **Subconscious** = the entire ocean
2. **Unconscious** = the currents of positive and negative
3. **Conscious** = the animals that swim in those currents

In these waters, we have different types:
- Some waters are still, where we can stay and populate
- Other places have currents that are constantly moving, where we can only move through

---

## Billions of Years of Using Currents

### Evolution in the Ocean

Billions of years ago, when life was not yet ready to live on the surface of continents, all living beings lived in the oceans.

Through billions of years, we were designed to use these currents to:
- Migrate
- Look for food
- Escape from weather changes
- Travel and spread along the world

All animals in the oceans got used to using these currents so they could travel along the world and spread.

We all have within us this idea of flow, of current, that helps us move along—not only in the oceans but also in the rivers.

### Inner Ocean: The Circulatory System

This process relates not only to animals in oceans but also to the inner world, the microcosm, where we have the circulatory system.

Through the veins, the arteries, the lymphatic system, all the waters of the body are flowing constantly through the blood and the lymph.

In our inner body, we have this system of distribution that is flowing constantly. The system of distribution nourishes the cells, which are the blocks that create the structures, the patterns that hold all information.

---

## Structure and Flow: Two Systems

### Both Are Necessary

In the entire universe and microcosm, there are two systems:

1. **System of Structure** - helps to manifest ideas, to create reality
2. **System of Flow** - helps connection between structures, helps transformation and evolution, improves information

### How Humans Use Structure

As humans, we have been using the system of structures a lot because of our fear of death.

We don't want to die, so we started to attach ourselves to the structures we create:
- Beliefs in our mind
- Feelings in our emotions, in our soul
- Attitudes in our body

We keep these traditions. We pass these traditions. We do everything according to systems that make us feel secure.

This is why we've been living the past centuries and thousands of years in this kind of structure system—attaching to what we create.

---

## The Awakening Process

### Setting Ourselves Free

Through the process of awakening, when we start to be aware, we realize:

We need to set ourselves free from those systems. We need to let these structures go if we want to transform, to evolve, to set ourselves free from matter.

We start looking for different ways to:
- Heal ourselves
- Transcend our beliefs
- Transcend our emotions
- Transcend the attitudes that kill us and pull us back

### Creating Flow as Escape

In the path of setting ourselves free from structures, we create the idea of flow as a way to escape from structures.

We use the concept of flowing so we can get away from the structures we've created.

---

## The Problem with "Just Flowing"

### Going to the Opposite Extreme

When we start to get out from the system of structures, we immediately as humans try to go to the opposite extreme.

We create flow as something opposite to structure.

We start to say: "I flow. I don't care. I just flow and it doesn't matter."

### Living Only in the Current

When we do that, it's like living in the current all the time—constantly flowing in this current.

What's the problem with this?

In the current, you can only move and transfer information. You look for a better place, better ground, more fertile terrain for manifestations and projects.

But if I never stop, if I constantly flow, I will never be able to manifest anything. I will just be moving around.

### Becoming Irresponsible

When you live your life through just flowing, what happens is you don't take any decision. You live through the current, and the current is the unconsciousness.

Unconsciousness means everyone is ruling your direction. The environment is pushing you where to go.

You're relating all decisions to the group, to the entire, and just letting yourself go, not taking any decision.

Living your entire life through just flowing against systems makes you become irresponsible.

You become irresponsible because you don't take response to your own actions. You're just letting others move you.

## The Balance

### Structure Without Flow

On the other hand, if we get attached to systems and structures, we will not be able to transform ourselves into something transcendental.

We will not be able to improve, to evolve.

### Flow With Consciousness

We need to learn how to flow.

How to flow means:
- To move ahead
- To let ourselves open to new possibilities
- Not expecting anything
- Letting yourself go to new, more fertile terrain
- Opening yourself to receive whatever is coming

**But remember:** you have to learn to flow to allow yourself to transform.

But if you rely all your life on transformation through flowing, you will never be able to manifest.

---

## Flow as a Tool, Not a Way of Life

### The Proper Understanding

To flow properly, we have to become aware, to become conscious of what it is to flow.

Flow is not to leave our life to transformation.

Flow is to understand that:
1. We build something
2. When we lack tools in that space we created
3. We have to let ourselves flow, let it go
4. So we can reach a new place
5. Where we can build something new, transcendental from before

### Flow Is Movement, Not Lifestyle

**Flowing is not a way of life. Flowing is a tool of movement.**

If we leave our lives in the hands of flow, we will never be responsible for our own reality.

But if we don't let ourselves flow, we will always attach to old structures and never evolve.

### Flow With Consciousness

Flow with consciousness.

Consciousness is not to let others move me toward a place, but to use the energy of others to move me toward where I am heading.

---

## Practice

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on breathing.

Take a deep breath. Allow yourself to feel all the energy that goes through your entire body. Feel the heat and the cold in every part of the body.

Perceive how this energy, this flow, moves through each one of the organs and muscles, from your atoms through yourself.

All this energy goes through every artery and vein toward your heart. Feel all these emotions born from heat and cold unite in the center of your heart.

Take a deep breath. Feel how all this energy from heart expands toward every direction. Your body extends, dissolves, starts to flow like clouds expanding in the universe.

Feel the energy that goes through your heart.

Recognize that here and now, your being is a construction, a structure. You are able to build the flow of the entire universe—the constant flow of time and the constant flow of space.

Become aware now that you wouldn't be able to exist without the structure, and you wouldn't be able to exist without the flow.

You are the unity in this constant flow of the cosmos.

Become aware that you are this flow. Set the intention to activate the will to guide yourself, to guide this flow toward your intention.

**I am the one that guides my flow.**

Take a deep breath. Activate this flow.

Sound the vibration **Who** from your knees.

**I am the will that guides. I am the will that guides.**

**I believe. This is how I create.**

**I am the one that guides my flow.**

Take a deep breath and start to bring this consciousness to each part of your body.

## Key Insights

- The universe is a vibrational wave; to connect with it, we must learn to flow.
- The ocean metaphor: subconscious = entire ocean, unconscious = currents, conscious = animals swimming.
- Life evolved using ocean currents to migrate, find food, and spread—we have this flow instinct within us.
- The circulatory system is our inner ocean, flowing constantly to nourish the cells (structures).
- Two necessary systems: structure (manifests reality) and flow (connects structures, enables evolution).
- Humans attach to structures (beliefs, emotions, attitudes) because of fear of death.
- Awakening means setting ourselves free from rigid structures.
- The mistake: making flow the opposite of structure, living only in flow.
- Living only in flow means never stopping to manifest, just moving around without responsibility.
- When you "just flow," the unconscious (everyone else) rules your direction—you become irresponsible.
- Flow is a tool of movement, not a way of life.
- Proper flow: build something, when lacking tools let go and flow to new fertile ground, build again transcendentally.
- Flow with consciousness means using others' energy to move toward where you are heading, not letting them move you randomly.

## Integration

Today, examine your life. Are you:
- Too attached to structures (rigid, unable to change)?
- Too focused on flow (never manifesting, irresponsible)?
- Balanced (building, then flowing to new ground, then building again)?

Practice conscious flow: when you feel stuck in a structure that's no longer serving you, consciously choose to flow. But know where you're flowing toward. Use the current to reach new fertile ground, then build again.

Don't let others move you. Use their energy to move yourself toward your intention.

---

## Week Context

We are in the Physical Week of Pisces, learning to work with the body's relationship to flow and structure.

The knees (today's chakra) are literally where we bend, where we flow. They allow us to move, to walk, to transition. Rigid knees cannot flow; locked knees cannot walk.

Tomorrow is the equinox—a perfect day for the 144 to activate in the pyramids, for it's a moment of balance between structure (Earth's orbit) and flow (seasonal change).

## Q&A

### Q: How do I know when to flow and when to build structure?

When you feel stuck, when tools are lacking, when transformation is needed—flow. When you find fertile ground, when ideas want to manifest, when you have energy to create—build structure. It's a rhythm, not a choice between one or the other.

### Q: Isn't "just flowing" spiritual freedom?

No, it's spiritual irresponsibility. True freedom is conscious choice. Letting the current move you isn't freedom—it's unconsciousness. Freedom is using the current to go where you choose.

### Q: What if I don't know where I'm heading?

Then use flow to explore until you find direction. But don't mistake exploration for a lifestyle. Even exploration needs moments of structure (pausing to integrate what you've learned).

### Q: How is this different from attachment vs. non-attachment?

Attachment is clinging to old structures that no longer serve. Non-attachment is being able to flow when needed. But non-attachment doesn't mean never building—it means building without clinging.

### Q: Can I flow and build simultaneously?

Yes, like the circulatory system—constantly flowing while maintaining structure. The blood flows, the veins provide structure. The ocean currents flow, the seabed provides structure. Flow and structure dance together.

### Q: What does "guide my flow" mean practically?

It means: "I choose the direction. I use the energy available (from others, from circumstances) to move toward my chosen direction." You're the captain using the wind, not a leaf blown by the wind.
