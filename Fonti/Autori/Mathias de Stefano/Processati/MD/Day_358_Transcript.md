## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening to everyone.

Welcome to our day of this week. In the physical wake of cancer.

So we just have other two days of this path. And then the five days out of time to begin our new year. Let 's begin with our topic for today , which is the human consciousness. I have something so ready here.

So just remind you that the five days out of time will be our last connections at 10 , 20 p. M. And August 4 there wo n't be more any other alignments.

## Q&A

Okay , every day. But even though I will make some videos before regarding the task of the 12 systems , for August 22nd.

Okay. That 's begin with human consciousness.

So first of all , talking about what we said yesterday , but what we said yesterday regarding animals , the great family from which we are part of , humans are not another kingdom. Humans are part of the animal kingdom.

Okay. And this is important to make difference. Not difference to make this clarification because sometimes when we speak about this rail , and all these kind of things , we usually can tend to mention the vegetable kingdom , the animal kingdom , and the human kingdom. But it 's important to note that , that biologically speaking and objectively speaking , there 's no human kingdom.

Throughout history , we have kind of called this human kingdom because we are very different from the other animals of this great family of animals. We have cultures , we do many other things that animals do n't do. But actually , there 's nothing , biologically , that separates from any other animal.

So we are part of the animal kingdom. We are not a human kingdom. The only thing that makes a huge difference between humans and animals is how we perceive the world and how we work with our inner conception of the world.

Okay. For sure , when we think about humans and we say about the human kingdom or the importance of this species , bone , the animal kingdom , is because we usually say humans are intelligent. And we describe these species like the only intelligent species and animals are not. And this is a misconception because we know now that many animals are also intelligent.

So the reason why we think that the main difference between humans and animals is the intelligence is a very old point of view and even religious point of view , in which we believe that humans are upon the animals and they are we are better and so we are intelligent and they are not. Actually , they have n't done any tests before with animals like now has been done. There are many animals that are intelligent in nature and not all of them are close to humans like chimpanzees , but there are some other animals like the octopus that they are also clever and intelligent in the same way as a catch or a dog. We sometimes think that you each octopus , but of course they are as intelligent as a pet.

To understand , to understand actually what is intelligent , why they are animals that are intelligent , we have to remember what intelligent means.

So intelligent comes from the Latin word , Inter , Regret , Inter means between and Regret means to read.

So actually the concept means that you are able to read between the lines , which means that if you have different objects in front , you are able to acknowledge the difference between them and create maybe a third one or to create an idea or something new from the group of things that you have in front.

So you can check and take a new object or idea from the tools that you have in front. There would be intelligence. As I said , there are many intelligent beings that you can check many of them that can interpret reality and create a third one. That you can find all the animal kingdom like all the coaches family , which includes dolphins , whales , killer whales , how do you call it?

Orca and also other kind of mammals , like the feline , the canines , the dogs and the cats , horses , parrots , parrots , ravens.

So there are many animals in the animal kingdom that has intelligence. Of course all the apes and all the macacadamaly , they also are intelligent.

So we are not the only ones.

So we can mention many of them like cows , elephants , many of them. What makes humans so special? Why humans are so different from other animal species? First of all , we have to remember that all the animal kingdom and other kingdoms too , but mainly the animal kingdom has these two main difference in how they live the reality , which is the unconscious and the conscious.

The unconscious means that all the things that we inherit from our families , our ancestors , are all in pulses that we inherit as bringing the data from the past and we act in a reaction to that.

So that would be what we share with the animal kingdom , which is to eat , to sleep and to reproduce. Mainly that is what we share with the animal kingdom. When we start to speak about the consciousness of the animal kingdom , we can understand that the animal kingdom have evolved in different ways to supply the unconscious needs.

So they need for food , they need to sleep , they need to reproduce. They were evolving mostly in mammals to develop a way in which they could connect. They could connect in individuals by emotions.

So they started to create in the brain new perceptions of how to become together as one in order to survive.

So they could take care of food , of sleeping , and taking care of one another. Mainly mammals , but also reptiles , some fishes , some birds. They also evolved in a way that they have relationships , they have a communication , they have love , they have fun. And all these emotions , all these cherries with humor , with love and sharing and all these things are not from the animal kingdom , are not from the human kingdom , are from the animal kingdom.

Many animals share these emotions because it helps them to survive.

So they evolve , we evolve in this way in order to improve our survival skills. Because of this , we can not say that also humans are different from the animal kingdom because we have very complex communication system , or because we have emotions and links and traditions , because many animals have the same. And we have a complex system of communication , some of them , they have a very complex relationships with emotion , even getting fun and falling in love.

So that 's not something singular from humans , that 's not original from humans , we took it from the animal kingdom.

So what 's unique of humans?

So what is the main difference in all the animal kingdom and humans? It 's just the idea that we can live and perceive the reality from the subjective point of view , and we even ca n't take the subjective point of view and manifest it into the objective point of view.

So let 's go into that.

So how can we explain why a human does , leads from the subjective point of view , creating the objective point of view. In this way , for example , we can , the world outside is objective means that it has objects , okay , so it 's objective. And you can see things in the outer world , but when you see them as a human , you can perceive that and inside of you have a perception and you create a new idea of it. Totally different from what you are seeing , and inside of you with imagination , you 're able to design it in a different way and then.

And the biggest example of all is to look into the sky and believe in that there is a god in the sky. All the people in the planet have been living and creating cultures and traditions and religions , believing that there is a god in the sky. I got that you can not see that you just ca n't imagine and that 's subjective , that 's something that no other animal species have ever done , because the do n't build realities related to invisible ideas.

So basically the main difference that we humans have with all the rest of the animal species is that we have the ability to see things that are not there. And this is related to everything in every level of a human thing , of a human being.

So for example in religion is believing in a god that you can not see.

So it 's subjective , you just can feel it or try to imagine that , but it 's not objective. In terms of politics , for example , to be from the right to be from the left to be a center. Subjective is not subjective , it 's not something real , it 's just a perception. In education , for example , pedagogy , pedagogy is subjective , it 's not real , it 's just ideas , okay.

In economy , for example , capitalism , communism , free market , that 's all ideologies , that 's just subjective things. We are the only species from the animal kingdom that live a complete life and an entire society and a complete history through topics that does n't exist. And this has two points of view , one good and the other one bad as everything in life.

So the good thing is of course that we would n't have done anything that we have done without that point of view of subjective reality , upon the objective reality. It 's all the arts , all the literature , all the traditions , culture , technology , inventions that we have done in our entire history to be what we are today. It was because we were able to see beyond from what is there in front of us. Did we have to see beyond what is there?

It 's not intelligence , it 's our ability to see the reality in a subjective way.

So the bad thing of this ability is that it would be impossible for anyone to have a main point of support. And the main point of support in which we could all rely and say , that 's the truth because anything that could happen , we will always see it from our point of view.

So truth will be never understood by humans. Because we will always see everything in a subjective way. Basically our greatest ability is our worst weakness.

The reason why we have been doing all this in a bad way is because we are evolving , but because also in the same way as the animals has the unconscious and the conscious way. We also have as humans and unconscious and a human conscious.

So let 's see this. The unconscious point of view of human consciousness , the human unconscious , would be basically that a person that is living through the unconscious. We will be the one that lives its life , believing that everything that that person sees is real. Because we believe that every one of us , we have a background that we inherited from our ancestors of beliefs , traditions from our family , from our cultures , from our history.

And when we receive all that without judging it , without understanding it , which has become unconscious. But we can not make the difference. We can not understand what is real from what is not. We can not , from the unconscious point of view , we can not make the difference between what is at leave or perception from what is the object.

So we are just following by nature , something that comes from other humans.

So our way to understand this unconscious that we have as a humanity that we all share is through morality and ethics. Morality and ethics are like a kind of a list of things that tells you what is good and what is that. But what is good and what is that is a completely subjective reality. For example , the lion that eats the zebra , the lion has no clue what is bad and good and the zebra has no clue what is bad and good.

It just happened.

So they do n't think if it is bad or good what they are doing. They are just doing it. We are the ones that put the subjective projection to the nature , believing one thing is good and one thing is bad. But that is something that a nature does n't exist.

Our subjective point of view is being projected to the reality and we kind of try to put our perception to the entire universe to settle the idea. That the universe works according to our morality and ethics. That 's an unconscious point of view. An unconscious point of view.

For example , in nature there is only one line to follow which is survival. Everyone agrees that we have to survive. But we humans put kind of a value in that which is what is bad and what is good.

So we interpret it that it 's not everything that can kill us.

So we start to measure everything that is bad according to something that can kill us. But nature does n't think about that. Nature is okay. I have to survive.

But it 's not making a morality of thinking what is good and what is wrong. We are the only ones doing that.

So what I want to say with this , I 'm not saying that what we do is bad of saying what is good and what is wrong. I do n't say that that 's wrong , that we are doing it that and that the nature is right because it 's objective.

So what I am saying is that what we are doing unconscious is to project our subjective point of view into something that is objective , which is actually not like this. We are unconscious projecting our point of view into objective , which is not to say , which I 'm not mean actually I 'm not meaning that what we do is wrong of thinking about good and that. Why not because subjective is basically our evolution. Our path of evolution is through ethics and morality.

We have to think it like in this way. Like for example , a monkey that is evolving and is jumping to the other branches.

So they have the branch to try to catch it and it 's evolving. It 's in a process of evolution to try to know how to jump from one to one tree to another.

So we are doing exactly the same with morality and ethics. We are trying to understand what is wrong. In the same way as a monkey is trying to catch the other branch. We are still in process of evolution.

That 's why we are doing a mess with our subjectivity , with our morality and ethics because we have no clue which one is the right one. We are trying to evolve.

So this evolution that we have taken in the subjective way has been something that too cast to a path that made a lot of confusion along history. But even today there is a very misconception from what is subjective and what is objective.

So I spoke about a conflict that today is very powerful for us today. I wrote that in the blog in the blog. Which are two concepts which here racism and no binary sexuality which are very actual topics and for sure many of you wo n't agree with me maybe because everything is subjective. The word race is very old word that sometimes we do n't actually know from where it comes from but one of the probably most accurate origins is the word ras in Arab that means head.

It was a way in which you can difference from one to another. Oh , this has this face , this has this other face , this kind of head.

So it was a way to interpret it. The different kind of people.

So along history , different types of concepts of races started to be used to separate people which was not the goal of the word race , but it was used in order to do that to slave people.

So they started to slave people according to the heads according to the race that they had. And this created this concept , this idea that you can be upon some other race and one is better than one is better than the other. This made that through history the word race racism has been connected to slavery. And just I do n't know , 60 years ago they decided to change this for the word ethnic.

So an ethnic.

So they took the word , they took the word race to call ethnic or ethnicity and ethnicity also means separation , segregation in between different cultures and races is the same word , but it comes from another language and it was used for another thing. It does n't have the same weight , the same heavy from slavery.

So that 's why we are using that. But as you can picture , we are just mentioning the same word , the same concept with the different word just because history and something that was subjective.

So actually we are not taking care of the real problem , which is to accept that there are many races and the beauty of humanity being different. The beauty of humanity is that we have different races and that each one has a specific capacity and every individual is unique. That 's the most important thing to acknowledge about races. The thing is that in history they took that attribute of humanity and they took it against humans.

But what we are doing is just covering now with different words and different concepts , the reality. You can not change the reality that there are many races , but you can put many ideas , subjective ideas upon , but that 's what creates the conflict.

So another example of this is the binary concept of humanity , the no binary. No binary is really a very subjective concept because nobody can tell you what you are. That 's for sure. What do you consider that you are?

A man can feel and recognize itself as a woman. A woman can feel and recognize herself as a man. And that 's no discussion about it because it 's subjective. It 's something that you feel that you know that you have within.

So it 's okay. It 's fine.

So it 's something that I would never disagree with because it 's subjective. It 's something that you feel.

So nobody can tell you nothing against that. If you feel that you are a man or a woman , if you feel that you are no binary. It 's perfect indeed actually when our human evolution is trying to go to that neutrality. It 's going to try to understand that we are all one and that from the subjective point of view , there 's no need to make a difference between feminine and masculine.

That 's that 's of course that that 's something that I am also I also agree with that. But when we go to the objective , there is only binary unless you are a human for dying. There is masculine and feminine. And that 's it.

Those are the two sexes that you can find.

So it 's a really huge problem sometimes when maybe you have , I do n't know , I conflict and someone has to attend you like in them with medicine. And maybe you say I 'm a man but you are a woman and they put you some medicine that is not good for a woman. You know , this kind of things that objectively in biology , you can not say I am a woman if you 're a man. That 's what I mean.

So objectively your body is woman or male. Subjective you can meet whatever you want. But this is our human evolution , the conflict that we have here is that we are trying again through consciousness to put our subjective point of view into the objective point of view. That 's the main conflict that we are having.

How do we become conscious? What is human consciousness? Human consciousness is when we take our subjective point of view in order to relate and connect the different objective point of objective realities. And it 's all for this.

We can understand the next. Most of the animals and other species and vegetables , they do n't have a specific idea of the other one. Just a few species of animals like dogs , cats , whales , dolphins , some of those species of those mammals. They are aware of the other ones of the other species.

But they do n't have the clue exactly of the other one being a group of something and what place that other being is occupying in the entire network of the planet. Actually the humans are the only animals that can relate why every species is important is the only animal that can study each one of them. And look for solutions to solve their problems. Because we , subjective , can see a network connecting all of them.

This is why from subjective point of view humans can help many species , can help to create an network to help the planet and global warming and so on. Because we can see beyond from what animals see right there. The animals see right there the problem. We can see beyond the future.

So because we see a reality in a subjective way in different from all the animals , we can prevent and make a provision of the problem.

So we can think about the solutions.

So I 'm speaking about the conscious. I 'm not speaking about the unconscious. Because the unconscious , like most of the humans , if they have to cut trees , they cut trees to be houses because everyone has done that in the past. Everyone has cut trees.

So why not cut trees.

So that 's unconscious. I 'm just speaking about conscious. The subjective point of view is the one that helps humans to see the future to imagine the future. And of course , to solve problems in an network.

A very conscious aspect of humans of humanity is that our ability to see beyond in a very subjective way is the one that allows us to see them visible. And that makes us the only species that can leave a reality through a multidimensional idea. We can perceive everything through a multidimensional reality and we create our civilizations according to a multidimensionality. This means that we can think about the divine concept and connected to the worldly concept.

So we can connect heaven and earth.

So our conscious aspect in evolution is to be a bridge between many dimensions between heaven and earth. And that makes us the only animal that can connect the external world with the internal world and manifest through all the dimensions our internal world into external world.

## Daily Practice Elements

So there are animals that can perceive other dimensions , but they can not manifest those dimensions here. Basically our species is evolving in a consciousness related to a multidimensionality that can unite the subjective point of view with the objective point of view and to manifest the invisible into the visible. The vibration today is cool. The statement today is I am the root of time.

The code today is the node of how I connected to the constellation of cancer. Sit comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing.

Now I am gettingوera. Ready and go. I take it to breath and I become aware of my entire physical body and my feet to my head. I become aware about my human body and intention to each part of it to every cell.

And how they wear the sign in order for me to be a human. I honor my feet and legs for allowing me to walk to stun still. I honor my hands and arms that allow me to handle , to make , to create my back. I am finally , closely , from heaven to earth , in an axis as my face can see the sky and the horizon.

I honor the body that I have , which is a bridge in between the divine and the world. I am a Sergeant carries all my body , giving to myself the love of being human. I am a Sergeant carries all my body , giving to myself the love of being human. I am a Sergeant carries all my body , giving to myself the love of being human.

I am a Sergeant carries all my body , giving to myself the love of being human. I am a Sergeant carries all my body , giving to myself the love of being human. I can not knowledge that my multidimensional reality as a conscious being allows me to connect. It is different consciousness from the mineral elemental , ventitult and animal , with a consciousness of the universe , existential , all with the atom.

## Energy Work

I recognize myself as this aware species that can see me on from what it is that can connect invisible with the visible. This is why I recognize myself as responsible and conscious for all the kingdoms of this world. For I am the only species that is able to manifest invisible in the visible , the subjective into the objective. For I can see me on space , for I am a root of time.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. And to be aware of time is what makes me a unique species in the undertaking of me. I can feel the time , I feel , I feel , I feel.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time.

I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time. I am the root of time.
