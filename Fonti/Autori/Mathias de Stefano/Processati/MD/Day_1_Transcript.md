## Overview
Welcome to Day 1 of the 360-day Conscience Year. We're going to work together to align our consciousness and connect with each other. The main goal is to create a flow of connection between our minds, bodies, and physical world. We'll be using ancient systems and structures to guide us on this journey. Our focus will be on coherence, alignment, and the connection between our individual selves and the universe.

The year is divided into 12 months, each with three weeks of 10 days. Each week represents a different aspect of our being: mental body, emotional body, and physical body. We'll be working with 12 chakras, each representing a portal to the spiritual mind. Our goal is to activate these portals and connect with the higher self.

We'll be using a specific mantra, "I Can," throughout the year. This mantra will help us manifest our intentions and align with our higher selves. We'll also be working with music and vibration to create a sense of coherence and alignment.

Our first day is related to the constellation of Leo, and we'll be focusing on the concept of the "I Am" for this month. We'll be using a specific code of the day, which will help us connect with the spiritual mind and activate our portals.

## Core Teaching

### Ancient Systems and Structures
We're going to work with ancient systems and structures to guide us on this journey. These systems have been used for centuries to connect with the spiritual mind and activate our portals.

#### Pyramid System
We'll be working with the pyramid system, which represents the connection between our individual selves and the universe. The pyramids are natural portals that allow us to connect with the higher self.

#### Temple System
We'll also be working with the temple system, which represents the connection between our spiritual minds and the universe. Temples are portals to the divine, and we'll be using them to activate our mantras and connect with our higher selves.

### Chakra Explanations
Each chakra represents a portal to the spiritual mind. We'll be working with 12 chakras, each representing a different aspect of our being.

#### Crown Chakra
The crown chakra is the highest chakra, representing the connection between our individual selves and the universe. It's the portal to the higher self, and we'll be activating it throughout the year.

#### Other Chakras
We'll also be working with other chakras, each representing a different aspect of our being. The mental body, emotional body, and physical body are all connected through these chakras.

### Portal System
Our portal system is based on the concept of the "I Am." We'll be using this mantra to connect with our higher selves and activate our portals.

#### Portal Activation
We'll be activating our portals throughout the year, using specific codes and mantras. This will help us connect with our higher selves and align with the universe.

### Code of the Day
Our code of the day is related to the concept of "Inhalation." This code represents the breath of life, and we'll be using it to connect with our higher selves and activate our portals.

#### Inhalation Code
The inhalation code is a specific sequence of sounds that will help us connect with our higher selves. We'll be using this code throughout the year to activate our portals and align with the universe.

### Tools
We'll be using specific tools to connect with our higher selves and activate our portals. These tools include:

#### Three Spheres
We'll be using three spheres to connect with our higher selves. These spheres represent the connection between our individual selves and the universe.

#### Body Scan
We'll be doing a body scan to connect with our physical bodies and activate our portals. This will help us align with the universe and connect with our higher selves.
