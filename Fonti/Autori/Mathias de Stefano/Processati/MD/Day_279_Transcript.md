## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening , tell of you with our day related to any calls. Our topic for today is going forward.

So I think that with food , comfort is kind of the main goal of the spirit of tourists. Because of this energy of tourists needing to be in comfort , let 's talk about what comfort means and what are our points of view of comfort today , how we can stand on the use it in a positive way in which are the negative ways. In which we can see it. Comfort comes from gone that means with and for this that means strong.

It means the unity of strength.

So let 's go into this.

Now that I , so you can have the , let 's see , the word comfort. And the word comfort comes from gone meaning with and for this meaning strong.

So this means that all the forces are together. What is the intention of this word that we usually apply the forces in order to move forward to the sound and the outside. But here we are doing exactly the opposite. We are putting all the forces together in one place.

This is why we are not doing any outside. We are just holding the forces inside. That 's why comfort means to grab and have whole all the forces in one place. The word , comfort , is given by comfort.

Which means coming from the word gone meaning with , for means meaning form or shape and is must that means to move.

So to conform , conformity would be the idea of having one shape.

So the being the person that is not willing to transform. The one that is not willing to transform will form.

So you are not transforming yourself. You are conforming yourself , which is to behold the , to hold in yourself only one shape. These three words , these words are the ones that we will , to try to explain from its positive way of seeing it and the negative way of seeing it.

So once we have been talking about energy and how the universe illustrates energy. Everything the universe is trying to illustrate energy in order to keep going.

So for sure we know that aspect of the universe in which , in which we say the universe is transforming constantly. But the main key of the universe is to save energy. The conservation of energy is one of the main laws of the universe. Everything is trying to conserve energy.

Everything is trying to save the energy for itself because when you transform , it takes a lot of energy.

So the universe tries to keep the shape in order to hold the energy inside and not to waste energy in the process of transformation.

So this is why all structures in the universe are conforming itself in systems to hold , save and conserve energy. This is why you can understand that the universe is kind of the biggest conformity in the existence.

Okay , so I do n't know if this changed your point of view of the universe now , but actually this is how it works. It is trying to conform structures to energy. But what happened that in this movement of trying to store energy? The particles are trying to energy from other atoms from other structures , so they could shape their own form and wrap the energy.

So they can conform themselves.

So what happened in this movement trying to store energy is that in this movement of the particles , they create waves , taking the energy from the others. And these waves create different frequencies. And those frequencies move the environment for the other particles to restore the structure.

So they can take the shape again. Imagine this.

Now we have here three pence and it is one two pence.

Okay , so this one here needs an energy because it has a lack of energy.

So you will reach also to here and you will find the negative in this one.

So they will attract the negative to create balance and conform the shape to storage energy. But this one here now does n't have it.

So it will do as much as possible to try to get it back or to look it into another structure. What we have here is that in this constant sig for conformation conformity to have a storage of energy , we also have constant transformation. Confirmation transformation , conformation transformation is constant. We can understand here that the universe is completely looking to be confirmed.

Confirms because it tries to conform shapes all the time. But at the same time it creates instability of waves and vibrations trying to do that.

So that 's why also the universe is a constant transformation. The universe is both things at the same time. This same structure goes all along the universe and existence.

So the same example as I did with the pence now we are going to do it in nature. In nature this structure evolves in plants and animals.

So everyone is trying to reach a shape. For example a plant , the signs shape to storage energy. A plant grows and brings light to the energy in the inside. But what happened , the environment also designed another shapes which are animals that are trying to reach that energy.

So they will eat the plant.

So the plant will be an environment that is changing.

So that 's why the plant has to adapt to grow up.

So the animals can eat the leaves to be stronger or to have some thorns or to be poisoned.

So it can adapt to the change in environment that is also looking for the energy.

So as you see everything in nature will be looking to conform at the same time that is trying to adapt according to the changes in the environment.

So we humans we did exactly the same. We humans evolved into this shape so we conform ourselves as humans as we know ourselves. And with this shape I have to try to reach as much energy as possible and storage keep safe as much energy as possible.

So now what happened if we humans have evolved having shapes. Full so we conform ourselves as living being. We eventually we did something different and transcendental than just administer the energy in our forms. We started to think we started to be aware of ourselves with to look for different ways in order to demonstrate that energy that we have.

So we started to separate us from the realms of the vegetables from the realms of the animals which are realms that tries to storage that energy within and we started to storage this energy outside. Like in cultures in farms in a society in more areas in knowledge we started to design tools from the outer body that it does n't include our physical shape. It includes our intelligent and intelligence and how can manifest that outside.

So this means that we found other mediums ways in which we can do things not only by changing our form but also by designing ways mediums to do that. And that 's when we get used to one medium to make something to a still energy is when we design the idea of confirmed. Because we put all our strength our forces into one way. We say , oh this is the way that helps us.

So all our strength , our forces will be dedicated into this way to storage energy. And that 's what we call confirmed.

So now we can understand from here how we came from the concept of conformation to the concept of confirmed.

So as you see till now , I have n't spoke about this process being like lazy. In our conception today speaking about conformity , we used to relate these two words with being lazy. But I have n't spoken to you see it 's just ways to storage energy.

Now try to go into understand why we relate these concepts with being lazy. By nature we conform ourselves in order to storage and save energy. And by intelligence we find ways to put all this strength together in order to save energy that we call confirmed.

So throughout history when we have done is to create cultures , traditions , ceremonies that helps us keep the ways in order to feel comfortable. And why is that? Because to get comfort , to get comfort. You get that when you accomplish to get the three needs.

So the need of food , the need of sleeping and the need of reproduce reproduction.

So when you reach this three by your work , you get comfort. What is this comfort? It 's not to stay not doing anything. It 's to work in order to get this three.

You see the difference?

So let 's repeat it again just in case.

Remember , comfort for the history of humanity is not related with laziness like we related today. Consort is related to the product that we get through the hard work that reach to give us food , sleep and production.

Okay?

So it 's a very different point of view from what we have today.

So through centuries , ideas of the Indo-European cultures from Asia and Europe started to design these traditions of work as something important to get comfort.

So everyone had to work hard in order to get comfort.

So this culture has created this tradition that you will only get comfort if you keep doing the same way and using your forces into one straight line. That 's what we created these kind of traditions in which we feel comfort doing the same things. And we feel that I feel I feel comfortable not changing the ways because until now they have worked for me. You see how it came in the history.

So it 's a tradition that for ourselves it worked because we are alive because of repeating that.

So we do n't want to change that comfort.

So throughout history what cultures and religion will start to design is the confirmation of a structure that ca n't storage and save energy with many individuals. On a certain spot that repeats the same comfort and that 's what we call a region or a zone of comfort.

So this comfort zone go from the control limits of the country to the clans , from the clans to the families , from the families to the individuals that keeps the comfort and the culture. This is the comfort according to their feelings , their beliefs , thoughts and so on.

So what happened that in the last centuries or a thousand years or so. This fell down. The middle ages started. And the times of principles of feudalism and kingdoms started again during a period of time in which a lot of people from hunger.

And even if they worked every day , they would never reach the comfort zone. There was so much difficulties to get comfort , to get a shape to storage energy that. We started to transform a lot.

So a lot of changes were happening during that period. During this process of transformation revolution started and also the revolutions brought independence mainly in the Americas.

So all the people from the old world started to move to the Americas , reaching for the American dream. In which all these people realized that in that land anyone could do whatever and reach comfort. Because there were a lot of opportunities. We started to call this lands like the lands of opportunities.

In reality , the dream was much more like a nightmare because it was not a perfect dream. Terri , even though it was better than the reality they were living in Europe or in the parts of the world.

So besides philosophy , because we can discuss about philosophy and if it was rumored or right , let 's go to the facts. In Europe , the people were in the feudalism and all the people had not opportunities to grow because of that system of absolute system. But in the Americas , in all the countries of America , the feudalism was a bit less. And the republics , all the people were able to grow even if they were poor.

So that created many opportunities.

So that 's why in the Americas people started to be much more rich and have much more comfort.

So we can see that the countries in the Americas , that today we have social crisis , in that time , in where like the most important countries , rich countries. The excess of resources gave something to people , which was time. Because a lot of people did n't need to work all day in order to reach things.

So they started to have time.

So much more comfort. Once we started to evolve and we solved the problems of food , sleep and produce , we found a new one. Which was to have fun. Time.

We had a bit more of time. We did n't have to work so much to reach this three.

So we much more time to have fun. And remember that that free time. In many periods of the history , it was not just to play. It was just to read , to learn something that was related with get fun.

So after what happened to this situation of having much more time , war comes and with that the second industrial revolution , the technology. Expanding in the world. And suddenly we have to re-adapt again. Every time the humanity lived across this , we need to transform.

We could n't have conformity. We need to transform.

So suddenly machines started to work instead of humans and humans needed to form into a different kind of jobs. In the last century , we have lived one of the biggest transformations in the entire humanity. And that technology transformation brought a lot and much more free time. In the last three and a half , we accomplished to get weakens.

We accomplished to get work times. We started to have much more free time. And as much the technology starts to evolve , the less we need to put effort into get results. We started to have holidays , something really difficult to centuries back.

Because of this change of concept of time , we started to relate , comfort and confirmation. With the idea of not doing anything. Not willing to do something because we do n't need to. That started to be easy.

Losing is related to this idea now , the trust.

Now.

So important to understand this. This works , comfort and confirms. Are not related with laziness. We related today with laziness because of our environment and our context in history.

But the origin of the words and the concept itself of comfort and conclusion , there are systems that keep the tradition of doing something to get a benefit from it. They are different.

So get this idea. Life is a constant of stability and movement.

So life is a constant of confirmation and transformation. Confirmation , transformation , transformation.

So we can not be all the time transforming ourselves. Neither all the time being the same. It is a constant that we do. Evolution is the constant of these two.

Without stability , without confirmation , we would n't be what we are now. Without transformation , we would n't have reached what we have reached to be now. Here is when we understand the concept of conformity. The problem here , the mistake that we use to do in this process of evolution , is that we get attached to the forms that we got.

When we say , this is the form that I got and this is the best form.

So I am really afraid of changing that form because I do n't know if I will lose everything. If I change this , what I am going to do next.

So that is why I am rather to grab to this shape , to this form.

So pay attention to conformity. Is one of the aspects of evolution. Confirms is the conflict of the attachment to one of those forms. You see the difference.

Conformity is the link in evolution. Confirms is the attachment to one of forms. This is why we relate conformity with the idea of laziness , of not being willing to transform to something different. Confirms comes from the fear that I have to change and the security that I feel in the traditions that kept me alive.

And we can not judge someone that is conformity. We can not judge someone like this. Because that person is a threat of change. It 's not too simple to be like that.

It 's a threat of what would happen. We would n't be unconditional loving if we judge someone with fear.

So now let 's see this. If conformity and transformation is the constant evolution. This means that in order to go with evolution , I have to recognize that I should not be in only one spot. That confirmation and transformation lives within me.

And that means that I am the way I have this strength. The force is living within me in order to transform and to evolve. And for that , I have to do something very important , which is to feel comfortable with myself. Feel comfort in me.

Not in another place , not in something outside , but me. Maybe it 's silly , but many people does n't feel comfortable with themselves. The shapes , the forms that they have with the thinking , the place where they leave , instead they do the motions that feel , we do n't feel comfortable with that many of us. And because we do n't feel comfortable with ourselves , we reach for this comfort somewhere else.

And that somewhere else is what we call the comfort zone. The comfort zone basically is each one of the moments of stability. And I finish with this.

So looking to this , I keep life is like a little train , where we have moments of stability , which are the ease. Stability , stability , stability , and lines are movement movement movement.

So we are in this train , stability movement , stability movement. Imagine this , that here , every one of these stability points is a confirmation , which means that you take a form that you get a shape , a form for something. And every line will be a transformation , which means to go from one form to another. It 's easy , I guess , with this picture.

So this would be life is a constant of confirmation , confirmation , transformation , and so on.

So this region here , the zone , is a place like a train station , where the movement stops.

So we can call zone one , zone two , zone three , zone four , zone five , okay , or different train stations where we are going to stop.

So this zones will be called the zone of confirmation. And because all trains that I am putting all the forces of the movement are stuck here and rich this place , that 's what we call the comfort zone.

So in order for me to go forward in life , I have to go out from the comfort zone. And the reason why we do n't go out from the comfort zone is because we have no idea why it 's expecting for us in the other stations.

So that 's why you are afraid to move forward. And from where this fear comes from , from the things that I have lived in the previous stations.

So how do I get out from this? It 's not watching ahead , like people saying , the future would be better than we move forward. No , that 's not the way to do it. It would be hard.

The best way to do it is look backwards to the previous stations to look behind and to see all the stations that I have lived and all the station that I have left.

So rich where I am.

So I can recognize that I have left many comfort zones and now I 'm better than before.

So that 's what will give me the inertia to move forward into the next step. And with this , I want to say to all of you , do n't be ashamed. Do n't be ashamed of feeling in a comfort zone. Do n't be ashamed to feel that you are a comforts.

Maybe first you are just in one of those train stations. Let 's go to information for today. The vibration for today is. The statement for today is I am origin of every destiny.
