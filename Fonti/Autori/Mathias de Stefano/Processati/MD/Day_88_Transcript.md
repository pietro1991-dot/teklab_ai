# Day 88 - Life and Death

## Overview

Today connects with knees chakra in Libra Physical Week, exploring life and death. Knees represent path, direction—movement forward or backward in history, ancestors.

We're in Egypt now. Yesterday, my Instagram account hacked from Turkey. Weird thing because Turkey is where I aligned pyramids few days ago. Now Turkey having earthquake at 6.9 magnitude—many people died.

This earthquake happened exactly where we were aligning pyramids—same place. Some people wrote me saying they felt earthquake when we did alignment. Now physical earthquake came. Coincidence? I don't think so.

Today I want talk about life and death because of earthquake. Many people ask: "Why do people have to die? Why earthquakes, catastrophes kill people?" These questions come from misunderstanding what death is.

Life and death are not opposites fighting each other. They're complementary parts of same movement—same process of transformation. When you understand this, death becomes teacher, not enemy.

## Core Teaching

### Life: Persistent Movement

Life comes from word meaning to be persistent, constant. Life is label we give to constant movement, constant transformation.

When we say something is alive, we mean it moves, changes, transforms constantly. Life is not static state—it's process of continuous movement.

Life is everywhere. Even rock is alive because atoms inside it move constantly. Everything moves, vibrates. This is why third law says: nothing stops, everything moves, vibrates.

Life is label for persistence of movement. When movement continues, we say there's life.

### Death: Transformation, Not Stopping

Death comes from word meaning to end, to stop. But this is misunderstanding.

Death is not stopping of movement. Movement never stops. Death is transformation—end of one form, beginning of another.

When we say someone died, we mean their form transformed. Energy didn't stop—it changed structure. Body returns to Earth, consciousness continues elsewhere.

Death is rethinking, reimagining, restructuring. It's end of one experience, beginning of next.

Ancient cultures understood this. They didn't fear death—they prepared for it. They taught children from birth: "Welcome to path toward death." Not scary, not tragic—natural.

### Dying Many Times in Life

You don't have to wait for body to die to experience death. You die many times while living.

Every transformation is death. When child becomes teenager, child dies—teenager is born. When teenager becomes adult, teenager dies. When you leave job, old identity dies. When you end relationship, that version of you dies.

Life is series of deaths—constant transformations. You're dying and being reborn every moment.

This is why learning to die while living is most important teaching. When you embrace death as transformation (not enemy), you embrace life fully.

### Transcendence vs. Resurrection

In Turkey earthquake, 12 people transcended. I don't say "died"—I say transcended.

Transcendence means passing through—going from one state to another without losing consciousness. These 12 people passed through death consciously, aware.

Most people resurrect. Resurrection means you die unconsciously, then reincarnate later. You lose consciousness, forget, start again.

Transcendence is different. You pass through death aware, conscious. You don't forget. You continue without interruption.

Jesus wasn't only one to transcend. We call it resurrection because mistranslation, misunderstanding. Everyone reincarnates (resurrects). Few transcend.

These 12 in Turkey earthquake transcended because they were ready. They prepared. When earthquake came, they passed through consciously.

### Ancient Cultures Prepared Children for Death

In ancient cultures (Egypt, Tibet, Indigenous Americas), they taught children about death from beginning.

They said: "You came here to die. Your whole life is path toward death. Prepare for it. Learn to die consciously so you can transcend."

This wasn't scary—it was loving. When you know death is transformation, natural part of life, you live differently. You don't fear. You embrace each moment knowing it's temporary, precious.

They practiced dying while living. Meditation, sleep, deep transformation—all practice for final death. When time came, they were ready. They transcended.

Modern culture does opposite. Hides death, fears it, pretends it won't happen. Then when it comes, people panic, resurrect unconsciously, forget everything.

Which is better? Prepare and transcend, or fear and forget?

### Point A to Point B: Line Is Experience

Life is journey from point A (birth) to point B (death). Line between them is experience—what you live.

Death of point A is beginning of point B. End of one is start of next. This is continuous cycle.

When you understand this, you see: there's no final death, only transformations. Each end is new beginning.

Your job: make line (experience) as full as possible. Feel, perceive, transform as much as you can. When you reach point B, you'll be ready for next point A.

This is path of evolution.

## Practice: Knees Chakra Activation

**Preparation:**
- Comfortable position
- Stretch body, massage, warm
- Let weight fall, relax, focus breathing

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation sequence

**Knees Work:**

19. Pay attention to higher self above you
20. Help descend through crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacral, root, knees
21. Knees hold all ancestors—history, path you walked to be here
22. With both hands, massage knees deeply (circles around kneecap, sides, back of knees)
23. Feel all generations in your knees—all who walked before you
24. Perceive knees as portal: forward (future, where you're going) and backward (past, where you came from)
25. Thank ancestors who walked path so you could be here
26. Ask: What death am I ready for? What transformation is calling me?

**Integration:**

27. Relax hands, allow perceive sensations at knees
28. Vibrate: SSfunu

## Integration

**Daily:** Notice small deaths—transformations you experience. Child dying, teenager being born. Old belief dying, new understanding emerging. Embrace these.

**Weekly:** Knees chakra practice, massage deeply. Feel ancestors who walked before you. Ask: What transformation is calling me?

**Monthly:** Practice dying consciously. In meditation, imagine letting go of body, identity, everything. Pass through aware. This prepares you.

**Ongoing:** Remember: ancient cultures prepared children for death from birth. You can start now. Death is teacher, transformation is natural. When you learn to die while living, you transcend.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If death is transformation, why is it painful?**
A: Physical pain is body's response. Emotional pain is attachment to form. When you understand death as transformation (not loss), pain transforms too. Still feel it, but don't suffer.

**Q: How do I know if I'll transcend or resurrect?**
A: Practice dying while living. Meditation, deep transformation, letting go of identity. If you're conscious in these, you'll be conscious in final death. That's transcendence.

**Q: Why did 12 people transcend in Turkey earthquake?**
A: They were ready. Maybe they prepared (ancient teachings), maybe they aligned during pyramid work. When earthquake came, they passed through consciously instead of panicking.

**Q: Is resurrection (reincarnation) bad?**
A: Not bad—just unconscious. You forget, start again. Transcendence is conscious—you remember, continue. Both are natural. One requires preparation, one doesn't.

**Q: How can I prepare for death?**
A: Practice dying in small ways. Let go of identities, beliefs, attachments. Meditate on dissolution. Sleep consciously (sleep is practice death). When final death comes, you'll be ready.

**Q: If I die many times while living, is physical death different?**
A: Same process, bigger scale. Every transformation is death (small). Physical death is transformation (large). When you master small deaths, large death becomes natural.

**Q: What about people who die suddenly without preparation?**
A: Most resurrect (reincarnate unconsciously). But some surprise themselves—in moment of death, something awakens. You never know what soul prepared before birth.

**Q: How did ancient cultures teach children about death without scaring them?**
A: They made it natural. "You came here to die—whole life is path toward that." Not threat, just truth. When death is natural (not hidden), children don't fear. They prepare.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching brings death out of shadow into light. Life is persistent movement. Death is transformation. They're not enemies—they're partners in continuous evolution.

You die many times before body dies. Every transformation—child becoming teenager, old job ending, relationship transforming—is death. When you recognize this, you learn most important skill: dying consciously while living.

Ancient cultures prepared children from birth: "Welcome to path toward death." Not scary, just true. Modern culture hides death, fears it, pretends. Result? When death comes, panic, unconscious resurrection, forgetting.

Turkey earthquake took many, transcended 12. Transcendence is passing through death aware, conscious. Resurrection is dying unconsciously, reincarnating later, forgetting. Jesus wasn't only one to transcend—we all can. But it requires preparation.

Your knees hold all ancestors who walked path before you. They died so you could be born. You'll die so others can be born. This is line of evolution—point A to point B, experience between.

Your job: make experience (line) as full as possible. Feel, perceive, transform. Practice dying in small ways so when big death comes, you're ready. Meditate on dissolution. Sleep consciously. Let go of identities, beliefs, attachments.

When you learn to die while living, death becomes teacher instead of enemy. You embrace each moment knowing it's temporary, precious. You transform consciously instead of clinging to form.

You are path of evolution when you recognize: life is series of deaths, death is series of births, all is transformation. No final end, only continuous movement. Prepare now. Practice dying. When time comes, you'll transcend instead of forgetting.

That's the teaching. That's the path.
