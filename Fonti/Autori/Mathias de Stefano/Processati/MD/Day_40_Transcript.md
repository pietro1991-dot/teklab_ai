## Overview

Day 40 completes the 10-day cycle that began on Day 31. This is the day of **acceptance**—not in the sense of passive resignation, but in the sense of **integration**: accepting all aspects of yourself as necessary, valid, and sacred.

The teaching centers on the **trinity of body, soul, and spirit**, but reframes them in Matias's cosmology: **body, soul, and spirit are not three separate things. They are three different vibration speeds of the same consciousness.**

- **Body = low vibration** (solid, slow, dense)
- **Soul/Emotion = medium vibration** (liquid, flowing, medium speed)
- **Spirit/Mind = high vibration** (gas, fast, expansive)

Think of water: ice, liquid water, and steam. Same substance (H₂O), three states, three different vibration speeds. **You are not a spirit trapped in a body. You are consciousness expressing at three different frequencies simultaneously.**

This teaching directly confronts **spiritual bypassing**—the tendency to value spirit over body, to try to "transcend" the physical, to escape into the high vibrations and ignore the slow, heavy work of embodiment.

The Toroid chakra—the energetic field that encompasses the whole body and extends beyond it—is the perfect vehicle for this teaching. The toroid isn't located in one spot; it's the **field generated by all the chakras working together**. It's the integration point, the unified field.

Acceptance means: **Stop trying to only be spirit. Stop devaluing the body. Stop rushing the slow processes.** The body processes at body speed. Emotions process at emotion speed. Mind processes at mind speed. If you try to force your body to process at mind speed, you create trauma. If you try to live only in your mind and ignore your body, you fragment.

The task is radical: **accept all three levels of yourself with equal reverence.** Accept that your mind might understand something instantly, but your emotions might take weeks to catch up, and your body might take months. **That's not a problem. That's the design.**

## Core Teaching

### The Toroid: The Field of Integration

Good morning, good evening, good night, everyone. Today we complete the 10-day cycle. We complete the work with the root chakra in the mental, the mind week.

Today we are working specifically with the **toroid**—the toroid, the chakra that is the energetic field around and through the entire body.

The toroid is not located in one place. It's the field generated when all the chakras are activated and aligned. It's the egg of light around you. It's the magnetic field. **It's the integration of all parts into one unified whole.**

We've worked through 10 days: qualities, truths, utility, attachments, creations, attributes, advance, destination. Today we complete with **acceptance**.

### Acceptance: Not Approval, But Integration

First, let's clarify what acceptance means. **Acceptance doesn't mean you approve of everything. Acceptance means you acknowledge what IS without resistance.**

Acceptance means: "This is here. This is true. This exists." It doesn't mean you like it. It doesn't mean you won't change it. It means **you stop fighting reality and start working WITH it.**

In the context of the self, acceptance means: **I acknowledge all parts of myself—the parts I like and the parts I don't, the parts I'm proud of and the parts I'm ashamed of, the parts that are easy and the parts that are hard.**

Today, specifically, we're accepting the **trinity of body, soul, and spirit** within us.

### Body, Soul, Spirit: Three Speeds, One Consciousness

Usually, we think about body, soul, and spirit as three separate things—three different aspects or layers of who we are.

But in the cosmology we've been learning, **body, soul, and spirit are not three separate things. They are three different vibration speeds of the same consciousness.**

Let me explain with the metaphor we've been using all month: **vibration and frequency**.

- **Spirit/Mind = high vibration = fast frequency**. This is the aspect of you that can think quickly, understand instantly, process information at the speed of light. This is your mind, your spirit, your connection to high consciousness.

- **Soul/Emotion = medium vibration = medium frequency**. This is the aspect of you that feels, that flows, that moves more slowly than thought but faster than the body. This is your emotional self, your soul.

- **Body = low vibration = slow frequency**. This is the densest, slowest aspect. This is your physical body, which processes experiences slowly, which changes slowly, which carries memory in tissue and bone.

### The Water Metaphor: Ice, Water, Steam

Think of water. **Water can exist as ice, as liquid water, and as steam.**

- Ice is **low vibration**—solid, slow-moving, dense. This is like the body.
- Liquid water is **medium vibration**—flowing, adaptable, medium-speed. This is like the soul/emotions.
- Steam is **high vibration**—gaseous, fast-moving, expansive. This is like the spirit/mind.

**It's all water. It's all H₂O. Just at different vibration speeds.**

You are not three separate things. **You are one consciousness vibrating at three different speeds simultaneously.**

### The Problem: Spiritual Bypassing

Here's where most spiritual seekers make a critical error: **they try to only be the steam. They try to only be spirit.**

They devalue the body. They try to "transcend" the physical. They want to live in the high vibrations of mind and spirit and ignore the slow, heavy, dense reality of the body.

This is what we call **spiritual bypassing**. It's the attempt to skip over the body, to escape the slow processing, to avoid the hard work of embodiment.

But here's the truth: **You NEED all three. You can't exist as only steam.**

If you're only steam, you have no form, no container, no way to act in the physical world. **Steam dissipates. It has no substance.**

You need the ice. You need the slow, solid, dense body. **The body is not a prison. The body is the vessel. The body is the way consciousness can ACT in the physical dimension.**

### Different Processing Speeds: The Design, Not the Problem

Here's something crucial to understand: **each level processes at its own speed.**

- **Mind/Spirit processes FAST.** You can have an insight in an instant. You can understand something intellectually in a moment.

- **Emotions/Soul process MEDIUM speed.** You might understand something intellectually, but it takes days or weeks for your emotions to catch up, for you to FEEL the truth of it.

- **Body processes SLOW.** You might understand something intellectually and feel it emotionally, but it takes months or years for your body to integrate it, for it to change the patterns in your tissue, your posture, your nervous system.

**This is not a problem. This is the design.**

### The Trauma of Speed-Forcing

Most of our trauma comes from trying to force all three levels to process at the same speed.

You have an insight (mind), and you expect your body to instantly change. When it doesn't, you judge yourself as "not committed enough" or "not evolved enough."

You decide to change a behavior (mind), and you expect your emotions to immediately align. When you still feel the old fear or anger, you think you've failed.

**But the body can't process at mind speed. The emotions can't process at mind speed.**

If you try to FORCE them to, you create trauma. You override your body's signals. You suppress your emotions. You fragment yourself.

### Acceptance: Honoring All Three Speeds

Acceptance, then, means: **I honor that my mind, my emotions, and my body all process at different speeds. I give each level the time it needs.**

When I have an insight, I celebrate it. But I also recognize: it will take time for this to move into my emotions. It will take even more time for it to move into my body.

**I don't judge myself for the time it takes. I accept the process.**

I accept that my body is slow. I accept that my emotions are slower than my thoughts. **I accept that integration is a PROCESS, not an event.**

### Accepting the Body: The Hardest Part

For most people on a spiritual path, **accepting the body is the hardest part**.

We've been conditioned to see the body as lesser, as base, as something to overcome. We want to be all spirit, all light, all high vibration.

But the body is where the WORK happens. **The body is where consciousness becomes REAL.**

An idea in your mind is just potential. An idea integrated into your body—into your actions, your posture, your nervous system, your habits—**that's TRANSFORMATION.**

Spiritual insights are beautiful, but they're not enough. **The question is: Can you bring that insight all the way down into the ice? Can you embody it?**

### The Task: Accept All Three Levels

The task for today is simple but profound: **Accept all three levels of yourself.**

**Accept your mind/spirit:** the part of you that understands quickly, that has insights, that connects to high consciousness. Don't dismiss this as "just intellectual" or "not real." Honor it.

**Accept your soul/emotions:** the part of you that feels, that flows, that processes more slowly than thought. Don't judge yourself for having emotions that don't match your understanding yet. Honor the time it takes.

**Accept your body:** the part of you that is slow, that is dense, that carries history, that needs time to change. Don't hate your body for not keeping up with your mind. Honor the body as the sacred vessel.

Write it down if it helps:
- "I accept my mind, which processes quickly."
- "I accept my emotions, which process at medium speed."
- "I accept my body, which processes slowly."
- "I accept that all three are me, and all three are necessary."

## Practice

### Preparation

We start, as always, by caressing my body, massaging my body, allowing myself to thank my physical body for being the anchor of my spirit in the matter.

Focus very deep on my breathing. Feel how the air, the oxygen, starts to come through my nose, going to my lungs, my heart, my blood, my organs, my muscles.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Toroid

1. **Feel the heat expanding.** Allow myself to feel the heat within my body, how it starts to go out through my skin, filling up my aura, all my magnetical field.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Think about the I Am as a light over my head. With each breathing, bring all the heat, all the energy around my body, towards the I Am, the higher self, as a spiral, feeding the light, making it brighter and brighter and brighter.

3. **Descend through all chakras.** Allow myself to bring the light of the I Am through all my body. Take a deep breath: third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacrum, root, knees, ankles, feet.

4. **Light the entire field.** Feel the light of the I Am within my body, taking all the information from the mind we have worked with all these 10 days. Feel the I Am touching all that information—in every cell, every chakra, every level.

5. **Accept all levels.** Recognize: I am mind, spirit, high vibration—fast, clear, insightful. I accept this. I am soul, emotion, medium vibration—flowing, feeling, processing. I accept this. I am body, matter, low vibration—slow, dense, sacred vessel. I accept this.

6. **Integrate the trinity.** All three are me. All three are necessary. All three are holy. I stop trying to be only spirit. I stop devaluing the body. I accept all three levels with equal reverence.

7. **Feel the toroid expand.** From my center, the energy starts to expand in all directions—above my head, below my feet, all around my body as an egg of light, as a toroid field. This is the integration of all my parts.

8. **Pronounce the vibration.** Take a deep breath. Start to make the sound, the vibration that comes from my body towards all the directions, towards the eternity of my being: **Nh... Nh... Nh... Nh...**

9. **Declare the statement.** Take a deep breath. Saying it towards all the directions, the eternity of myself: "I am the Emissary of Eternity. I am the Emissary of Eternity. I am the Emissary of Eternity."

### Closing

Take a deep breath. We take our hands to our hearts. Recognize: "I am not just spirit trying to escape the body. I am not just body disconnected from spirit. I am the integration—mind, soul, and body as one. I accept all levels. I honor all speeds. I am the Emissary of Eternity."

Take the consciousness with my hands to every part of my body. Stretching, caressing, massaging, yawning, we come back and gently open my eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write or contemplate:

**I accept my mind/spirit:** (How does your mind work? What are its gifts? Its challenges?)

**I accept my soul/emotions:** (How do your emotions move? What do they teach you? Where do they lag behind your understanding?)

**I accept my body:** (How does your body process experience? What is it still working on? What does it need?)

Then write:
**"I accept that all three levels process at different speeds, and I give each the time it needs."**

Notice: Where have you been trying to force your body to keep up with your mind? Where have you been judging your emotions for not matching your intellectual understanding?

Give yourself permission for the slow integration. **The body is not failing you by being slow. The body is doing exactly what it's designed to do.**

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice which level you're operating from:

When you have a sudden insight or understanding—that's your mind/spirit level. Fast, clear, brilliant. Celebrate it. And also recognize: this hasn't integrated into your emotions or body yet. Give it time.

When you feel an emotion that doesn't match your intellectual understanding—that's your soul level processing at its own speed. Don't judge it. Feel it. Let it move through. It's doing the work of integration.

When your body resists a change you've mentally decided on, or when a physical pattern persists despite your best intentions—that's your body processing at body speed. Don't hate it. Work WITH it. Ask what it needs. Give it the time and support to integrate.

**Integration is complete when all three levels align:** when you understand it (mind), feel it (soul), and embody it (body). That might take an instant for small things and years for big things. Accept the timeline.

Also notice: Are you trying to "transcend" your body? Are you living primarily in your head? Are you valuing spirit over matter? That's spiritual bypassing. Come back down. Honor the ice as much as the steam.

## Q&A

### Q: If body, soul, and spirit are just different vibration speeds, why does it feel like they're separate?

Because you're experiencing them AS separate. Your conscious awareness is usually focused on one level at a time. You're "in your head" (spirit level) or "in your feelings" (soul level) or "in your body" (body level). But they're always all operating simultaneously—you just aren't always aware of all three at once. Integration happens when you can hold awareness of all three levels simultaneously.

### Q: How do I know which level I'm primarily operating from?

Notice your focus. If you're thinking, analyzing, understanding—you're in mind/spirit. If you're feeling, flowing with emotion, sensing mood—you're in soul. If you're sensing physical sensations, moving, aware of your body's state—you're in body. Most people have a default level they live in and other levels they're disconnected from. Spiritual seekers often live in mind/spirit and are disconnected from body.

### Q: What's the practical difference between "accepting" that my body is slow and just being patient?

Acceptance isn't passive waiting. Acceptance is active honoring. It's working WITH your body's pace, not against it. Patience can have an undercurrent of "hurry up already," which is still resistance. Acceptance says, "This is the right speed. This is how it works. I'm not tolerating slowness; I'm honoring the design."

### Q: I've had trauma. My body holds things my mind knows aren't true anymore. Is that the body being "slow"?

Yes, exactly. Your mind might know intellectually that you're safe now, but your body (nervous system, tissue, cellular memory) is still processing the old threat. That's not the body failing—that's the body doing the deep, slow work of integration. You can't think your way out of trauma. You have to let the body process it at body speed, usually with somatic work, movement, touch, time.

### Q: How do I stop spiritual bypassing if I'm already doing it?

Start paying attention to your body. Make body work as important as meditation. Move. Dance. Do somatic practices. Get massage. Feel your feet on the ground. Notice when you're using spiritual concepts to avoid difficult emotions or physical realities. The litmus test: Are you using spirituality to transcend and escape, or to integrate and embody? One takes you up and out. One brings you down and in.

### Q: What if my body is sick or disabled? Does that mean I'm "low vibration"?

No. "Low vibration" in this context doesn't mean bad or less-than. It means DENSE, SLOW, PHYSICAL. All bodies are "low vibration" compared to pure spirit—that's what makes them bodies. A sick body, a disabled body, an old body, a young body—all are the same "vibration level" in this model. The body is the body. The teaching isn't about judging bodies as good or bad; it's about accepting that the BODY LEVEL (all bodies) processes slowly compared to mind.

### Q: If integration takes so long, am I ever going to be "fully integrated"?

Integration is ongoing, not a destination. As long as you're alive, you're receiving new experiences that need to be integrated down through all three levels. The goal isn't to reach some final state of "done." The goal is to HONOR THE PROCESS and stop expecting instant integration. You can become skilled at integration—it gets faster with practice—but it's a lifelong practice, not a one-time achievement.

### Q: How does this relate to the toroid chakra?

The toroid is the FIELD created when all the chakras (all the levels) are working together. When body, soul, and spirit are all accepted and aligned, the toroid field is strong, coherent, unified. When you're fragmented—living only in your head, disconnected from body, suppressing emotion—the toroid field is weak, incoherent, fragmented. The toroid represents integration itself, the wholeness of the trinity functioning as one.

**Completion Note:**  
This completes the 10-day cycle and the Mental Week of Virgo in the root chakra. You've done the work of the mind: analyzing, listing, organizing, understanding. You've looked at qualities, truths, utility, attachments, creations, attributes, advance, destination, and acceptance.

Take a day to rest, to integrate, to let your body and emotions catch up with everything your mind has understood. The slow processing is beginning. Honor it.

Well done. The Emissary of Eternity bows to the Emissary of Eternity.
