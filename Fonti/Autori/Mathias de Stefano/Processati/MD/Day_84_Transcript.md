## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? I will do the video like this today because today we 've been filming something with Gain and it 's a mess right now , my room. It was done like a setting or a setting or a filming.

So it is all a cast and they are arranging it.

So I decided to come here because otherwise I would n't have the time.

So I hope you can hear me and that you can see me and adopting , changing.

So please let me know if you hear any noises or something because there is a party , there is noise everywhere and I do n't know if you can hear me well.

Today there was no reason why they should give me another room.

So that 's why I am in regard.

So anyway , as opposed to today , it says we have to save and sometimes we lose. I will try to be connected because there is some of the people that came for this week , for the trip this week.

So and they found me.

So here we are. I will try to focus in the concept for today.

So the topic for today which is saving and when we are working is the process of how the hard means straight from the blood.

So this is why the heart is more related in physical with the economy than with emotions. Economy that we have said comes from the Greek word , Cos Names , that means the order of the home.

So to put order in the house in the home is to be able to initiate your capacity of having food , of having all the things that you need in order to leave. This is why in the house we also relate the kitchen with the heart because it 's a place where you made the food in order for the family to leave.

So it is the same thing that the heart in the physical body is also doing. The body is administrated the blood for all the family that are the origins. And to understand what save means to save things , goods in nature is not the same concept that we socially have the saving. We think that save is to accumulate things , goods so we can survive.

But what we are really doing is if we want to really do what the nature does to save is not to keep the things for yourself and to do things in the correct way because imagine if the heart would accumulate blood.

So suddenly basically you die , you have a heart attack. The nature where it does by saving is administration the energy and to put the things in the right place where they belong. The nature and everything that exists exists because of saving and the nature saves energy all the time. It 's constantly saving all the time energy.

The reason why everything exists is because of atoms. And atoms exist because they have an energy that if they do n't join with other particles , they are wasting this energy.

So they need for other particles with other energy to attach to each other.

So they can save their energy.

So by sharing their own energy , they are saving it.

So imagine that if a particle in the reality , in the creation , a particle wants to save energy for itself.

So all the particles would be by alone , by separate.

So nothing would exist.

So in the only way they can exist is by sharing this information.

So the only reason why everything exists is because everything is. . .

So this is why the concept of saving is the one that allows everything to exist.

So the concept of saving things , saving energy comes from the word Salvage. And Salvage means to take care of things , to protect things.

So to protect the things would be not to accumulate them , but to take good care of the things. In Spanish , we have this word that is our rar. And our rar comes from the Arabic word that is al-Hur. That means to set free someone free.

The concepts of protect what you have , the protection of what you have , and the concept of setting someone free , are the concepts that we have to be able to save goods. If someone has to survive without depending on others , okay? The concept of saving is something natural that we all do by existence , our biology does this.

So it 's something natural that we need.

So the basic nature of saving , to understand that what we have to do , that what we are doing by protecting what we accomplish by being free , is acknowledging that by the concept of sustainability of the own sustainability of your own life , you are able to survive by yourself , but also you recognize that you need the others to , to you need the others in order to survive long.

So of course that in the spiritual realms , in the energetic worlds , in other dimensions , does n't exist this concept of saving the energy or the goods. It does n't really exist , but when we are it , we need to understand that we have to protect that energy in order to survive. This is why it 's so biological. When you are in this reality , you need to know how to protect your own energy in order to have order inside yourself.

Of spent goods , it 's totally the opposite of for us today , it 's totally the opposite to save.

So if saving would be to storage , to keep information , to keep goods for yourself , to fill up places that were void before.

So the idea of wasting , no , standing , sorry.

So the idea of spending would be to spaces free.

So places that you depend on in Latin , that means to leave the things away , to throw the things away. But there 's another word in English that comes exactly from vacuum , the word vacate , that means that in English you may say waste. Waste , which is something that you throw away , the waste of money , for example , the waste of goods , is also a way you would say to have the vacuum , to have a void. And there is nothing there to feel a space.

If atoms are earning energy , and they are saving energy by joining each other , creating a molecule , and the molecules , save energy by creating chemical elements and so on.

So they create rigid structures , very static structures , to save the energy. But when one of those molecules or atoms , they lost , they lose energy.

So the structure is lost , so it changes. It 's an chemical element in a different reality. But what we usually , by consciousness , we think that transformation is something really good , because you are able to become yourself in a different thing.

So the same thing happened with the structure with matter.

So when you have matter , molecule that is wasting energy , this structure that was static , that does n't change at all , now by wasting the energy , is able to transform in a different thing.

So transformation is something good , because it 's allowing yourself to become something new , something different , basically to waste also something.

So basically what the concepts of earn and waste , the concept of spend and save energy , is basically the idea is that when you earn or you save a lot of energy constantly , you are a structure. You become rigid , you become static.

So something that is not that constant , so what you have to do , if you want to transform yourself , to change yourself , is to give energy away , to leave some of the energy that you have to spend the energy that you have.

So you can give , post this new , transform yourself to your life.

So for example , all of us in our life have been willing to make , for example , a trip in our life to do something different.

So what we have to do is to pay this energy that you 're putting , this emotions that you 're putting , you are living a lot of things behind your wasting , you are spending a lot of your energy in order to allow yourself to move into a different reality , to have a different experience , to allow yourself to bring new things.

So to transform yourself , we usually do this in many ways of our life , by living in relations with people , by just paying things , by doing trips , by reading a new book.

So all these different examples are going outside from our comfort zone , and to start kind of a crisis in order to allow yourself to experience a new thing.

So that 's the goal of wasting and spending.

So the important thing to understand of this , is that spending and saving is a cycle. It 's about if you spend , you lose , and if you save , you earn. It 's not that. Basically , if you do n't lose something , and that you do n't give away something that you do n't need anymore , you are not going to give space for something new to come in your life.

So wasting something , spending something gives you the opportunity to give a place , a vac for something new. And that something new is the one that will set you free , and that will take care of you. It 's a saving.

So it 's a cycle , a constant cycle that we need to go through in order to exist.

So basically this works like the heart , by the heartbeat. You receive blood from one side , boom , and then , boom. And then , the other side , you push it away.

So the heart would n't be able to do this circuit if it would storage the blood inside.

Okay.

So what you need to do is to allow always a free space within you , something missing within you.

So you are able to receive something new. If you are full , if you have everything in your body , your mind is full , you 're not going to be able to receive anything new.

So I do n't want this to sound like an explanation of the law of attraction. No , I 'm explain this about energy , not about money. I 'm explain this about the concept of that you have this energy in your mind , in your emotion , and in your body.

Okay.

So in the three different levels , we would say , for example , that if you do n't have a free space in your mind , in your beliefs , you are not going to be able to receive new thoughts , new ideas. You will be stuck in your patterns , in your patterns of belief.

So you are stuck in a way of thinking , and the same way with emotions. If you think , no , this is all the people I loved , and I do n't want to love anyone else , and I just want to keep them for myself. You are not living someone behind in order to receive a new people , other ones gave to you.

So you always need to leave something behind , so you can receive something new. In the physical way , also talking about goods , about money , or whatever , in the physical way , you are not living and spending some of the energy of the physical energy. And you want just to keep all the things because you are a thread of losing , you are the thread of not having in order to survive.

So you are not opening yourself to receive new things , maybe they are just focused in just what you have , thinking that if you lose it , you do n't have anything.

So this is how the cycle works in the three levels of consciousness , not only in matter.

So this is the concept that we have to have , that everything that we see exists because the atoms are saving energy. But the diversity that exists is only possible because the atoms allow themselves also to lose energy.

## Daily Practice Elements

So written in the blog , and if you do n't understand the blog , so maybe in 15 years you will , let 's go to the alignment , then I had n't read the information. The vibration for today is she. The statement for today is I accept the evolution. The code for today is the duodecated , duodecated , which is the group of 12.

The last concept of creation is the creation of the final grade of Trinity , the 12 concepts that constitute the grade spectre of the initiative path of everything created , the code of 12 that represents the order of Charts , 12 nodes , 12 basic geometries , 12 laws , etc.

So if the information , if the video cuts or whatever , you all know already how to do this alignment is very easy.

So just the attention to every one of the joints , moving the whole body to allow the energy to flow around. Then you go up , bring the energy of the I am towards the heart , say the vibration , then you just say the burns the vibration , then you say the stay today , and then just bring all the energy around the body.

So we begin by stretching the body , warning , messaging until I start to relax the body , sitting or laying in a comfortable position , and I just focus in the breathing. I pay attention to my left foot. I start to move my toes , the foot and soft in the ankle , and I go to the hip , moving the entire leg. I start to move the body from the waist towards the left , feeling the pressure in the waist , until I come back to the center.

I start to move my fingers in the left hand , and the wrist , in circles , as I go up , to the elbow , and then the shoulder. And I begin to move my head in circles towards the left. I stop , and I begin to turn this time to the right. I begin to move my head towards the right , and then the hand movements towards the right shoulder , towards the right elbow , and the wrist , in circles , until the fingers of the right hand.

## Energy Work

I turn , I bend my body towards the right , feeling the pressure in the waist , and I descend towards the right hip with my right leg. I move the right knee , and I bring the movement with softly circles in the ankle , and the right foot , until the toes. I relax the body , I relax , and I bring my attention above my body , to take a deep breath , and bring the light and the presence of the eye , and through the crown , the third eye , the throat , and the ring in your heart. I take my hands towards my chest , and with the tip of the fingers , the one you point , you use to point , and the heart , you start to make a massage to all your chests , and the stern.

Now , feeling the pressure , I start to massage my chest from the stern , up and down , down , and up , doing pressure from the center to the outside , like feeling if you are opening your chest in half. I take a deep breath , and perceive the light of the eye , and expanding through your chest throughout all this stern. I relax my hands , and allow myself to perceive , and softly I start to violate , setting the intention to manifest the balance between my gif and receive. I take my hands towards my chest , and I bring my attention above my body , to take a deep breath , and I bring my attention above my body , to take a deep breath , and I bring my attention above my body.

I am centered , evolution. I am centered , evolution. I take a deep breath , and through the movement of your body , start to bring all this consciousness , through all the joints , and the portals you opened in them around your body. I 'm stretching , messaging , and moving.

I 'm stretching one at its long time , and I come back here , and now I 'm opening my eyes. Thank you all for being there every day. As always , see you tomorrow at the same time for the plexus. Drink a little water.
