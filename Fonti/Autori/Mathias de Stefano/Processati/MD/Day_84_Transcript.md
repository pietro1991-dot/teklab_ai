# Day 84 - Saving and Losing

## Overview

Today explores saving and losing through the heart—not emotional heart, but physical heart regulating blood. Heart relates more to economy than emotions in physical sense.

Economy comes from Greek oikos + nomos = order of the home. Putting order in house/home means initiating your capacity to have food, all things you need to live. In house, we relate kitchen with heart because it's where you make food for family to live. Same thing physical heart does—administrates blood for all family (organs).

To understand saving, we must distinguish nature's concept from social concept. We think save means accumulate goods to survive. But what nature does by saving is administering energy and putting things in right place where they belong.

Imagine if heart accumulated blood—heart attack, death. Nature saves by sharing. Everything exists because of atoms. Atoms exist because they have energy that, if they don't join with other particles, they waste energy. So they attach to each other to save energy. By sharing their energy, they save it.

If particles wanted to save energy for themselves, all particles would be separate. Nothing would exist. Only reason everything exists is because everything shares. Saving is what allows everything to exist.

## Core Teaching

### Economy: Order of the Home

Economy (Greek: oikos + nomos) means order of the home. The heart creates this order by administering blood to all organs (family).

In nature, saving is not accumulation but administration—putting energy in right place where it belongs. The concept of saving things comes from word salvage: to take care of things, protect things. Protection isn't accumulation but taking good care.

In Spanish, ahorrar (to save) comes from Arabic al-hur: to set free. The concepts of protecting what you have and setting someone free are concepts we need to save goods. Someone must survive without depending on others.

Saving is natural—our biology does this. But we need to understand: what we do by protecting what we accomplish, by being free, is acknowledging own sustainability of your life. You're able to survive by yourself, but you recognize you need others to survive long.

### Atoms Save Energy by Sharing

The only reason everything exists is because atoms save energy by joining together. If atom wants to save energy for itself, that particle would be alone. Nothing would exist. Everything exists because everything shares information.

Atoms are earning energy and saving energy by joining each other, creating molecules. Molecules save energy by creating chemical elements. They create rigid structures, very static structures, to save energy.

But when one of those molecules or atoms loses energy, structure is lost, so it changes. It's chemical element in different reality. What we, by consciousness, think is that transformation is something good because you're able to become different thing.

Same with matter. When you have molecule wasting energy, structure that was static now, by wasting energy, is able to transform into different thing. Transformation is good because it's allowing yourself to become something new, different. To transform, you must also waste something.

### Spending Creates Transformation

Spending (dispendere) means to throw things away. Waste comes from vacuum—to have void, nothing there to feel space.

Concept of earn and waste, spend and save energy: when you earn or save a lot of energy constantly, you are structure. You become rigid, static. If you want to transform yourself, change yourself, you must give energy away, leave some energy you have, spend energy you have. You can give space for new, transform yourself, transform your life.

For example: all of us in our life have wanted to make trip, do something different. What we have to do is pay energy, emotions—leave lot of things behind, waste, spend lot of energy. To allow yourself to move into different reality, have different experience, allow yourself to bring new things.

We transform ourselves many ways in life: leaving relations with people, paying things, doing trips, reading new book. These different examples are going outside comfort zone, starting kind of crisis to allow yourself to experience new thing. That's goal of wasting and spending.

### The Cycle: Heartbeat Rhythm

Important thing to understand: spending and saving is cycle. It's not "if you spend, you lose; if you save, you earn."

Basically, if you don't lose something, if you don't give away something you don't need anymore, you're not going to give space for something new to come in your life. Wasting something, spending something gives you opportunity to give place, vacuum for something new. And that something new is one that will set you free, will take care of you—that's saving.

It's cycle, constant cycle we need to go through to exist. This works like heart, by heartbeat. You receive blood from one side (boom), then boom, other side you push it away.

Heart wouldn't be able to do this circuit if it would storage blood inside. What you need is to allow always free space within you, something missing within you, so you're able to receive something new.

If you're full, if you have everything in body, mind is full, you're not going to be able to receive anything new.

### Three Levels: Mind, Emotion, Body

This is about energy, not just money. About energy in your mind, emotion, body. Three different levels.

Mind: If you don't have free space in mind, in beliefs, you're not going to be able to receive new thoughts, ideas. You'll be stuck in your patterns of belief, stuck in way of thinking.

Emotions: Same way with emotions. If you think "these are all people I loved, I don't want to love anyone else, just want to keep them for myself," you're not leaving someone behind to receive new people, other ones given to you. You always need to leave something behind to receive something new.

Physical (goods, money): If you're not leaving and spending some physical energy, you want just to keep all things because you're afraid of losing, afraid of not having to survive, you're not opening yourself to receive new things. You're just focused on what you have, thinking if you lose it, you don't have anything.

Cycle works in three levels of consciousness, not only in matter.

## Practice: Heart Activation

**Preparation:**
- Sit or lie comfortably
- Stretch, massage, warm body
- Focus on breathing, let weight fall

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation sequence (left foot → head → right foot)

**Heart Chakra Work:**

19. Bring attention above body
20. Take deep breath, bring light/presence of I Am through crown, third eye, throat, anchoring in heart
21. Take hands toward chest
22. With fingertips (pointing and heart fingers), massage all chest and sternum
23. Feel pressure, massage chest from sternum up and down, down and up
24. Do pressure from center to outside—like opening chest in half
25. Perceive light of I Am expanding through chest throughout all sternum

**Integration:**

26. Relax hands, allow yourself perceive
27. Softly start vibrating, setting intention to manifest balance between give and receive
28. Vibrate: SSfam
29. State: "I am centered evolution" (repeat)
30. Through movement of body, bring all consciousness through all joints/portals opened
31. Stretch, massage, move
32. Return here now, open eyes

**Closing:** Thank for being present. Drink water to assimilate.

## Key Insights

1. Economy means "order of home"—heart administers blood like kitchen provides food
2. Nature saves by administering energy and putting things where they belong
3. Salvage (saving) means protecting things, not accumulating them
4. Atoms save energy by joining with other particles—sharing IS saving
5. If particles saved alone, nothing would exist—sharing creates all existence
6. Rigid structure (saved energy) must waste energy to transform
7. Spending creates vacuum/space for new things to enter
8. Saving and spending is cycle, not either/or choice
9. Heart wouldn't work if it stored blood—must receive and push away
10. You must leave something behind to receive something new
11. Being "full" in mind, emotions, or body blocks receiving
12. Cycle works in three levels: mind (beliefs), emotions (relationships), body (goods)
13. Transformation requires crisis—leaving comfort zone to experience new
14. Free space within you is necessity, not emptiness
15. Sustainability comes from knowing you can survive alone but need others for long term

## Integration

**Daily:** Before accumulating (information, possessions, relationships), ask: "Am I saving this or hoarding it? Is this creating order or blocking flow?"

**Weekly:** Heart chakra practice opening chest "in half." Feel balance between receiving blood and pushing blood—constant rhythm, not storage.

**Monthly:** Identify one area where you're "full" (beliefs, relationships, possessions). What can you leave behind to create space for new?

**Ongoing:** Notice heartbeat rhythm throughout day. Each beat is receive/give cycle. Let it remind you: transformation requires both saving and spending.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: How is saving different from accumulating?**
A: Saving is putting energy where it belongs, administering it properly. Accumulating is storing out of fear, blocking flow. Heart saves blood by circulating it, not storing it.

**Q: If atoms save by sharing, why do we fear losing?**
A: Because we think survival means keeping everything for ourselves. But atoms prove opposite: they survive by joining others. Sharing energy is how they (and we) save it.

**Q: Isn't spending the same as wasting?**
A: Spending (dispendere) and waste (vacuum) both create space for new. But spending is intentional transformation; wasting can be unconscious. Both serve transformation when conscious.

**Q: How do I know what to leave behind?**
A: What no longer transforms you. Rigid structures that were stable now block change. Feel where you're stuck (mind, emotions, body)—that's what needs releasing to allow new.

**Q: Does this mean I shouldn't save money?**
A: No. This is about energy cycle, not reckless spending. Save (administer properly, put where belongs), but don't accumulate out of fear. Money must circulate like blood to create health.

**Q: How can I be "full" if void is fullness?**
A: Different contexts. Void (silence) is fullness unexpressed—potential. Being "full" here means blocked, no space for new. One is openness to all; other is closure to change.

**Q: What if I need stability, not constant change?**
A: Heartbeat is stable rhythm of change—receive, give, receive, give. Stability comes from consistent cycle, not from stopping flow. Change is how you maintain stability.

**Q: How does this relate to economy in society?**
A: Society's economy should mirror body's economy—administration and circulation creating order, not accumulation creating blockage. Heart attack happens to bodies and societies that hoard instead of circulate.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching reveals saving and losing as complementary rhythm, not opposing forces. Your heart demonstrates truth: receive blood, push blood away, receive, push. If heart stored blood (saving without spending), you'd die. If heart only pumped out (spending without saving), you'd die. Life is the cycle.

Atoms save energy by joining others—ultimate proof that sharing is saving, not losing. When you hold tight to everything (beliefs, relationships, possessions), you become rigid structure unable to transform. When you release what no longer serves, you create vacuum for something new to fill.

Your heart administers blood to all organs, creating order of home. That's economy: not accumulation, but administration. Not hoarding, but circulating. Not fearing loss, but trusting rhythm.

Remember: if you're full (no space within), you cannot receive new. Something must leave to create vacuum. This isn't loss—it's transformation. This is how evolution happens at every level: mind releasing old beliefs, emotions releasing old bonds, body releasing old forms.

You are centered evolution when you honor the heartbeat—boom (receive), boom (give). That's the cycle keeping you alive. That's saving and losing as one dance.
