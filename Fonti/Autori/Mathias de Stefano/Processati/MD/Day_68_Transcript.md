## Overview

Today we arrive at the eighth pair in the Libra balancing series: **matrix and patterns.** We're working with the knees, the part of the body that allows us to kneel, to bow, to humble ourselves before the greater patterns that shape reality.

In modern spirituality, these two words have become loaded with negative connotations. We hear: "Break your patterns! Escape the matrix! You're trapped in conditioning!" The underlying message is that patterns and matrix are **prisons** we must free ourselves from.

But this teaching, like all the Libra teachings, reveals the deeper truth:

**Patterns are not prisons—they are protection tools.** The word "pattern" comes from the Latin *pater*, meaning **"father, protector"**—the one who keeps the tribe safe, who ensures survival.

**Matrix is not a cage—it's a network.** The matrix is the vast dimensional network that stores all information, all possibilities, all evolutionary data across time and space.

The revolutionary insight: **Patterns and matrix are not your enemies. They're tools. The question is not "How do I escape them?" but "How do I use them consciously?"**

Here's how they work together:

- **Patterns** = individual strings, paths, tools you use to accomplish purposes (WILL)
- **Matrix** = the network made of all patterns together, the eternal energy field (LOVE)
- **Wisdom** = understanding the purpose of both, knowing why they exist and how to use them consciously

When you don't understand patterns, they control you—you repeat unconsciously, stuck in survival programming.

When you don't understand matrix, it feels like a cage—you feel trapped in forces beyond your control.

But **when you understand both consciously, you realize: You are creating your own matrix with the patterns you choose. You are not trapped—you are the creator.**

The teaching doesn't say "destroy all patterns" or "escape the matrix." It says:

**"Acknowledge each pattern. Understand its purpose. Use it as a tool. Create your matrix consciously instead of unconsciously inheriting one."**

This is liberation—not freedom FROM patterns and matrix, but freedom WITHIN them, **freedom as the conscious creator of your reality.**

---

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology of Pattern

Let's start with the wisdom hidden in the word itself.

**Pattern** comes from the Latin *pater* and European languages' *pattern*, which means **"father"** and comes from the root meaning **"to protect."**

Why is "pattern" related to "father"?

**In the origin of our tribes and families, the male who was taking care of the kids, protecting the group, protecting the family and tribe, was called the *pattern*—the one protecting the group.**

That's how the idea of father comes from.

**So pattern literally means: something that helps you survive, that puts everything together in order to help you be safe.**

### Why We Call Them Patterns Today

Throughout the history of humanity, all those things we do that try to:
- Protect us
- Make us feel safe
- Allow us to survive
- Help us keep living

Are the things that are protecting us. **So through our history, we do things in order to protect ourselves and our people, our tribes.**

When some of those tools are good—when they accomplish their mission of protecting us—**we repeat them.** Because if it worked, it accomplished its goal, so we do it again and again.

**That's what we call a pattern: something that through time is still protecting you.**

You constantly repeat it, whether you're an individual or a group, because **it keeps you safe.**

### When Patterns Become Problems

So when is the moment when you say, **"I need to clean the patterns, I don't want these patterns, I need to get rid of these patterns"?**

It happens in the moment when you realize:

**I need to keep going. I need to transform myself. I need to change my life. I need to feel free.**

And sadly, **the pattern starts to keep you constantly protected.**

The pattern was trying to protect you, and now you're trying to go into a non-protected zone, something very different. You won't be able to be protected in the old way.

**So the pattern is trying to protect you constantly, but you are willing to go into an unprotected area.**

This is how a pattern holds you back and doesn't allow you to move forward.

**The idea of a pattern holding you back is natural when you're trying to move forward.**

### You Can't Get Rid of Patterns

Here's the problem with trying to "get rid" of patterns:

**You cannot get rid of a pattern because patterns are good and useful for certain situations.**

Remember: patterns were created for certain moments when you needed them.

**It's like trying to get rid of knowledge that you have. It's not possible to get rid of something you already know, because that knowledge is useful for specific moments.**

### Re-Educating Patterns

**What we really can do is re-educate the pattern—do it in a different way, prove that you can do it differently.**

Example: Every Sunday, your family gets together to eat meat. It's normal for the family to constantly eat meat. How do you change this pattern?

**Step-by-step re-education:**

1. First, try yourself to change—eat with them, they eat meat, but you eat something cooked the same way (like seitan, for example)
2. You eat that as if it is meat, with all of them
3. They will start softly to wonder, "How do you like it?"
4. Suddenly they will start to change into seitan
5. Until there is only one remaining eating meat

**It's naturally and step by step—re-education.**

You can have patterns with:
- Family
- Friends
- Partners
- Religion
- Culture
- Anything

This was just a simple example of **how you re-educate a pattern step by step.**

### What Is the Matrix?

Now, on the other hand, we have **the matrix.**

**Matrix cannot be re-educated, because matrix incorporates everything.**

Everything is there. All information is there. So it's impossible to change it in the way you change a pattern.

We usually think that matrix is something like a prison because **matrix incorporates all information in the network through every time and every space.**

**We could say that matrix is the information that made us be what we are.**

We are controlled by the patterns of the matrix—this is why we sometimes think we are prisoners of this matrix.

### Matrix Exists in All Dimensions

**Matrix is not something that exists only in the third dimension, related with some people on earth.**

**It's something that exists across dimensions.** It's like a **network of vibration that stores all information through the whole cosmos.**

**The matrix is something we could say is like the subconscious that keeps us being what we are, even if we don't want to be what we are.**

### How Matrix and Patterns Work Together

These two concepts that seem opposite are doing exactly the same with us:

**Conditioning us to be what we are.**

How?

- **Patterns** show us **how** and **where** we have to do it
- **Matrix** is saying **you cannot do anything else but that**

**The mix of these two concepts:**

**The matrix is like a tissue made up with many strings. And each one of those strings or paths is a pattern.**

**A matrix is made of thousands and billions of patterns.**

**Each one of these patterns is creating the idea of matrix.**

### Creating Your Own Matrix

Here's the revolutionary insight:

**If we acknowledge each one of the patterns we have and we start to be aware of how to use each one of these patterns, we will be able to create our own matrix—to handle our matrix.**

**The reason why we allow the matrix to control us is because we don't know how to use the patterns.**

**When we start to acknowledge how to use the patterns as a tool, we start to realize that we are able to create the matrix.**

**Matrix is not anymore a jail for the self—it's our creation.**

### Limitations Show How to Transcend

**A civilization aware of its own limitations is a civilization able to know how to transcend them.**

**People who don't know what their own limitations are cannot know how to transcend them.**

**This is why patterns are the indicators that show us how we create our own reality.**

### Patterns Are Will, Matrix Is Love

Now we go deeper into the energetic relationship:

**Patterns are the energy that moves you forward into one action.**

It's what we call **will.** Patterns push you to will.

**We have different goals and objectives, and the network—the matrix—is holding all the will and giving the energy to each one of the patterns to accomplish its own will.**

**It's eternal energy that we call love.**

So:
- **Pattern = Will**
- **Matrix = Love**

### When We Don't Recognize Love in the Matrix

**When we don't recognize the love in the matrix, the matrix starts to become like a cage.**

And this cage is made with all the emotions possible.

**We feel like we are trapped in a world of emotions.**

### When We Don't Recognize Our Patterns

**When we don't recognize our patterns, instead of pushing us forward to accomplish our missions, the patterns move us into the generation they want.**

**This is how we are conditioned by our patterns in life.**

### The Third Element: Wisdom

**We need a third element that helps us understand these two—what is the goal, what is the purpose of the pattern, what is the purpose of the matrix.**

**In the middle we find wisdom.**

**Wisdom is what gives the meaning and purpose to both of them.**

**I awaken wisdom in the moment when through love I activate the will to accomplish a purpose.**

**Wisdom represents:**
- The acknowledging of why I have this pattern
- The main idea of why I live in this matrix

### The Real Work

**Instead of trying to get rid of the pattern and trying to escape the matrix, what we have to do is understand why they exist—why they exist in my life.**

When I am able to answer myself, or to make the questions to myself—**why, what for, from where**—that's when we start to acknowledge and awaken the wisdom of the patterns and the matrix.

**This is the task we have throughout our whole life.**

### Why They're Important

**Patterns and matrix are the ones creating our history: from the past, the present, and the future.**

### The Matrix Is What We Upload

Important clarification:

**The matrix that everyone is blaming for holding us trapped and controlled is like that because we have charged the matrix with the system of control, hierarchy, domination.**

**The matrix is just absorbing systems and information.**

**The system of matrix will be exactly as we upload information to it.**

If we keep creating the idea that "the matrix is controlling us" and "there's something from the outside trying to make us slaves," we are just **putting that information in the matrix.**

**The matrix is just a system of networks absorbing data.**

If we put fear and control data into it, the matrix will always be the same.

Example: **Picture that the matrix is like the internet.** In that internet, everyone is uploading information about fear and control. Then you go to Google and look for information about trees, and suddenly you find "trees are controlling the grass, trees are grabbing the rocks and struggling."

Whatever we look for, we will filter it through the lens of fear.

**Let's begin to charge new information into the matrix. Otherwise, it will be the same.**

### How This Integrates with Libra

From eight days of balancing, we see:

**Day 61 - Eternal/Finite:** Patterns are finite tools. Matrix is the eternal network.

**Day 62 - Light/Darkness:** Patterns are the light (conscious tools). Matrix is the darkness (the vast field holding all possibilities).

**Day 63 - Truth/Lies:** Patterns are truth (verified strategies). Matrix is "lie" (the creative field of all possibilities).

**Day 64 - Love/Hate:** Patterns are hate (boundaries, protection). Matrix is love (the infinite field of connection).

**Day 65 - Personality/Essence:** Patterns are personality (specific tools). Matrix is essence (the field from which all emerges).

**Day 66 - Creation/Destruction:** Patterns are creation (specific forms). Matrix is the field where creation-destruction happens.

**Day 67 - Good/Bad:** Patterns are morality (specific values). Matrix is the amoral field holding all possibilities.

**Day 68 - Matrix/Patterns:** The explicit teaching—patterns create matrix, wisdom uses both consciously.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch your legs, especially your knees—bend them, straighten them, feel their flexibility and strength.

The knees allow you to kneel, to bow, to humble yourself. They represent **flexibility within structure, movement within pattern.**

Massage your body. Let the weight fall down. Release tension.

Focus on your breathing. Feel the air coming into your body.

### The Mountain Meditation

Visualize yourself at the edge of a mountain, looking down at the beautiful valley below.

Feel the air from the valley coming up through your body—feet, legs, **knees**, hips, belly, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, head.

Feel yourself in your axis, very still and firm.

### Bringing Light to the Knees

Put your hands toward the sky, feeling the light of the sun.

Perceive the light of the sun coming down across your body:

Crown → Third Eye → Throat → Heart → Solar Plexus → Sacral → Root → and breathing in itself through your **knees.**

Take a deep breath.

### Integration: Matrix in One Hand, Patterns in the Other

Perceive the light coming from your knees toward the palms of your hands.

Feel your hands filling out with this light until you feel heaviness, texture.

**In one hand, you hold the concept of MATRIX.**  
**In the other hand, you hold the concept of PATTERNS.**

Recognize:

**The matrix is a structure that holds what I am.**

**The patterns are the tools that the self is using in order to build what I am.**

### Understanding Their Purpose

Recognize in the matrix: **the eternal love that allows me to transform, to be, to express.**

Recognize in the patterns: **the will that pushes me to accomplish my purpose.**

**Both of them are not here to prohibit me from creating my path. They are here to help me become my own path.**

**I can only understand the purpose of both through the consciousness that gives me wisdom.**

### Unifying Matrix and Patterns

Bring your hands to your heart.

Set the intention to unite:
- The **love** of your matrix
- The **will** of your patterns
- In the **consciousness** of your wisdom

Make the sound:

**SSñú... SSñú... SSñú... SSñú...**

Feel the vibration unifying the two concepts of patterns and matrix as one in your purpose.

### Integration of Eight Days

Now integrate all eight days, from crown to knees:

**Crown - Eternal/Finite:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Third Eye - Light/Darkness:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Throat - Truth/Lies:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Heart - Love/Hate:** Light splits to hands, unite at heart with **SSñú...**

**Solar Plexus - Personality/Essence:** Light splits to hands, unite at solar plexus with **SSñú...**

**Sacral - Creation/Destruction:** Light splits to hands, unite at sacral with **SSñú...**

**Root - Good/Bad:** Light splits to hands, unite at root with **SSñú...**

**Knees - Matrix/Patterns:** Light splits to hands, unite at knees with **SSñú...**

### Closing

Place both hands firmly on your knees.

Take a deep breath and recognize:

**"I Am the Destiny of All Purposes."**

I am my own pattern and my own matrix.

I create the will (patterns) and the love (matrix) that shape my reality.

I use them consciously through wisdom.

Softly, start to bring this consciousness through each part of your body by tracing, stretching, and joining.

Come back here and now, opening your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Mapping Your Patterns:**

Today, identify the main patterns in your life:

**Protective patterns (created for survival/safety):**
- What behaviors do you repeat to feel safe?
- What thought patterns keep you protected?
- What relationship patterns ensure you won't be abandoned/hurt?

**For each pattern, ask:**
1. **Purpose:** Why did I create this pattern? What was it protecting me from?
2. **Usefulness:** Does it still serve that purpose, or has life changed?
3. **Cost:** What does this pattern prevent me from doing/being/experiencing?
4. **Re-education:** If it no longer serves, how can I re-educate it step by step?

### Re-Educating a Pattern

Choose ONE pattern you want to transform. Then:

**Step 1 - Acknowledge:** "I have this pattern. It protected me when [describe situation]."

**Step 2 - Thank:** "Thank you, pattern, for keeping me safe."

**Step 3 - Assess:** "Do I still need this protection, or am I ready to transform?"

**Step 4 - Re-educate gradually:**
- Try one small variation of the pattern
- Keep the protective essence, change the expression
- Prove to yourself you can be safe in a new way
- Gradually expand the new pattern

**Example:**
- Old pattern: "I avoid conflict to stay safe"
- Re-education: "I speak my truth gently in low-stakes situations first"
- Gradually: "I develop skill in conscious conflict, staying safe while being authentic"

### Understanding Your Matrix

**The matrix is the network of all your patterns combined, plus the collective patterns you've absorbed.**

**Examine your matrix:**

**Personal matrix:**
- What core beliefs hold your reality together?
- What "rules" do you unconsciously follow?
- What information have you absorbed that shapes your world?

**Collective matrix:**
- What cultural programming runs in your subconscious?
- What family patterns do you carry unconsciously?
- What societal fears/beliefs have you downloaded?

**Ask:** Is this matrix serving my evolution, or is it a cage?

### Creating Your Matrix Consciously

**The teaching: You are creating your matrix with the patterns you choose.**

**To create consciously:**

1. **Identify unconscious patterns** - What am I doing/thinking/believing automatically?

2. **Choose consciously** - Does this pattern serve my purpose or just old programming?

3. **Re-educate what doesn't serve** - Step by step, change patterns that limit you

4. **Upload new information to the matrix:**
   - Change your beliefs consciously
   - Choose empowering narratives
   - Practice new behaviors
   - Surround yourself with evolved information

5. **Recognize:** Every pattern I consciously choose creates my personal matrix. Every belief I upload to the collective (through action, speech, creation) shapes the collective matrix.

### Wisdom: The Missing Piece

**Pattern (will) + Matrix (love) + Wisdom (consciousness) = Liberation**

**Without wisdom:**
- Patterns control you unconsciously
- Matrix feels like a cage
- You're a victim of conditioning

**With wisdom:**
- You use patterns as tools
- You create your matrix consciously
- You're the creator of your reality

**To develop wisdom, ask:**
- **Why** do I have this pattern?
- **What purpose** does this matrix serve?
- **From where** did this conditioning come?
- **What for** am I using this will?
- **How** does love move through this matrix?

These questions awaken wisdom—the consciousness that gives meaning and purpose to will and love, patterns and matrix.

### Weekly Practice: Uploading New Data to the Matrix

**The matrix is like the internet—it reflects what we upload.**

This week, consciously upload new information:

**Instead of uploading:**
- Fear → Upload courage
- Control → Upload trust
- Victimhood → Upload creative power
- Scarcity → Upload abundance
- Separation → Upload interconnection

**How to upload:**
- Speak new narratives
- Act from new beliefs
- Create from new consciousness
- Share evolved information
- Model transformed patterns

**Remember:** Every time you change a pattern, you're changing the matrix. Every conscious choice ripples through the network.

### Integration: Eight Balanced Pairs

You now have eight pairs integrated:

1. **Eternal/Finite** - Eternal process, finite moments
2. **Light/Darkness** - Presence and absence
3. **Truth/Lies** - Verified and imagined
4. **Love/Hate** - Connection and boundary
5. **Personality/Essence** - Mask and actor
6. **Creation/Destruction** - Gathering and dispersing
7. **Good/Bad** - Human conventions for harmony
8. **Matrix/Patterns** - Network and tools creating reality

Each day, feel all eight pairs in your body, crown to knees, with the sound **SSñú...**

Notice: **You are not trapped in any of these. You are the conscious creator using all of them as tools.**

## Q&A

### Q: If I can't get rid of patterns, how do I ever break free from destructive ones?

**You don't "get rid" of them—you re-educate them step by step.** A destructive pattern was created for protection, even if it's harming you now. Example: "I push people away" was created to protect you from abandonment. Re-education: "I practice vulnerable connection in small, safe ways, proving I can be safe while connected." Keep the protective wisdom (discernment about who to trust), change the expression (from automatic pushing away to conscious choosing).

### Q: How do I know if my pattern needs re-education or if I'm just resisting growth?

**Ask: Is this pattern still serving its original protective purpose, or has life changed?** If the pattern protected you from a danger that no longer exists (childhood abuse, poverty, war) but you're still running it, it needs re-education. If it's protecting you from a current real danger, honor it. The difference: outdated patterns feel rigid, limiting, stuck. Current protective patterns feel wise, discerning, responsive.

### Q: The teaching says the matrix is what we upload to it. But how can I change the collective matrix alone?

**You can't change it alone—but you CAN change your contribution to it.** The collective matrix is made of billions of individual patterns. Every time you transform a fear-based pattern to a love-based one, you change your thread in the matrix. Every conscious choice you make uploads new data. Multiply this by millions of people waking up, and the collective matrix transforms. You're not responsible for the whole—just for your part.

### Q: Isn't "re-educating patterns" just spiritual bypassing? Shouldn't I just face my trauma directly?

**Re-educating patterns IS facing trauma directly—just wisely, not violently.** You can't heal trauma by forcing yourself to "just be different." The pattern developed for a reason—it kept you alive. Honor that, thank it, and then *gently* prove you can be safe in new ways. This is integration, not bypassing. Bypassing says "I should just get over it." Re-education says "I honor what this protected, and I'm ready to transform it consciously."

### Q: If wisdom comes from love activating will, how do I develop more wisdom?

**Practice asking "why, what for, from where" about everything.** Don't just do things automatically—understand the purpose. Don't just feel emotions—understand what will they're moving you toward. Don't just follow patterns—understand what love (connection, survival, protection) they're serving. Wisdom is **conscious understanding of the relationship between love (the eternal matrix) and will (the specific patterns).** Every time you pause to understand instead of react, you develop wisdom.

### Q: This makes the matrix sound neutral, but it feels oppressive. How do I reconcile that?

**The matrix IS neutral—it's a network storing information. What feels oppressive is the CONTENT uploaded to it.** Centuries of fear-based control, domination hierarchies, scarcity programming, separation consciousness—all uploaded to the matrix. You feel it because you're connected to it. But recognizing the matrix is neutral is empowering—it means **it CAN be changed by changing what we upload.** You're not fighting a cosmic evil; you're transforming a network by contributing evolved consciousness.

### Q: Can I integrate eight days into one practice without it taking hours?

**Yes—the full integration takes 10-15 minutes.** Crown to knees, each pair: light splits to hands, unite at corresponding chakra with SSñú. This moves quickly once you're familiar with it. The power is in the energetic integration, not the time spent. Do it daily, and the teachings embed into your nervous system, becoming automatic wisdom rather than intellectual knowledge.

### Q: What's the difference between re-educating a pattern and just developing a new one?

**Re-educating acknowledges and transforms the existing pattern. Developing a new one can bypass the old one without integration.** Example: You have a pattern of "working yourself to exhaustion for approval." New pattern without integration: "I'll just rest and not care what anyone thinks" (swinging to opposite extreme, old pattern still running underneath). Re-education: "I work consciously, resting when needed, proving I'm safe and valuable even without exhaustion-performance" (transforms the core belief, integrates the wisdom).

## Closing Reflection

We are eight days into Libra, and the teaching today reveals the mechanics of how we create our reality:

**Matrix and patterns are not prisons—they are tools.**

**Patterns** are the individual strategies, behaviors, beliefs you use to accomplish purposes (will).

**Matrix** is the network of all patterns together, the field holding infinite potential (love).

**Wisdom** is understanding why they exist and how to use them consciously.

For so long, we've been taught to fear patterns and escape the matrix. "Break your conditioning! Free yourself from programming!"

But this is like saying "Break your knowledge! Free yourself from tools!"

**Patterns aren't inherently bad—they're protection mechanisms.** They kept you alive. They helped you survive. They're useful for specific situations.

The problem is when patterns become unconscious—when you repeat them automatically without understanding their purpose, when they run you instead of you running them.

**The matrix isn't inherently oppressive—it's a network.** It stores information. It reflects what's uploaded to it.

The problem is when we upload fear, control, domination, scarcity—and then wonder why the matrix feels like a cage.

The revolutionary teaching:

**You are creating your matrix with the patterns you choose.**

Every conscious pattern re-education changes your personal matrix.  
Every evolved belief you upload changes the collective matrix.  
Every action taken with wisdom transforms the network.

**You are not trapped. You are the creator.**

Patterns are your will—the specific energies moving you toward purposes.  
Matrix is your love—the eternal field holding all possibilities.  
Wisdom is your consciousness—the understanding that uses both as tools for evolution.

**I Am the Destiny of All Purposes.**

Not "I'm a victim of my patterns."  
Not "I'm trapped in the matrix."  
But **"I am the conscious creator using patterns as tools to fulfill purposes within the matrix I'm creating."**

Tomorrow we continue. Two more pairs to balance. The teaching moves from knees to ankles to torus, completing the Mind Week.

Rest deeply. Create consciously. Upload wisely.

See you tomorrow.
