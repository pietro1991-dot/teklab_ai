## Overview

Welcome to Day 30, the final day of the Leo constellation month, the day of fullness and completion. Today we work with the toroidal field—the magnetic field that surrounds the entire body, unifying all the parts we've worked with this month into one integrated whole. This is the day where everything comes together.

The Leo month has been about recognizing the greatness of the I Am, acknowledging the vastness of the universe and our place within it. We've journeyed through the mind (portal), the emotions (life), and the body (path), working with each chakra and gland to understand ourselves as complete, integrated beings.

Today's teaching on fullness (plenitude in Spanish/Latin) brings us to the culmination: the radical understanding that **enlightenment is not about escaping the body or going to another dimension. Enlightenment is about living fully, completely, and presently IN your body.**

Throughout spiritual history, there has been a pervasive belief that we are trapped in a physical body, imprisoned in physical reality, and that we must escape to reach the spirit, to achieve enlightenment, to go to higher dimensions. This belief has created immense suffering and distortion.

The truth revealed today is the opposite: **The body is not a prison. The body is an expression of spirit.** The spirit has created this reality, this art, and trying to escape from your own creation is rejecting your own artistic expression. Fullness—feeling complete, fulfilled, enlightened—comes from putting together what was separated: spirit, soul, and body as one. **The only way to connect with I Am is to live fully present in our body.**

## Core Teaching

### Plenitude: Putting the Parts Together

The word "plenitude" comes from Latin "plenus" meaning complete, full. Plenitude means "to complete stuff, all the things that were separated, to put them together, to complete them."

Throughout this month, we've been working with three aspects:
- **Mind** (mental, spiritual aspect)
- **Emotion** (soul, feeling aspect)  
- **Body** (physical aspect)

We have also worked with:
- **Spirit** (the consciousness, the higher awareness)
- **Soul** (the bridge, the emotional and energetic body)
- **Body** (the physical vessel, matter)

The work of plenitude is to recognize the coherence of these three aspects together. They are not separate. They create the feeling that you are full, that you fulfill your goals, that you fulfill everything within you. You feel plenty.

"The concept of plenitude that I was talking about today is about to recognize that the only way in which I will reach or achieve enlightenment or clarity is not by going to the spirit—it is by acknowledging that the spirit, the soul, and the body are one and lived together."

### The False Belief: Escape to Enlightenment

Throughout spiritual history and in much of contemporary spirituality, there's been a deeply ingrained belief: **in our pursuit of enlightenment, we need to leave here, to go away from here, in order to find enlightenment and to feel full.**

This belief says: we are trapped in a physical body, in a physical aspect, and we have to set ourselves free from the physical world to reach the spiritual.

The language of spirituality reflects this: we talk about "ascending to another dimension," going to the spirit, getting enlightenment by leaving the body, changing dimensions, going to another world or another star.

This creates the feeling that we are imprisoned, that the body is a jail we must escape from to reach spirit.

### The Truth: Body Is an Expression of Spirit

The radical truth: **In reality, the body is just another expression, an aspect of the spirit.**

The spirit is not inside the body like a prisoner in a cell. The spirit is not separate from the body. **The spirit is not inside the body—it's an aspect of the body. The body is an aspect of the spirit.**

Think about it: everything we call "spirit" is not something external. It's the vibration that makes us exist. The being we call the "higher self" is not a superior being in another location—it is the I AM, the verb of being itself, expressed.

Every projection we do into the outside (calling it "spirit" or "higher dimensions") is just a reflection of the inside. Spirit is not somewhere else. Spirit is here, expressed as matter, as your body, as your lived experience.

### The Spiritual Path: Living Fully in the Body

The teaching is clear and revolutionary: **"It's not by going outside the body we reach enlightenment. It's totally the opposite: it's by you living fully present in your body you reach to enlighten yourself."**

To live in plenitude is to put the parts together, to unite the body, the spirit, the soul—everything that was separated—into one. That's the concept of plenitude. That's what makes us feel we are living, and living fully.

And remember: living here and now is not just the thin slice of "present" isolated from past and future. As we learned yesterday, it's the plenitude of the three times—past, present, and future together—which is eternity.

One of the most important things we need to accomplish in our lives is **to enjoy the creation.**

The creation is not a jail in which you have been trapped and from which you have to escape to get into the spirit. **The spirit has created this reality.** Everything you live is the creation of an artist we call the spirit, the soul, the universe, the divine.

Why would the spirit be trying to escape from its own art? Why would you reject your own creation?

### Pain Comes from Trying to Escape

The teaching states: "The reason why we feel pain and suffering is just that we are not living plenitude in this life. We are always trying to escape from something."

When we believe we're trapped and need to escape, we create suffering. When we reject the body and physical reality as inferior or imprisoning, we fragment ourselves. We separate spirit from body, higher from lower, good from bad.

This separation is the root of suffering. Wholeness, integration, plenitude—this is the path to the end of suffering.

The goal is not to escape reality to connect with spirit. **The goal is to live fully present in our body.** The body is the projection, the external, the most wide open expression of our soul and our spirit.

### Dimensions as Perspectives, Not Places

The teaching clarifies: **"A being doesn't change or go from one dimension to another. A being just expressed, changed its perception of different perspectives of dimensions."**

Dimensions are not locations you travel to. They are perspectives, ways of perceiving reality.

"In reality, each one of us is living in every dimension" right now. We're not in the third dimension trying to ascend to the fifth. We exist across all dimensions simultaneously; we're just not conscious of it.

"What we have to do is to open ourselves to perceive other dimensions," not to leave this one and go to another.

When we say "ascend to another dimension," what we actually mean is: **expand our perception to include other perspectives of reality** while still being fully here.

### The Example of St. Francis

The teaching references St. Francis of Assisi as an example of someone who could see the most beautiful light in the most dirty, darkest reality.

This is the sign of enlightenment: not escaping from darkness to light, but seeing light everywhere, even in darkness. Not leaving the material to reach the spiritual, but recognizing spirit in all matter.

St. Francis didn't reject the physical world as base or unspiritual. He saw divinity in everything—in poverty, in suffering, in animals, in the body, in nature. He was fully present in the physical world while simultaneously aware of its spiritual nature.

### The Body as Temple: Honoring the Sacred Vessel

Throughout this teaching, the body is referred to as "the temple" where soul and spirit inhabit.

This is not metaphorical. Your body is sacred. It is the holy dwelling place of your consciousness. It is the artistic expression of the divine.

The practice asks: **Do you see your body? Do you like your body? Do you accept your body? Do you judge your body?**

Most people have a conflicted relationship with their bodies—judging, criticizing, wishing it were different, trying to transcend it.

The path to plenitude requires accepting, honoring, and loving your body. Not as a prison to escape from, but as the perfect vehicle for your consciousness, the beautiful expression of spirit in matter.

### The Perfection of Biology

The meditation guides us deep into the body to perceive its wonder:

"Allow the energy of the I Am to express itself inside my body, to show me the potential of my own body, the beauty of its own natural biology."

We're invited to feel the light of I Am shining inside the body, "showing the marvelous biology that is trying to keep you alive constantly in balance, homeostasis—every molecule, cell, organ that is working, expressing its own beauty to the inner cosmos."

We go deeper: feeling the cells, recognizing each cell as perfect, shining the best of its potential, trying to replicate the beauty of the universe in your temple, in your own body.

The cells don't see the whole body, yet they do everything for it to exist, beyond themselves. This is the perfection and selflessness built into every level of your being.

We go even deeper: into the molecules that compose and form the cells. Into the atoms inside the molecules. Into the space between the atoms. And in that space, we feel the waves, the vibrations.

**In that vibration, you can perceive the spirit, the essence, consciousness.**

This is the revelation: when you go deep enough into matter, you find spirit. They are not separate. Matter IS spirit vibrating at a certain frequency. The boundary between them is illusory.

### The Path to Heaven on Earth

The speaker says: "I guess what I was trying to share is that we, as spiritual people, used to go with this idea that we need to set ourselves free and go into the beauty of heaven."

But in the month ahead (Virgo), and really in all our spiritual work: **"We need to practice to enjoy the body, to realize that the body is the expression of the spirit, the body is the physical aspect of the consciousness."**

Our goal is **to live fully present in our body so that we could bring the heaven on earth, in our reality.**

This is the shift: not escaping earth to reach heaven, but bringing heaven to earth. Not leaving the body to reach spirit, but embodying spirit so fully that heaven is right here.

"Remember, we are not doing this path to set ourselves free from this reality. We are here because we need to acknowledge what we have created. This is our art. We must enjoy it. We must experience it, be happy with the experience we created."

"This is what our goal is: the spirit within us desires to become the spirit living and experiencing in this body."

### The Transition to Virgo

Today marks the end of Leo month (I Am, Icon) and the beginning of Virgo month (I Analyze).

Leo has been about the greatness of concepts, the vastness of the universe, recognizing the I Am in its fullness.

Virgo will be about getting specific, working with tiny details, putting order into the small things of our lives, analyzing, writing things down, working with precision.

The speaker recommends having a notebook and pen ready for the Virgo month, as the work will involve writing and analyzing tiny things. (And humorously warns air and water signs not to be lazy and say "I can imagine it, I don't need to write it down"—the Virgo earth energy requires actually writing.)

This transition from the expansive, grand energy of Leo to the detailed, analytical energy of Virgo is natural and necessary. We've recognized the greatness; now we work with the specifics.

## Practice

### Preparation

Begin with massage, stretching, yawning. As you touch your body, thank the spirit for being the anchor. Thank the body for being the anchor of the spirit in matter.

Relax deeply. Become aware of your breathing, of your body.

Set the intention to experience plenitude—the integration of spirit, soul, and body—and to fully inhabit and honor your physical temple.

### Main Practice: Experiencing the Perfection of Spirit in Matter

**Step 1:** Take deep breaths. Go with the oxygen to your lungs, your heart, all the blood, every organ, every muscle. Feel and recognize the heat within your body.

**Step 2:** Feel how this heat goes outside through the skin, filling up the aura and all the magnetic field. Realize this heat is the strength of the spirit that is within you.

**Step 3:** Feel the energy coming out of your body, becoming the energy of the soul in the emotional level and the spirit in the mental level. See/feel the fresh light of the soul coming from the moon (your own moon). Feel the heat, the warm light of the spirit shining like the sun all over your skin.

**Step 4:** All the energy that is within you shines outside of you, creating your toroidal field, your aura, your electromagnetic presence. Recognize yourself as the temple of this soul, this spirit.

**Step 5:** Be aware of each tiny part of your body, of your own temple. Become aware of and honor your temple, your body—the physical expression of your soul and spirit, your own self.

**Step 6:** Take a moment to think: Do you see your body? Do you like your body? Do you accept your body? Do you judge your body? Try to feel and think if you accept your own body. Notice without judgment whatever arises.

**Step 7:** Take a deep breath and affirm: "I will allow the energy of the I Am to express itself inside my body, to show me the potential of my own body, the beauty of its own natural biology."

**Step 8:** Start to bring the energy, the light of the spirit and the soul inside your own body. Feel it going through the cupola at the crown, through the roses and windows of your eyes, toward the candles, going down to the bells of your throat, the sacristy in your heart, the altar at the plexus, the hall and choir in the sacrum, the portal in the genitals, the two paths in the knees, the horizon between heaven and earth in your feet.

**Step 9:** Feel the light of the I Am shining inside your own body, showing the marvelous biology that is trying to keep you alive constantly in balance, in homeostasis. Every molecule, cell, organ is working, expressing its own beauty to the inner cosmos.

**Step 10:** Try to caress the tips of your fingers, your hands softly. Feel the skin, the touch, the sensations. Perceive the wonders of the microcosm.

**Step 11:** Go deeper in perception. See with your inner vision: each cell is perfect, shining the best of its potential, trying to replicate the beauty of the universe in your temple, in your own body. The cells don't see the whole, yet they do everything for it to exist, beyond themselves.

**Step 12:** Take a sigh (deep release breath) on yourself. Now go deep within, perceiving the molecules that compose and form the cells.

**Step 13:** Go deeper still. Inside the molecules, see the atoms—very tiny. Between the atoms is vast space.

**Step 14:** In that space, you feel the waves, the vibrations. In that vibration, you can perceive the spirit, the essence, consciousness itself. Matter and spirit are one.

**Step 15:** Allow yourself to expand the spirit from the waves to the atoms, to the molecules, the cells, every cell, every organ, through your skin toward the magnetic field around you.

**Step 16:** As you express outward, say to yourself: "I can live the spirit in my body. I can express my soul in my body. I can live plenitude in my body."

**Step 17:** Pronounce the sound "Sh" (like "shh"), starting to express around all the light of the spirit from every atom of your body. Chant "Sh" multiple times, feeling the vibration.

**Step 18:** Allow yourself to feel the sensation through all your body, through all your skin. As you pronounce the vibration "Sh," allow yourself to feel that in this expression of the sound, you feel the spirit, the perfection expressing itself from every cell.

**Step 19:** Feel the perception of the perfection of your matter, of your body, for you are the spirit expressed in a body.

**Step 20:** Recognize: "Like this, my body is the path to eternity. I Am the Eternal Path. I Am the Eternal Path. I Am the Eternal Path."

**Step 21:** Take a deep breath and bring your hands to your heart to balance. "I can live plenitude in my body. I become fully aware that my body is an eternal expression of the spirit, a fractal expressed from the eternity of my soul and my spiritual mind."

**Step 22:** "I can live fully, completely, here and now in my body, for I Am the Eternal Path."

**Step 23:** Take a deep breath. From your heart, as you exhale, take the awareness, consciousness through all your body. Stretching, massaging, yawning, go back to normal awareness and softly open your eyes.

### Closing

You have finished with the first month of this year-long journey. Here and now, you are I Am.

The teaching to remember: we as spiritual people used to go with the idea that we need to set ourselves free and go into the beauty of heaven. But in the month ahead, we need to practice to enjoy the body, to realize the body is the expression of the spirit, the body is the physical aspect of consciousness.

Our goal is to live fully present in our body so that we could bring the heaven on earth, in our reality.

"Remember, we are not doing this path to set ourselves free from this reality. We are here because we need to acknowledge what we have created. This is our art. We must enjoy it. We must experience it, be happy with the experience we created."

"This is what our goal is: the spirit within us desires to become the spirit living and experiencing in this body."

The task: Take a bath if you have a bathtub. Try to make the water the same temperature as your body—warm, body temperature. Caress every part of your skin just for the feeling, the sensation. Think that you are giving a cleaning to your body, grateful for the body, for everything it does for you.

If you don't have a bathtub, do the same with a shower. Make it quiet, contemplative, honoring. This is a baptism of sorts—blessing your body, recognizing it as sacred.

Rest a lot. Drink a lot of water. Prepare for the Virgo month ahead, which will be about analyzing the specific, tiny details of your life and putting them in order.

Journal about this month's journey. What has shifted in your understanding of I Am? Of your body? Of enlightenment? How do you feel about the teaching that you are here to enjoy your creation, not escape from it?

## Integration

This teaching may challenge everything you've been taught about spirituality. Sit with that. If you've been seeking enlightenment by trying to transcend the body, escape the earth, or reach some other dimension—what does it mean to realize enlightenment is right here, in this body, in this moment?

Examine your relationship with your body. Do you see it as a prison or a temple? Do you judge it, wish it were different, see it as inferior to "spirit"? What would it mean to truly honor your body as the sacred expression of your consciousness?

Practice enjoying your physical existence. Eat with pleasure and presence. Move with joy. Feel sensations fully. Engage your senses. This is not indulgence or being unspiritual—this is recognizing that your body and physical experience are sacred.

Work with the cellular meditation from today's practice. Going deep into your body—cells, molecules, atoms, space, vibration—and finding spirit there is a powerful practice for dissolving the illusion of separation between matter and spirit.

Pay attention to language. Notice when you say or think things like "I want to get out of here," "I can't wait to leave this body," "I want to ascend to higher dimensions." These reveal the belief in separation and escape. Gently reframe: "I want to be fully here. I want to embody spirit. I want to perceive all dimensions while being fully present."

Prepare for the Virgo month by getting a notebook and pen. The energy is shifting from vast, conceptual, grand (Leo) to specific, detailed, analytical (Virgo). Both are necessary. We recognize the greatness of I Am, and then we work with the tiny details of how that expresses in daily life.

Remember the key teaching: we are not here to escape. We are here to acknowledge, enjoy, and experience what we have created. This life, this body, this earth—this is the art of spirit. Honor it as such.

## Q&A

**Q: Doesn't every spiritual tradition teach that we need to transcend the material to reach the spiritual?**

**A:** Many do, but not all, and this teaching suggests that's a misunderstanding of the true path. Even in traditions that use the language of "transcendence," often what's actually meant is transcending attachment or limited perception, not leaving the physical. The body is not the problem; identification with ONLY the physical and ignorance of the spiritual is the problem. True transcendence is including and integrating all levels—physical, emotional, mental, spiritual—not rejecting the lower to reach the higher. Some mystical branches of all traditions have always known this: the Divine is right here in matter, not somewhere else.

**Q: If I'm supposed to fully enjoy my body and physical life, does that mean I should indulge every desire?**

**A:** No. There's a difference between honoring your body and being a slave to every impulse. Enjoying your physical existence means being present with and grateful for your body, treating it well, experiencing sensations and pleasures consciously. It doesn't mean addiction, compulsion, or harming yourself through excess. In fact, truly honoring your body often means discerning what actually serves it versus what just temporarily gratifies an unconscious pattern. Plenitude is wholeness and balance, not indulgence.

**Q: What about people who experience chronic pain or illness? How can they "enjoy" their body?**

**A:** This teaching isn't saying you have to feel only pleasure in your body or pretend suffering doesn't exist. It's saying: recognize your body as the sacred vehicle for your consciousness, even when it's in pain. The body is still your temple, still the expression of spirit, even when it's sick or hurting. Honoring it might look like: working skillfully with the pain, giving it appropriate care, being present with what is rather than constantly wishing to escape it, and recognizing that even in limitation and suffering, you are still fully spirit embodied. Many people with chronic conditions have profound spiritual awakenings because they're forced to be present with their body in ways healthy people never are.

**Q: I've had experiences of consciousness expanding beyond my body. Wasn't that real? Was I wrong to seek that?**

**A:** Those experiences are absolutely real and valuable! The teaching isn't saying consciousness doesn't extend beyond the body—clearly it does, as evidenced by the toroidal field, by out-of-body experiences, by psychic perception, etc. The teaching is saying: don't seek those experiences as an escape FROM the body, and don't reject embodiment as inferior. Consciousness can expand beyond the body AND be fully present in the body simultaneously. The error is thinking you have to leave the body to be truly spiritual. Expanded consciousness that then returns to and fully inhabits the body is enlightenment.

**Q: How is this different from materialism or just being focused on physical pleasures?**

**A:** Materialism says only matter is real, spirit doesn't exist or doesn't matter. This teaching says matter IS spirit, they're not separate. Materialism is unconscious—it doesn't see the spiritual nature of matter. This teaching is the opposite—fully conscious recognition that matter is sacred, that your body is a divine expression. Being focused on physical pleasures unconsciously (addictions, compulsions, filling a void) is very different from consciously experiencing and honoring your physical existence as a spiritual practice.

**Q: What about near-death experiences where people report leaving their body and feeling more alive than ever? Doesn't that suggest the body is limiting?**

**A:** NDEs are real and profound. What they often reveal is that consciousness is not limited to the physical body—which this teaching agrees with. But many people who've had NDEs report coming back with a DEEPER appreciation for physical life and the body, not a desire to escape it. The experience of consciousness beyond the body can show us the vastness of what we are, AND then we bring that awareness into embodiment, living more fully as spirit in matter. The body isn't a limitation of consciousness—it's a focalization, a particular expression. The whole ocean is not limited by being expressed as a wave; the wave is the ocean in a specific form.

**Q: How do I reconcile this teaching with my religious upbringing that said the flesh is sinful and we should focus on heaven?**

**A:** This is a profound reprogramming for anyone raised with that teaching. It helps to understand that "flesh" in many religious contexts means "unconscious animal nature" or "ego" not "physical body" per se. The teaching to "focus on heaven" might be better understood as "remember your divine nature" rather than "escape from earth." Many mystics in all religious traditions have found the divine right here in matter. You might explore the mystical branches of your tradition to find this thread. Ultimately, you'll need to sit with what resonates as truth for you. If the teaching that your body is sacred and enlightenment is right here feels like truth, trust that, even if it's different from what you were taught.

**Q: I feel more spiritual when I'm fasting or doing practices that minimize my focus on the body. Is that wrong?**

**A:** Not wrong, but perhaps incomplete. Fasting and similar practices can be powerful for shifting awareness and creating space for spiritual experience—they have value. But if you're using them to escape from or punish the body, that's the shadow side. If you're using them consciously as a practice to shift perception and then coming back to honoring embodiment, that's the light side. The key is: are you doing it from rejection of the body or from conscious choice as part of a balanced spiritual practice? After the fast, do you return to your body with more presence and gratitude, or do you just feel more justified in seeing it as base and problematic?

**Q: What's the practical difference this teaching makes in my daily life?**

**A:** Huge difference. Instead of seeing your daily life, body care, physical existence, relationships, work as "not spiritual" or "less important than meditation/prayer," you recognize all of it as sacred. Eating becomes communion. Moving becomes prayer. Caring for your body becomes honoring the temple. Engaging with others becomes recognizing spirit in form. You stop waiting for some future enlightenment and recognize that enlightenment is being fully here, fully conscious, fully present in your life as it is. This creates joy, presence, and gratitude in ordinary moments rather than the constant dissatisfaction of seeking something "higher" somewhere else.
