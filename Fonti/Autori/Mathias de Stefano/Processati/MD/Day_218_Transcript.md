# Day 218 - The Eighth Dimension: The Akashic Records

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Knees
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Emotional Week
- **Main Topic:** The Eighth Dimension - Universal Registry, Akashic Records, Time and Space Grid
- **Vibration:** `LHu`
- **Statement:** `I Am Love that Enlightens`
- **Code:** Having - the next cosmic attribute is the one that emerges from realizing what the being has inside, everything that lays within and that can be taken outside. Having is the cosmic attribute of the being that recognizes the tools it has and expresses the faculty of valuing what is intrinsic to us and what can we get, those gifts. This way, the being says "I have," referring to everything that it covers within itself and what can be obtained by its own creation.

## Overview

For Matias, the eighth dimension is profoundly important because **it is where he started**. All his memories, the network, all his concepts are born in the eighth dimension. This is why understanding it matters so deeply to him.

The eighth dimension is the **universal database**, the registry of all that exists—past, present, and future of every being, every atom, every molecule in the entire universe. This is what ancient traditions call the **Akashic Records**.

We are now in the Emotional Week of Pisces, moving from the mental understanding of dimensions into the feeling of them. The eighth dimension is where **essence, sense, and experience** meet—where the perfume of a flower (essence) requires the sense of smell (sense) to be perceived (experience).

This teaching connects to the knees chakra, which represents our ability to move forward on our path while carrying the wisdom of all our ancestors, all our past, all our accumulated experience. The knees hold us upright as we walk through time and space.

Today we discover that the eighth dimension is not just a storage place but an active, living process—like bees gathering nectar and pollen from the flower of the seventh dimension, creating honey in the present, building the structures of the past.

## Clarifying Billions of Beings Across Dimensions

### The Question of Many Beings

Some people were confused when Matias spoke about beings living in different dimensions. If we are all one, why does he speak about "the people that live in the sixth dimension," "beings that live in the seventh dimension"?

Here is the clarification:

Just as we have **eight billion people** on this planet in physical reality—all sharing this reality, all living in the third dimension—there are also billions of beings in every other dimension.

We are **all in the third dimension**: billions of humans, millions of animals, minerals, plants, and also the planets, the sun, the moon. Millions of beings in the third dimension, not only on this planet but on other planets too.

Equally, we have **billions of beings in the fourth dimension**, billions in the fifth, billions in the sixth, billions in the seventh, and so on.

### Projecting Across Dimensions

Each being projects itself across dimensions. **I** exist in the third dimension, but I also have another aspect in the fourth dimension, another in the fifth, another in the sixth, another in the seventh.

**I am projecting myself** across dimensions. Not only me—my friend is doing that, my brother is doing that, my neighbor is doing that.

That is why we have billions of beings in each dimension.

### Many Paths to the One

The image is that **we are all one**, and we all come back to the one. But there are billions of ways of arriving. It is like one being living in different levels (the dimensions), experiencing different perspectives.

There are **many of the Ones**—many possibilities. All of them are going to the One, but through different paths, in different levels.

### The Tree and the Master

Imagine a huge being of light in the seventh dimension. But in the third dimension, that being is **a tree in the Amazon**. We tend to believe that if there is a master at a higher level, our original being must be a master or an angel. But maybe it is just a tree in our dimension—its physical aspect is a tree.

This means **everyone is multidimensional**. Everyone is living in different dimensions, even if they do not have the same patterns.

A master in the fifth dimension might be, in the third dimension, only a tree. How can we listen to that master? How can we receive information from that master? **Through the network.** By patterns of geometry, these beings are connected—not separated, but all interconnected like a web.

## The Phone Metaphor: Understanding Dimensions

### The Physical, Software, and Network

Matias offers a clear example to understand how dimensions exist even when we are not connected to them: the **telephone**.

You have a **cell phone** here, physical—3D. Inside, you have the **software**, the programming that makes the phone work—that is the **fourth dimension**. Then you have the **algebra**, the mathematics that gives meaning to everything—that is the **fifth dimension**. Then you have the **Wi-Fi**, the information going through waves—that is the **seventh dimension**.

### When the Phone Breaks

Now imagine: if you **break the phone**, make it into pieces, does that mean the seventh dimension disappears? Does the programming, the algebra disappear?

No. **They are still there.** They live by themselves in that dimension. They are still existing. The only thing that broke was the phone—the third-dimensional aspect.

That is why when the third-dimensional aspect **dies**, you are still there in the fourth dimension, the fifth dimension, the seventh dimension.

### The Cloud

The fourth dimension is like **the cloud**—where you upload all the information. If the phone breaks, it does not matter because you have everything in the cloud (fourth dimension) and the fifth dimension.

That is what happens when we die.

### The Update

Some phones did not make the **update**. If you do not do the update, you will be living with the old software of the phone—the old chakras of your soul.

People who make an update are able to **download information from the network** (the fifth dimension).

## The Eighth Dimension: The Grid of Time and Space

### The Seventh Dimension Radiating

Remember: the seventh dimension is the potential of the entire universe, radiating light toward **twelve directions**. Each ray creates a torus expanding outward.

The seventh dimension is like the core of the Earth—so much pressure that energy must be released. Earthquakes are the release of energy from the core. The seventh dimension works the same way: it expands energy, which goes out and is absorbed on the other side.

### Twelve Torus Creating the Grid

This structure has **twelve rays**, and each one does the same thing, expanding patterns. When you keep expanding these patterns, you see **twelve torus** that multiply by thousands, creating many, many patterns.

What does this structure remind you of? **The grid of time and space.**

### The Crosses of Time and Space

In each cross where the lines intersect, you find one line of **time** and one line of **space**. They create a **node** that becomes **matter**. This node is what we call **here and now**.

Each node where time and space cross is the creation of matter through the pressure of here and now.

### The Sphere of the Eighth Dimension

These nodes are not just a few—they are **all around**, creating a sphere. Because a sphere is the product of the fractalization of the triangle. A triangle fractalized thousands and millions of times creates a circle, then a sphere.

Each cross of time and space represents **billions of nodes of matter** that create the surface of this sphere. This is the eighth dimension.

## The Essence, Sense, and Experience

### The Process of Creation

In the eighth dimension, we have three aspects working together:

- **Essence** (the future): The perfume of a flower, the potential, what radiates outward.
- **Sense** (the present): The ability to perceive—smell, sight, touch, taste, hearing.
- **Experience** (the past): The act of perceiving, the structures created.

The **essence** is the perfume. The **sense** is smell. The **experience** is to smell.

### The Flower and the Bees

Imagine the seventh dimension as a **flower** in the center. The **future** is the perfume, the essence you can perceive. Beings from the future take from this flower the **nectar** (remember, nectar means "death," but those who drink it become immortal) and the **pollen**.

The **bees of consciousness** come to the flower, taking nectar and pollen. What do they do in the **present**? They experiment, creating things with the nectar and pollen.

With these products and experiences in the present, beings from the future create the **past**—the structures, the patterns of reality. They create the honeycomb with all its geometry, its elegance. They create **honey**.

### Two Presents

We have **two presents**: the present we live here (experiencing the flower) and the present we live around (processing the past, creating honey). During the present, we process all the past, and we create the past. Then we have another moment of present where we receive the products of the past.

The bees from the past bring pollen back to the flower so the flower can expand, create roots, and blossom in the next spring.

## The Akashic Records

### The Registry of All Light

The eighth dimension is the **registry**, the **roots of all**, the **database of the entire universe**. This is what we call the **Akashic Records**.

"Akasha" in Sanskrit means **light**. So Akashic Records means "the records, the registry of all the light."

We have light in the center (the seventh dimension), shining. The eighth dimension is **all the data of that light**.

### The Great Spider

In ancient times, people used to call the eighth dimension **the Great Spider**, **Mania**.

The eighth dimension is where **everything is registered**—everything. Past, present, future. The story of our spirit, the story of our soul, the story of our body. Every power, everything is there. It is the **matrix**.

### The Difference from the Fourth Dimension

The fourth dimension has only **one line of time** for one being—the life of one person. But in the eighth dimension, it is **all of them together**: billions and trillions of beings, past, present, and future of **all**, of everything that exists.

## Mathematics, Geometry, Reality

### For the Logical Mind

From a poetic point of view:
- **Essence** = perfume of a flower
- **Sense** = smell
- **Experience** = to smell

From a colder, more logical point of view:
- **Essence** = mathematics
- **Sense** = geometry
- **Experience** = reality

Reality does not exist without geometry. Geometry does not exist without mathematics.

So for the poetic people and the mathematicians, the eighth dimension is where **essence designs the senses** in order to be able to perceive itself, to experience itself.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing. Take a deep breath, becoming aware of the place where you are, and use your imagination to expand it toward the infinite, perceiving how the world vanishes into eternity.

### Floating in the Void

As you stay in the center, floating in the void of the cosmos, remember the **light** that you have been—the light that expands like a rainbow all around in every direction.

### Recognizing All Your Timelines

Remember that you are the **potential** that gives origin to all your times and spaces. You are your past, present, and future.

Observe all your life in front of you. Try to remember, bring the memories to images since the moment you were born, throughout your childhood, teenagehood, and adulthood. Perceive that you are close to death. Feel it close to you.

See your entire life pass by in front of your eyes.

### Drinking Death

Take a deep breath. In that instant of death, in the middle of lights and darkness, **let go of all your life**. Dare to **drink the death** instead of running from it.

Allow death to transform you into your own light, into the darkness, into the **nectar that makes you immortal**.

By being immortal, you expand your eternity.

### The Torus of All Lives

From your eternity, expand the **future** without any limits—above, around your sides, the present, and under, the past. Absorb it all, going back to the core, to eternity.

Repeat this process once again.

Recognize that it is not anymore only your life that goes in front of your eyes—it is **all of them**. All around: past lives, present lives, parallel lives, future ones, all of them creating the **torus** around you.

All life from every dimension, every timeline, every space—all of it expanding and contracting once again in the torus, coming back to the core, to eternity.

### The Vibration LHu

**I am the origin of all time and all space.**

**I am the essence of existence.**

Sound the vibration **LHu** from your knees, feeling the path you walk enlightened by all timelines.

**I Am love that enlightens. I Am love that enlightens. I Am love that enlightens.**

**I am the nurturer of life. I believe, I believe, I believe.**

### Closing

See a star expanding this consciousness all through your body. Take a deep breath. Each one in your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, contemplate the idea that **everything is already recorded**. Your past, your present, your future—all exist simultaneously in the eighth dimension.

When you remember something, you are not pulling from "the past"—you are accessing the **registry**, the database. When you envision your future, you are not creating something new—you are **reading** what already exists in potential.

Practice seeing your life as the **bees of consciousness** see the flower: taking nectar (essence) and pollen (potential), working in the present to create structures, building the honeycomb of your reality.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel lost, remember: you have access to the **Akashic Records**. The entire story of your spirit, soul, and body is registered. You can access this through meditation, through deep presence, through the network of consciousness.

When you fear death, remember: the phone may break, but the software, the algebra, the Wi-Fi—**they remain**. Your essence continues in all dimensions.

When you want to manifest, remember: essence designs sense to experience itself. What is your essence? What sense (geometry) will you use? What experience (reality) will you create?

## Week Context

We are in the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, moving from mental understanding to emotional knowing. The eighth dimension is felt as the **registry of love**—every emotion, every feeling, every experience of love throughout all time and space is recorded here.

Pisces dissolves boundaries, and the eighth dimension embodies this: all beings, all times, all spaces recorded as one unified database. There is no separation in the Akashic Records—only the infinite variations of the One experiencing itself.

## Q&A

### Q: If everything is already recorded in the eighth dimension, do I have free will?

Yes. The eighth dimension records **all possibilities**—past, present, and future. It is not one predetermined timeline but the **database of all timelines**. You have free will to choose which timeline you walk. The eighth dimension simply records them all.

### Q: How can I access the Akashic Records?

Through deep meditation, through presence, through the knees chakra (the path of your ancestors). When you quiet the mind and open the heart, you can access the registry. Many people access it in dreams, in visions, or in moments of profound clarity.

### Q: Why is the eighth dimension associated with the knees chakra?

The knees represent your **path**, your ability to move forward while carrying the wisdom of all who came before you. The eighth dimension is the registry of all paths, all ancestors, all futures. The knees are where you physically connect to the earth while walking your unique timeline.

### Q: What is the difference between the Akashic Records and the fourth dimension?

The fourth dimension is **one being's timeline**—your personal process through time. The Akashic Records (eighth dimension) are **all beings' timelines together**—the entire universal database of past, present, and future for every atom, molecule, and consciousness.

### Q: How do the bees of consciousness relate to me personally?

You are the bee. You take nectar and pollen (inspiration, potential) from the flower of the seventh dimension (pure light/potential), work with it in the present (your life), and create structures (your reality, your honey). Then you bring pollen back to the flower so it can bloom again. This is the cycle of creation.

### Q: If I'm a tree in the third dimension but a master in the fifth, which one am I really?

**Both**. You are all aspects simultaneously. The question assumes separation. In truth, you are the entire network—tree, human, master, angel—all connected through geometric patterns. Your awareness determines which aspect you identify with in any moment.

### Q: Does the eighth dimension mean my future is already written?

Your future exists as **potential** in the registry, but which version manifests depends on your choices now. Think of it as a library containing every possible book of your life. The eighth dimension has them all on the shelf. You choose which one to read by how you live.
