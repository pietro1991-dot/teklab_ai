## Introduction

Hello everybody , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you. How are you to take a walk around the eighth dimension?

So for me , the eighth dimension is very important for myself because it 's the one that gives meaning to all what I do. Basically , I started there. All the memories , remember , the network , all those concepts are born in the eighth dimension.

So that 's why for me is so important. I would try to explain it with the tools that I have. I came back to this horrible , artificial production.

So as we spoke yesterday , the seventh dimension is the one that is in the center of this creation of the creation itself. The seventh dimension is in the core of the sixth dimension , which is the structure with many different options that transforms once and again.

So the sixth dimension is holding the seventh dimension. The seventh dimension is flourishing the sixth dimension.

## Q&A

So here we have the seventh dimension , irritating towards each one of the dots. The sixth dimension is creating that energy that they absorb. Therefore we go to the eighth dimension that does n't have this dots , this point of reference. I would like to explain and clarify something that some people were asking or maybe is confusing some people and I say it constantly , which is we are all one in this dimension.

It 's only fractal. But even though when I explain the people that lives in that dimension , the people that lives in the sixth dimension , the beings that lives in the seventh dimension , so maybe that would be confusing for some people.

Sorry , that 's a huge.

So as we are millions of people , eight billion people in this planet , in the physical reality , we all share this reality. We are all living in this reality. Thousands of millions of humans , millions of planets , millions of minerals of animals , and also the planets , the sun , the moon.

So we are millions of beings in the third dimension. We are all in the third dimension.

So when we are being of the third dimension , we are talking about the billions of beings that exist in the third dimension , not only in this planet but in other planets too.

So now , equally as we have here , billions of beings in the third dimension , in the fourth dimension , we also have billions of beings , in the fifth , we have billions of beings in the sixth , we have billions of beings , okay.

So we have billions and billions of beings , because myself , in the third dimension , but but we have also myself , I have another one in the fourth dimension. Another one in the fifth dimension. Another one in the sixth dimension , another one in the seventh dimension.

So I am projecting myself , not only me. My friend is doing that , my brothers doing that , my neighbors doing that.

So that 's why we have billions of beings in each one of the dimensions. Like Mahanseria , that 's all , Somosuna. See , it 's all the volume of Saloon. The image would be that we are all one and we all come back to the one.

So now , let 's say that this billions of ways of arriving is only one is like one being , but living in different levels , which are the dimensions. First dimension , second dimension , third dimension , fifth dimension.

So we have different dimensions , dimensions of only one being , that is , living different perspectives.

So that 's why we say the means of the third dimension , the means of the four dimensions , the means of the fifth dimension , but it 's only one. But there are many of the ones , many possibilities. All of them are going to the one , but through different path in different levels.

So for example , we would say that , imagine that we have a huge being of light in the seven dimensions here , but in the third dimension , that being is a tree in the Amasya.

So we usually tend to believe that if there is a master or higher level , my original being , it would be a master or , or an artist like that , but maybe it 's just a tree in our dimension. It 's physical aspect is a tree.

So means that everyone is multidimensional.

So everyone is living in different dimensions , even if they do n't have the same patterns or whatever.

So now for example , also can happen that I have a master in the fifth dimension , in dimension , third dimension is a tree , is only a tree. But in the fifth dimension is a high master. And how can I listen to that high master? How can I receive the information from that high master?

So because we have connections through the network.

So by patterns of geometry , these beings are connected. They are not separated like this one. No , they are all interconnected like this.

So that 's the connection of the networks.

So now for example , take a tree as an example , but you can put it wherever , you can put it as a cat or as a dog or a stone , that 's not a matter. It 's a physical aspect of someone.

So in other dimensions , you will have a master in the fifth dimension. You will have the master that sees everything , but in the third dimension is a tree. It 's just a tree. It does n't mean that the tree is the master.

The master is aspect in the fifth dimension.

So for example , there are people that live a very human life , like normal life. Not even though they are , I do n't know , ascended people , like huge masters in other dimensions or in light of beings like angels or whatever , in other dimensions. But in this one , they are not.

So somehow maybe someday they will manage to connect with the cell download the information of themselves from other dimensions.

So for example , something that I think is very clear to understand how the dimensions are there , even if we are not connected to that part , is explaining a phone. A telephone.

So you have a cell phone here , physical. It 's 3D. You have it in 3 dimensions.

So when you have that in 3 dimensions , you also know that inside if you have a software , the software is all the programmatic that makes the phone work.

So that would be the fourth dimension. And then you have 3D , you have the algebra. And that 's the fifth dimension. The one that gets meaning to all.

The one that makes everything work really. If they are the dimension , the algebra. And then you have the Wi-Fi , which is like the seventh dimension , all the information going on in the waves.

So now I imagine that if I break the phone , if I make it into pieces , it does n't mean that the seventh dimension I 'll ask of myself , that the programming that algebra disappear , they are still there. They live by themselves in that dimension. They are still there , existing. The only thing that broke was the phone , which is the third dimensional aspect.

So that 's why when the third dimensional aspect dies , you are still there in the fourth dimension.

So the fourth dimension is like the cloud , like where you upload all the information.

So if the phone breaks , it does n't matter because I have everything in the cloud , which is the fourth dimension in the fifth dimension.

So it lost. That 's what happened with we die.

So the thing is that some phones that did n't make the upload.

Sorry , then how to say this? The update of the phone.

So if you do n't do the update , you 'll be living with the old software of the phone , which is the old charge of your soul , okay? And the people that make an update of the phone are able to download information from the network , the fifth dimension.

So with the example of the phone , maybe you can get a little bit better how they mentioned connecting with us.

Okay.

So long that now I try to clarify why we have so many things in different dimensions.

So just as another example , imagine that the body is God that my body is an entire God.

So we can say for some of the these fingers are the second dimension. The hand is the third dimension. With this is the fourth dimension. Here the fifth dimension.

Six dimension here. Seven dimension. And so on.

So this means that we have a human here , an angel here , an archangel here , protested , carbine , whatever.

So different parts of the body are different parts of the universe , but there it 's all one. That each part has billions of which specific individuality of each one of them.

So that 's how we can also the entire thing.

So maybe what we are doing just is watching the tip of the finger of the universe that we are. And the cells can communicate in between one another.

Okay. One.

So the potential of the entire universe , the seventh dimension.

So the seventh dimension is like this light of potential of the entire universe. And this energy is so strong , so hard that it needs to be released to be expressed. It 's like for example in our dimension , they have a lot of pressure. Earth has a lot of pressure in the core because of the gravity and the atmosphere.

It is heavy.

So very heavy.

So sometimes that energy that is created inside needs to go out , to set itself free. And that that release of energies what we experience as airsquake. The airs are the moving the movement of the crust of the planet because of that release of energy.

Okay.

So in the seventh dimension happens exactly the same.

So it is pan expressed this amount of energy and it goes out and comes back being absorbed by the other side. But remember that this structure has 12 rays. Come on , NA.

So because this has 7 rays , each one of them will do exactly the same. What this is generating.

So take a look at what this is generating. If I keep expanding this patterns , look what 's happening.

So what you see here is 12 tons , 12 tons that they start to multiply by thousands. And again , creating many , many patterns. What this reminds you , this structure here. This can remind you the constant of time and space that we have been speaking about.

Can you see how the grid of time and space appears?

So this is the origin of the lines of time and space. The conjunction of all the tons that creates this dimension is the one that holds the grid of time and space that we call the net.

So in each one of the crosses , I will find with one specifically time , line and space line.

So what they are doing here , they start to bend themselves. They start to bend the lines of time and line of space.

So that 's the bending of time and space , the creation of them. I 'm going right the other one going left is exactly as sunflower distributes the seats. In two spirals , what to one side , I want the other side.

So now take a look about to this , that the height of the seven dimension expanded in the eighth dimension is the one that creates the basis of the constant of time and space that we 'll hold all the other , all the other creations , all the other dimensions.

So this means that the eighth dimension is the essence of all things. Is the one that allows everything to emerge , to exist? Is it a dimension that brings logic to the constant of time and space?

Now let 's go to see it from another point of view. From this 12 torus that we just saw in the previous image , now we 're going to take only one torus , so to only race. We take the other 10 and we just take only one. That we will call positive and negative.

So now see this from the core of the seven dimension. The energy to expand outside in the shape of time and the time turns into space and it goes back and creates a new time that goes back and creates a new space. This time starts to expand out.

So time , expand and matter , contracts.

So this expansion here makes the feeling of a time-call future. This is gravity here because it starts to contract everything that was around , starts to contract into only one thing.

So this is why this time here will be called as past. And in the middle point we will find the present. And this here will be called eternity.

So now see this. Is the future that expands and is the future that creates the past? Is the future that decides the past?

So the past creates structures , rigid structures that can lead experience in the present and from there , from the present , rewrite the codes to create another future. In the eighth dimension , the first time is future , not the past. In the eighth dimension , the future is the one that decides the past. This is why naturally in order to know where we go , we have to know from where we come from.

The present is the moment where I can use the tools that I have created in order to build a new future. As you see , the linear tempo , the linear time , is impossible to be lived here. The only moment where you live , the linear time , as we have proceeded , now is here. But the whole rest does n't have a line.

So let 's understand something that I wrote today in the blog.

So we have the eternal , the future , the present and the past. Do you remember that yesterday we explained that this is like a flower?

So if we have the flower in the center , the future will be the perfume , the smell of the flower. The essence that you can perceive that you can feel. The beans from the future will take from this flower , the eternity that we know as nectar.

Remember that nectar means death , but those who drive the nectar , lost , they became immortal.

So from this flower , the people from the future , takes the nectar and the pollen of the seventh dimension.

Remember the bees of consciousness coming here.

So what do the consciousness bees do in the present? They experiment creating things with the nectar and the pollen. With this products and experience that they have in the present , what do they do? The beans from the future , they create the past.

What is the past? The structures , the patterns of the reality and that 's the behalf with all this geometry , the elegance , the behalf , they create that and they create the honey.

So now I have two presents , the present that I live here and the present that I live around here. During my present , I processed all the past , I create the past and then I had another moment of present where I receive the products of the past. The bees from here , from the past , they bring also the pollen to the flower , so the flower can create many more.

## Energy Work

So the flower can expand , can create much roots and blossom in the next spring.

So the eighth dimension is talking about , is talking about about this process , but not only from one being , but for all the billions and thousands and trillion of beings of every molecule atom of entire universe.

So the difference with the fourth dimension , is that the fourth dimension only has one line of time of one being , the length of the appearance , but in the eighth dimension is all of them together , the billions and trillion of beings , fast , present and future of all , of everything that exists , is there. This is why to the eighth dimension , we usually know it as the registry , the roots of all , the buffer database of entire universe. And that 's what we saw on the you may call the Dash Records. Alaska in Sanskrit means light.

So Asahi records means the records , the registry of all the light.

So remember , we have light here in the center , shining , all is the data of that light. Hmm? In times we used to call this the great spider , Mania.

So the eighth dimension is where everything is registered. Everything. Pass , present , future , the story of our spirit , the story of our soul , the story of our , and you have each power , everything is there , is the matrix.

So now in this turn here , we have the future , is the essence that the present is the sense and the past is the experience.

So in this process , the eighth dimension is the one that the science all exists through the essence. As an example , we can say that the essence is a perfume. And that perfume must be smell.

So that 's the sense smell. And the experience is too smell. It 's the bird.

So the essence is a color. The sense is the side. And the expense is to see.

So in this way , we can tell that the eighth dimension is this essence , this perfume , that designs the senses in order to be able to perceive itself , to experience itself. From the poetic point of view , the essence here is the perfume of a flower that needs to be filled , spelled in order to bring the pollen to create more flowers.

So the example of the flower is good to understand why the perfume of a flower is the reason why the plant exists , because they would n't be flower or plants if they do n't have the essence that attract the experience. This is why the time designs the space. Time is the key to design everything that exists.

So in another way , a little bit more cold , we can say that the essence is the mathematics. The sense is geometry. And the experience is reality.

So the reality does n't exist without geometry. And the geometry does n't exist with math.

So there you have for the poetic people and the mathematicians , the logic people.

So in the eighth dimension is where we find the universal data , the entire information of existence. Of course , that this is much more complex and big , but it 's a dimension that you can not explain physically.

So that 's why I 'm trying to find the exact pulse for you to get it in a human way , which are not exactly like that , but it 's impossible to see the whole thing.

## Daily Practice Elements

So I hope you can catch it. The vibration for today is LO. The statement for today is I am love that enlighten. The goal for today is half.

The next cosmic attribute is the one that emerges from realizing what the being has inside. Everything that lays within and that can take outside. Having is the cosmic attribute of the being that recognizes the tools that has an expresses , an expresses the difficult faculty , sorry , of valign what is intrinsic to us and what can we get? Those gifts.

This way , the being says , I have referring to everything that this covers within itself and what can be obtained by its own creation. Let 's go to the limit. See the comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing. I take a deep breath.

Becoming aware of the place where I am and I use my imagination to expand it towards the infinite and perceive how the world is vanish in eternity. As I stay in the center floating in the void of the cosmos , the world is I remember the light that I have been the light that expands like rainbow all around in every direction. I remember that I am the potential that gives origin to all my times and spaces that I am my past , present , and future. And I observe all my life in front of me.

I try to remember to bring the memories to images since the moment I was born , throughout my childhood , teenagehood and adulthood. I perceive that I am close to death. I feel that close to me. And I see my entire life.

I pass him by in front of my eyes. Take the deep breath in that instant of death. Take the deep breath in my hands. In the middle of lights and darkness.

I let go all my life. I dare. Drink the death instead of running from it , allowing the death to tourism me in my own light. And to the darkness you , into the nectar that made me immortal.

And by being immortal I expand my eternity. From my eternity I expand the future without any limits , above , around my sides , the present , and under the love I absorb as it is. Going back to the core to the eternity. I repeat once again this process.

I recognize that it is not anymore only my life that goes in front of my eyes. It is all of them all around the past lives , present lives , parallel lives. The future once , all of them , creating the torus around me. All the life from every dimension , every timeline , every space , all of it.

The expand and contract once again in the torus coming back to the core to the eternity. I am the origin of all time and all space. My and the essence of existence. The future once , all of them , creating the torus around me.

The future once , all of them , creating the torus around me. The future once , all of them , creating the torus around me. The future once , all of them , creating the torus around me. The future once , all of them , creating the torus around me.

The future once , all of them , creating the torus around me. I am the love that lighten. I am the love that lighten. I am the love that lighten.

I am the netherdeer of kindness. I believe. I believe. I believe.

I believe. I see a star to expand this consciousness all through your body. Thank you everybody for being here as always. I am here tomorrow at the same time.
