## Overview

On December 30th, we arrive at the feet—the ankles chakra—in the physical aspect of the Sagittarius month. Tomorrow is the last day of Sagittarius and also the last day of 2020 according to the Gregorian calendar.

Matias notes this is the first New Year he'll spend alone, celebrating only during the alignment with all of us and some friends online. But he also warns us to be prepared: January 1st begins with Capricorn energy. Sorry to the water, air, and fire signs—but we begin 2021 working. Capricorn is about structures, hard work, and karma coming back to show us if we're able to face what we've worked on before.

Today, we explore the feet—the ankles and the water element. The feet represent the path, the way, but not just the road where you move. It's about every step you give that is registered and recorded within your own body. The feet are related to purpose, mission, the places where you go, and what you choose.

## Core Teaching

### The Difference Between Knees and Feet

Yesterday, the knees were related to the history and memories of all our ancestors. The feet, however, are related to the steps that I or we ourselves have given and stored for ourselves in our path.

The knees hold the history of those who came before. The feet hold the history of what we ourselves have created, experienced, and walked through.

This is why the feet are related to life—life as what we experience, what we have created for ourselves. It is what we are. When we speak about life and the feet, it's because we live a process of evolution and we walk through that process, going ahead, moving forward.

### What Is Life?

What is life from the point of view of mind and water?

Life would be like this concept that holds all the ideas of everything that has energy, that everything is continuous, and so on. But when we go into the physical aspect, life is related to not only the movement and transformation, but also with the element that allows life to exist—this individual separated from one another, changing information.

**That's why life is related to water. Water is life.**

We usually say that life is not possible without water, that we need water in order to have life. But that's not really like that. What really happens is that **water is life.**

Life doesn't need water. Water IS life.

### Everything That Vibrates Is Life

When we say life is water, we also have to remember that from the point of view of the universe, everything that vibrates is life.

We have organic and inorganic beings:
- **Inorganic** beings are like stones, the mineral kingdom. They also have life because they vibrate.
- **Organic** beings are those that can transform and interact with one another to create new compositions and structures constantly. They're moving, flowing constantly. That's why it's organic.

And those organisms are the ones that we used to call "living beings" because they move.

### Organic and Inorganic Are the Same

If we think about this, what we call organic and inorganic are not different things. They are the same thing because we living beings are made up with minerals.

We are alive because we have carbon, magnesium, calcium, iron, silicon, hydrogen, oxygen. We have so many minerals inside that we usually find in stones, rocks, and mountains. But we have them organized in a different way—in a way that's flexible.

They are moving. They interact in a different way because of water. **Water is the one that helps inorganic structures to become organic.**

That means they can move, they can flow, they can transform their shapes, they can adapt to the environment.

### Water: The Flexible Element

Because of water—because of this flexible element that can conform itself in different three states—it helps the minerals to interact with each other in different ways.

Life is basically the interaction of the minerals, which are inorganic. So we can understand that **life is basically inorganic minerals (inorganic elements) that are structured in an organic way.**

Basically, water is the element, the mineral element, that helps the inorganic to structure themselves, to organize themselves in living organisms.

### How Life Began on Earth

The reason why it happened here on Earth—why the inorganic started to become organized (organic)—is because of the heat of the volcanoes under the water.

The submarine volcanoes create a lot of heat. When you don't have water, this heat just goes away because the lava kills everything around, melts everything. But when you have water, the water starts to heat up.

It allows the minerals to interact and not to melt, not to be decomposed. The water allows these organisms, these minerals, to interact and to earn and save energy.

Being in the water, it helps this energy to be stored. That's why they create this membrane of sugars and salts. It starts to create this membrane that we call a **cell.**

### From Cells to Multicellular Life

These elements are the ones that start to be organized in some way to create a unicellular organism. This cell is the one that starts to divide itself into many other cells, creating multicellular organisms—multicellular organisms as we are.

This wouldn't be possible without water, which allowed the creation of these unicellular organisms.

When water arrived at this planet, it was the last key to help this world use the minerals from this world in order to create life. **Water is the key of life because basically water IS life.**

### Water Is Extraterrestrial

Remember: **water is not from this planet. Water is an extraterrestrial being.**

Water is not an element from the Earth. Water is an extraterrestrial element. It's from outside this planet. It's an extraterrestrial being.

Water is one of the most difficult elements to be created because it's impossible to replicate water. Water is always the same, and it's all over the universe exactly the same as water. Because you need so much energy to create the fusion to make the molecules of water, it could only have been created at the very beginning of everything.

The creation of water is one of the most incredible things of the universe. **Water is always water.** You cannot change it into another thing. It's always water.

Sometimes it's ice in solid shape, sometimes it's liquid, sometimes it's gas. But it's all over the universe being water—on the rings of Saturn, on some other moons as ice in Jupiter. It's traveling all around galaxies through comets and asteroids. It's everywhere. Water is everywhere.

### Water Came to Earth from Space

How it arrived on Earth? Through impacts of comets and asteroids. They brought water to this planet. So water is an alien. It's an extraterrestrial being.

We are made basically of water, so we are basically extraterrestrial. We come from the stars. Our bodies are made of minerals from the Earth, but the element that allows those minerals to interact and create life—that element is from outside the planet.

### The Oceans and Seas as the Feet

The oceans and seas represent the ankles and feet of the planet. They are the foundation, the path, the way we move through life.

The polar regions—Antarctica and the Arctic—are the most important water reservoirs. They hold the memory of water, the ancient ice that has traveled through space and time.

Just as the feet carry us forward on our path, the oceans carry the planet through its evolutionary journey. Every wave, every current, every molecule of water is a step in the planet's mission.

### Walking the Sky

The statement "I Am the Walker of Sky" reveals a profound truth: water came from the sky, from space, from the cosmos. We walk on Earth, but we are made of the sky. We are celestial beings walking a terrestrial path.

The feet touch the ground, but they carry the memory of the stars. The oceans rest on the ocean floor, but they came from comets and asteroids, from the depths of space.

We walk the sky because we ARE the sky, temporarily walking on Earth.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, drink water consciously. Recognize that every sip is an extraterrestrial element entering your body, organizing your minerals, giving you life. Feel your feet on the ground and recognize that every step you take is recorded in your body, in your path, in your mission. You are walking the sky on Earth.

### Applying This Teaching

Reflect on the path you've walked. What steps have you taken? What have you created for yourself? Your feet hold the memory of your choices, your purpose, your mission. Unlike your knees (which hold ancestral memory), your feet hold YOUR memory. What path are you creating? What mission are you walking?

## Q&A

### Q: What is the difference between the knees and the feet?

The knees hold the history and memory of our ancestors—everyone who made it possible for us to be here. The feet hold the steps that we ourselves have taken, the path we ourselves have created. Knees = ancestral history. Feet = personal mission and path.

### Q: How is water "life" if stones also have life because they vibrate?

Everything that vibrates has life in the universal sense. But organic life—life that moves, adapts, transforms, interacts—requires water. Water allows inorganic minerals to organize themselves into organic structures (cells, organisms). So water is the bridge between inorganic vibration and organic, adaptive life.

### Q: How did water create the first cells?

Submarine volcanoes heated the water, which allowed minerals to interact without melting. The water helped these minerals store energy and create a membrane of sugars and salts—the first cell. This unicellular organism then divided, creating multicellular life. Water made all of this possible.

### Q: Why is water considered extraterrestrial?

Water is not from Earth. It arrived on our planet through comets and asteroids that impacted Earth billions of years ago. Water is incredibly difficult to create—it requires so much energy that it could only have been created at the very beginning of the universe. So all water is ancient and comes from space. We are literally made of stardust and cosmic water.

### Q: Can water ever be destroyed or changed into something else?

No. Water is always water. It can change states—ice (solid), liquid, or gas (water vapor)—but it remains H₂O. You cannot change water into another substance. This is one of the most remarkable things about water: it's eternally itself, traveling through the universe unchanged.

### Q: What does "I Am the Walker of Sky" mean?

Water came from the sky (from space). We are made mostly of water. Therefore, we are celestial beings—made of the sky—walking on Earth. Our feet touch the ground, but our essence is cosmic, extraterrestrial, celestial. We walk the Earth, but we carry the cosmos within us.

### Q: How do the oceans represent the feet of the planet?

Just as our feet carry us on our path and record every step we take, the oceans carry the planet through its evolutionary journey. The polar regions (Antarctica and the Arctic) are the water reservoirs, holding ancient ice that remembers the cosmos. The oceans are the foundation and the path of planetary life.

### Q: What is our mission related to the feet?

The feet represent purpose, mission, the places we go, and what we choose. Every step we take is recorded in our body. Our mission is to walk consciously, knowing we are walkers of sky on Earth. We are here to bring celestial consciousness into terrestrial form, one step at a time.
