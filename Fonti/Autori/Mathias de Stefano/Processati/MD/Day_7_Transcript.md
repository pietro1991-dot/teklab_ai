today is I am the portal of life the task of today of course is just for those who are not doing the meditations right so you know to do in just five minutes along the day if you're not able to to connect to these meditations alignments the information of today the code of today is inhaling in the process of integration the code says says it's time to go inside analyze meditate find A New Perspective it stops amazing it stopped Amazing by the external world starts to find Limited finite goes to the inner World finds infinite with with an endless number of new possibilities and inspires itself in the military in the imagination this means once we we had go through the process of experimentation by inhaling contemplating exhaling we are going to do is the process of the integration what happens is the universe starts to recognize everything he has experienced it has experience it's it's like limited it needs to find a purpose to in the elimination Within this is the information we are going to have today through process remember today we are going to work with the anchoring in the root chakra is is the final product is the anchoring of the spirit today I I I have written about the child the the root chakra represents one of the main things we have to have very present today is the information everything the spirit is not someone willing to go into the spiritual world the spirit is the spiritual world what he is it is willing to do is to download to come be born live an experience in the matter we have to remember the root chakra the energy of the root chakra is the one allows the allows the spirit to come to reality to live reality to Anchor this is is important to to have in count the energy of the root this is it's important the process the importance of the genitals in the process of Illumination we have to understand this is not the chakra from we want to escape is the chakra we want to Anchor to be having in our minds today we're going to download the information of the IM into the root chakra please as always I ask you to I will put the music ask you to concentrate in we are going to do I was answering a question to Anchor energy today I don't know what I did to Anchor energy today we have to remember we are anchoring the I am into the and in the present in our body that's the goal of everything to be coherent to download information Here Now another thing is someone asked about the donations to do to make donations just for you to know if you want to make some donations or wherever please to the foundation both foundations you put money it goes to YouTube it doesn't go to me maybe in three months they will give me a one dollar or ten cents so that's the system we are not putting the people from from YouTube explain us so it doesn't worth it okay someone was asking about I was having like I don't know to say in English I was finishing some channelings the other days this is the energy someone channels usually it goes to the to the plexus it is like materialized like the energy when the energy goes up it's release energy is released like in a physical physical way that's it feels like let's go to the alignment we set our bodies comfortable I look for a comfortable position as I massage my body carries my body thank you I discharged the energy stretching yawning when I feel already comfortable start to relax let the weight of my arms my shoulders my hands it all fell down relaxing I focus only in my breathing I just read someone saying it gives me fear or I'm scared if you are scared don't do it don't do it with fear just let it live it for another time I breathe in deep hold the air breathe out softly through the nose I go with my oxygen through the lungs the heart all my blood towards each organ muscle of my body foreign observable I recognize part of my body to pay attention to I observe it feel it I breathe in very deep bringing all my energy oxygen towards part of my body I've become aware of the part of my body I feel more hot on the parts of my body I feel more cold foreign the hottest part of my body are the ones have more energy more emotion those are called they don't have much energy I allow myself with no judgments to received feel the first emotion comes to me from hottest part of my body foreign very deep recognizing emotion integrating it without judgments now I take the first thought crossed through my mind no judgment it can be something silly I breathe in very deep idea I recognize it I accept it with my hands or my imagination I will take part of my body his emotion this thought as if they are three little spheres I bring them in front of my genitals I observe the three spheres without thinking much I just allowed the idea of these three are together comes to me I breathe in narrative idea foreign these three are the tools my higher self has chosen for me today to nourish the seed of my root chakra without judgment I take with my hands or my imagination these three spheres put them inside my genitals I take a moment to be aware of all the traumas all the restrictions I did to repress the energy of my root chakra of my vital energy it's my Sexual Energy I recognize all the strength is within me that I am not allowing it to go out I take a deep breath acknowledging so if I feel ready I imagine I feel the light of the I am above my head I imagine the light of the I am coming down through my crown third eye throat hard plexus sacrum being aware is the spirit the one decided to become Here Now who I am I allow the light of the I am to go inside my genitals observe feel Delight of the I am starts to dissolve the three spheres as the seed of the root chakra starts to absorb the energy of these three download the energy of the I am acknowledge Him you can handle your own energy I can I can I feel the roots of seed growing towards my legs feet I feel its energy Thurman the energy of the I am the power of the I am I start to ReSound a size C the flower starts to Blossom in my root chakra a beautiful red flower as I pronounce the vibration foreign the best I feel activating flower foreign take a deep breath take a deep breath assigned to it I

to be scared we are going through some of our own fears remember fear is a tool of survival we feel fear something is changing fear is someone it's something is trying to protect us from being from change we can die in change if you feel a lot of fear you just stop do it in another moment if you want to keep going even if you feel fear just think about fear as a tiny person is trying to help you as much as he can't just hug fear imagine you are hacking fear with your light go down bringing the light down into the ground okay rest see you tomorrow at the same time as always thank you for being
