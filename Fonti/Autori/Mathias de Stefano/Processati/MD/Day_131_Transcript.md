# Day 131 - Feeling and the Crown Chakra

**Author:** Matias de Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** Day 131 Transcript - Sagittarius Month, Crown Chakra, Emotional Week (recorded from Egypt Pyramids)

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Crown
- **Week Theme:** Emotional Week - Sagittarius Month
- **Main Topic:** Feeling and Sentiment
- **Vibration:** Va
- **Statement:** I am the universal Legacy
- **Code:** Truncated Icosahedron - cutting vertices from icosahedron creates 32 faces (20 hexagonal, 12 pentagonal), 90 edges, 60 vertices. This configuration forms the planetary grid of consciousness (like a soccer ball), revealing directions of cosmic consciousness through inner observation and constant external observation. Originates the pattern that incarnates the Third Eye chakra.

## Overview

Today's teaching comes from inside the pyramids of Egypt during a three-day journey. We receive the second gift from the pyramids - the gift of being "incense" (in-sense), which means to be fully present in our senses. We explore the true nature of darkness and light, understanding that darkness is not evil but the structure that allows light to manifest in matter. We learn how feelings and sentiments store the information received through our five senses, and why living fully present in our senses is the key to downloading the Divine into matter.

## Context: Inside the Pyramids - Second Kingdom

The group is continuing their three-day journey inside the pyramids of Giza. Today they visited Khafre's pyramid and received messages about the **Second Kingdom - the Kingdom of the Soul**.

The gift received today: **To be incense** - a play on words meaning "in-sense" - to be fully present in the senses.

## The Message from Darkness and Light

### Two Wings Balancing the Soul

Today the group received messages from two different Wings:
- **One from Darkness**
- **One from Light**

Both were balancing the energy of the soul system they were working with.

### Darkness: The Designer of Reality

The Dark One explained something profound:

**"Even though reality, everything is based in light and love - that's the essence, the things within existence - the shapes, the structures are created by the Distortion of that light."**

All things that exist in matter are **designed by the darkness**. Darkness doesn't mean something bad - it means **those who create, manifest, and transform reality to be what it is**.

Everything we see beautiful in this world - the beauty of nature, the beauty of this reality we experience - was also created by the darkness.

### The Dark One's Teaching: Be Responsible for Your Darkness

**In order to awake our light, what we have to do is to be responsible of our Darkness - the one that we have created.**

## Understanding Darkness and Light

### Darkness Surrounds Light

Darkness is the one that is around the light.

Every one of us has like a **seed of light** - a seed of energy that is positive, which is the **essence of the being**. The essence is inside each one of us.

Because it's positive, by **polarity and magnetism**, it attracts the negative to it.

**All the things that are negative are creating like a crust around this seed.**

This crust is made with:
- Low emotions
- Sadness
- Suffering
- Hunger
- Rage
- All this dark side that surrounds the positive aspect

### Finding the Essence Behind Darkness

What the Dark One said:

**"If you are looking for the essence of your being, what you have to do is to look for that darkness that you have inside, because you will find that Essence behind it."**

**The essence is positive, so it attracts all the negative around to create a crust.**

**This is why to be responsible is to understand and to face that darkness that is around my light.**

## The Laws of the Universe

Once we find the essence and become aware, we can change the system, change our reality, create.

**How can you create from the darkness?**

The darkness basically is the **laws of the universe**. All the laws that structure the reality are made by the darkness.

### The Nine Laws

Matias lists the laws (which will be explored during Capricorn month):

1. **Mentalism**
2. **Correspondence**
3. **Vibration**
4. **Rhythm**
5. **Cause and Effect**
6. **Polarity**
7. **Generation**
8. **Matrix** (added)
9. **Purpose** (added)

All these laws are the **structures that create the matter**. Matter is basically the way in which the light is assimilated.

### Conscious vs. Unconscious Use

**If we are unconscious and unaware**, darkness controls us. We are used by the system.

**If we are responsible and conscious** about our own creation, our own reality, then darkness cannot do anything to us. We can handle the laws of the Universe through consciousness.

## The Five Senses: Vehicles of Light

Two weeks ago, the teaching covered the **five ways in which matter absorbs the data of light** - the **five senses**:

1. **Taste**
2. **Touch**
3. **Hearing**
4. **Vision**
5. **Smell**

These five are the vehicles through which **light will be assimilated in the shadows**.

**These five are basically illusions that make a translation of light towards our inner world.**

### The Gift of Incense: Being In-Sense

What the Dark One said:

**"If these are the five tools to understand the light, if we are willing to download the Divine into the matter to live properly here, what we have to do is to live fully present in our senses."**

They called this **the gift of incense** (like the frankincense gift).

**"To be incense"** - to be **in-sense**.

From the point of view of Darkness, this is their gift for us: **to be able from the Shadows to perceive the light**.

## Feeling vs. Sentiment vs. Emotion

### The Senses Don't Store Information

The senses are just the tools to perceive the light. But the senses do not storage the information they receive.

**How do we storage information? Through energy.**

That energy we call **emotional**.

### Three Key Distinctions

**1. EMOTION**

An emotion is a **reaction** - a chemical reaction of your body according to an energetical pulse provoked by something in the outside.

- Something happens outside
- It pushes an energy
- That makes your body react
- Organs start to create hormones
- We perceive these as emotions

**Emotion is provoked by the outside towards the inside. It is momentaneous - for a while.**

**2. SENTIMENT / FEELING**

A sentiment or feeling is the **storaging of data from all the feelings you receive through the senses**.

You have like a **notebook of all that data**, ready to activate just in case something similar happens.

**A sentiment or feeling is something that you activate from within towards the outside.**

It's like a **library** - it holds information for a long, long time.

**3. THE KEY DIFFERENCE**

- **Emotion**: Outside → Inside (temporary reaction)
- **Sentiment/Feeling**: Inside → Outside (stored data, long-term)

### Feelings Can Be Inherited

A sentiment, a feeling, can be **inherited from generation to generation** because they get **recorded in your cells**.

The sentiment, the feeling, is like the **book**, the **registry**, the **records** of all the things that our senses have perceived.

Through sentiments, through feelings, we can understand how our bodies and our whole history (our tree of life) have been receiving this information through the story.

## Living Fully Present

**In order to be aware of all the things that we have within, we have to start to live more aware and fully present in our body.**

We need to **open the books of our feelings** to understand them.

This way we can understand **how we have been receiving the codes of light through the senses**.

## Guided Meditation: The Universal Legacy

The meditation journey connects us to our evolutionary path through the senses:

1. Focus on breathing, always through the nose
2. Press and caress the tip of your fingers, feeling the nerves
3. Listen to the sounds around - the animals
4. Touch with the tip of your fingers, take a look
5. Perceive they are not your hands - they are hands of a hominid
6. See yourself as orangutan/chimpanzee, walking with four legs
7. Reach the limits of the forest, see the Savannah
8. Remember touching and grabbing the tree, turning to stand on two feet
9. See others like you seated on the floor
10. One extends hands to give you a rock
11. Feel the motion of running through animals, reaching the next tree
12. Under the tree, another hominid stands straight - you give him the rock
13. Recognize yourself receiving the same rock again
14. Run to the mountains, to the other side, until you see the coast, the ocean
15. With feet on water, see a human - give him this rock
16. Become the human taking the rock, jumping into water, taking a boat
17. Cross the sea to the other side
18. Find another human waiting to take this rock
19. This human is all dressed up - become this human
20. Cross a big desert until you find a beautiful valley with a long river
21. Approach the river, find a village
22. Deliver this rock to an agriculture, a farmer
23. Bend to the ground, and with the seeds, sow this rock
24. The farmer smiles, singing to this rock, knowing they are sowing **the pillar of all Humanity**
25. **Recognize: I am the same farmer that seeded the basis of humanity**
26. **I am the same hominid that brought the seed for this Humanity**
27. **I am the universal Legacy**

All history lives here and now within me. We can see the history, for it lives in my soul.

Touch the tip of your fingers again, realizing about the Legacy that is my body.

Recognize that all my sentiments, my feelings, were born in this first emotion of standing still, watching the horizon outside the forest.

Touch and caress the body, thanking that first human community, telling it that it accomplished its mission - that it reached until myself here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Practice being "incense" - fully present in your senses for at least one meal today. Taste every bite consciously. Feel the texture. Smell the aromas. See the colors. Hear the sounds of eating. Notice what feelings (stored data) arise from these sense experiences.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel a strong emotion, pause and ask:
1. Is this coming from outside (emotion - temporary reaction)?
2. Or is this coming from inside (sentiment - stored data from past experiences)?
3. What is this feeling trying to teach me about how I've received light through my senses?

Practice taking responsibility for your darkness by asking: "What structures (thoughts, beliefs, patterns) have I created that are forming a crust around my essence?"

## Q&A

### Q: How can darkness be beautiful if we're taught it's bad or evil?

Darkness is not evil. Darkness is the **designer of reality** - the structures, shapes, and forms that allow formless light to manifest. Think of darkness like a sculptor's hands shaping clay, or an architect's blueprint creating a building. Without darkness providing structure, light would have no way to express itself in matter. The beauty of nature - trees, mountains, rivers, your body - these are all darkness giving shape to light.

### Q: What does it mean to "be responsible for our darkness"?

Being responsible for your darkness means acknowledging that YOU create the structures, patterns, and beliefs that surround your essence. You are not a victim of external darkness - you are the creator of the crust around your light. When you take responsibility, you stop being controlled by unconscious patterns and start consciously working with the laws of the universe to create your reality.

### Q: If darkness controls us when we're unconscious, how do we become conscious?

By living fully present in your senses - being "incense." When you are aware of what you taste, touch, hear, see, and smell, you are downloading Divine light into matter consciously. You become aware of how you're receiving information, how you're storing it as feelings, and how those feelings create your reality. Consciousness comes from presence in the now, in the body, in the senses.

### Q: What's the practical difference between emotion and feeling?

**Emotion** is like a wave that hits you from outside - someone insults you, your body reacts with anger chemicals. It's temporary.

**Feeling/Sentiment** is like a deep ocean current - it's stored data from all your past experiences. When someone insults you and you feel rage, that rage is pulling from your stored library of all the times you've been hurt before. Feelings can last for years or lifetimes because they're recorded in your cells.

### Q: Why are feelings inherited? How does that work?

Feelings are stored as energy patterns in your cells. When your parents conceive you, you inherit not just their DNA but also the energetic imprints of their stored feelings. This is why you might have fears or reactions that don't seem to come from your own life experience - they're from your ancestral line. This is the cellular memory, the "books" of feelings passed down through generations.

### Q: How do I "open the books of my feelings" to understand them?

Pay attention to what triggers strong reactions in you. Each trigger is pointing to a "book" - a stored record of past sense experiences. Ask yourself: "When did I first feel this?" "What did I see, hear, taste, touch, smell when this pattern was created?" "What is this feeling trying to teach me?" By consciously exploring your reactions, you read the books and understand how you've been receiving light through your senses throughout your entire evolutionary history.

### Q: What does it mean that we are the "universal Legacy"?

You are the culmination of billions of years of evolution. Every hominid that stood on two legs, every human that crossed deserts and seas, every farmer that planted seeds - they all live within your cells, your feelings, your senses. You are not separate from them. You ARE them, experiencing themselves now through you. The entire history of consciousness lives within you, stored in your feelings, accessible through your senses.

### Q: If the five senses are "illusions," why should we be fully present in them?

The senses are illusions in that they translate light into forms we can perceive - they don't show us the whole truth, just one dimensional slice of it. But they are also the ONLY tools we have to download Divine light into matter while we're in physical form. Being fully present in these "illusions" is how we consciously receive light instead of unconsciously being controlled by darkness. It's the difference between watching a movie knowing it's a movie (conscious) vs. thinking the movie is reality (unconscious).

**Reflection:** We stand at a threshold moment in the pyramids, receiving the second gift - the gift of the senses as divine instruments. We learn that darkness is not our enemy but our designer, the sacred structure-maker that allows formless light to dance in matter. Every emotion we feel, every sensation we experience, is light being translated through the generous illusions of our five senses. And deeper still, every feeling we carry is a book written by our ancestors, a library of light stored in our cells, waiting to be read with conscious awareness. We are not separate beings stumbling through a dark world - we are the universal Legacy itself, all of history alive in this present moment, learning to be "incense," to be fully in-sense, to be responsibly present in the sacred structures we ourselves have created. This is how we awake the light: not by fighting darkness, but by taking responsibility for it, by understanding it, by recognizing that we are both the light essence at the center and the darkness crust around it, eternally dancing together in the miracle of existence.
