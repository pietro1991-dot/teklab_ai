# Day 131 - Guided Meditation

## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon , everyone. Just to let you know for all the new ones that when people comes we are working every day and many hours and all the time together and we some of us awake at 3 a.

## Guided Meditation

M. In the morning and then we are doing stuff until now that we finish the meditation at 9. 30 at night.

So of course that you may understand that I want to make it short because of course I am really tired. We are all all are and there is an why I usually speak more when I am alone because I do n't do anything and basically I am very relaxed during that so that 's why I talk and talk.

So first of all let 's go to the topic for today related to what happened today in the pyramid? The pyramid today we went to Kéweren and and the gift we received for everyone there as a message was related to the second kingdom which is the kingdom of the soul. The topic for today is feeling or also sentiment , you may call it. And the gift that we received today to share with everyone is to be in sense.

So like the frankincense that one of the kings gift as a gift but playing with the words saying in sense like the second gift but to be in sense , to be fully present in the senses that what what in mind.

So today we have received the messages from two different beings , one from the darkness and the other one from the light and they were balancing the energy of the soul of the system that we were working with.

So the Darwin was someone that explained very straight to the point where we have to learn from today and one of the main things that I want to share is that we have to remember that even the reality everything is based in light and love. That 's the essence of it. The things that are within the existence but the shapes , the structures are created by the distortion of that light.

So all the things that exist in the matter they are designed by the darkness and darkness not thinking about not thinking about something bad but those who create to manifest and to transform the reality to be what it is.

So it says that everything that we see beautiful in this world , the beauty of nature , the beauty of this reality that we experience was also created by the darkness.

So what the Darwin was trying to say is that in order to to awake our light when we have to do is to be responsible of our darkness , the one that we have created.

So the message was also related to to be aware that darkness is the one that is around the light. And this means that this is basically that every one of us has like a seed of light , like a seed of energy that is positive which is the essence of the being.

So the essence is inside each one of us and because it 's positive by polarity and by magnetism attracts the negative to it.

So all the things that are negative are creating like a crust around this seed. And this crust is made with the low emotions , with sadness , with suffering , with hunger , with rage , and all this this dark side that we have that surrounds this positive aspect.

So what the the dark one said is if you are looking for the essence of your being , what you have to do is to look for that Darwin 's that you have inside because you will find that essence behind it because the essence is positive.

So attract all the negative around to create a crust.

So this is why to be responsible is to understand and to face that darkness that is around my light.

So this was all about responsibility because this means that in order to in order to awake the potential that we have within the positive aspect of the essence , we have to know how to use that darkness because once that we find the essence , we are able to change the system to change our reality to create a little worry. It was an echo of mine.

So it can create , you can create your own reality about that from that darkness.

## Practice Structure

So how can you create from that from the darkness? Well , the darkness basically is the loss of the universe. All the laws that the structure of the reality are made by the darkness.

So all that darkness is the one controlling us when we are unaware.

Okay , and when we become conscious , when we become aware , then we can transform that reality.

So we can handle the loss of the universe by consciousness. The darkness , usually , we feel that is bad because the system of the darkness use us when we are not responsible. If we are responsible and conscience about our own creation , our own reality , so darkness can not do anything. But if we are unaware , so they just can use it , can use us as they want.

Okay , if you ask what are the laws of the universe , I will say them , but I 'm not going to explain them because we are going to work with them during the month of Capricorn.

So the laws are mentality , correspondence , vibration , rhythm , cause and effect , polarity , generation , and I will add two more , which is matrix and purpose.

So what the dark one said is that all these laws are the structures that create the matter. And the matter is basically the way in which the light is assimilated.

So this means that we from the world of matter absorb and understand the patterns of light through the structures of darkness , which is matter.

So I hope that you remember what we have been talking about two weeks ago about the five ways in which the matter absorbed the data of the light , which are the five senses , just taste , hearing , vision , smell and touch.

So this five will be the vehicles through which the light will be assimilated in the shadows.

So this five are basically illusions that makes a translation of light towards our inner world. This five generate the senses in the physical aspect.

So what the dark said is that if this are the five tools to understand the light , if we are willing to download the divine into the matter to live properly here , what we have to do is to live fully present in our senses. What he said or he described like the gift of incense to be incense. They call this a gift because from the point of view of darkness , this is their gift for us to be able from the shadows to perceive the light.

So the senses are just the tools to perceive the light. But the senses did not , they do n't storage the information that they receive.

So how do we storage information through energy? And that energy we call it emotional.

So the way in which the emotional level storage the information of the senses is what we call by the feelings or the sentiments.

So first of all , what is the difference between feeling or sentiment with emotion?

So an emotion is a reaction , a chemical reaction of your body , according to an analytical pulse that is provoked by something in the outside.

So something happens outside that pushes an energy that makes a react your body and the organs starts to create this hormones that we perceive as emotions.

So what is the sentiment or feeling? It is the storage of data from all the feelings that you receive through the senses.

So you have like a notebook of all that data to activate it , just in case something similar happens.

So a feeling is something that you activate from within towards the outside.

So the difference would be that an emotion is something provoked by the outside towards inside and it is just moment tenuous , it 's for a while. And a sentiment or feeling is something that goes from within towards the outside and is like a library.

So it holds the information for a long , long time.

So an emotion can be something quick , a reaction , but a sentiment or feeling , they can be they can be inherited from generation to generation because they get recorded in your cells.

So it can become also a belief. The sentiment , the feeling is like the book , the registry , the records of all the things that our senses have perceived.

So through sentiments through feelings is how we can understand how our bodies and our all history of our tree of life have been receiving this information through the story.

So this is why in order to be aware of all the things that we have within , we have to start to live more aware and fully present in our body and open the books of our feelings to understand them.

So we could understand how we have been receiving the codes of light through the senses. This is why the gift that we received today , it was about to live fully present in our senses. That 's why they use this game of words with the incense , live incense. As I said , I was about to be straight to the point.

So if you want to know any more , go and read the blog.

So let 's go to the line and to the point.

## Daily Practice Elements

Today we begin with a new vibration. The vibration for today is Va , which is like blowing that same A B Va. The statement for today is I am the universal legacy. I 'm getting all the code for today is the term-cated icosahedron.

Counting the vertices of the icosahedron , we find 12 new faces. Having this way at total of 32 , the attention , 32 with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces , having 90 edges and 60 purchases. This configuration forms the figure of the planetary grid of consciousness , like a soccer ball that reveals the directions of cosmic consciousness equally , an inner observation and a constant external one for this originates the pattern that incarnates the third I-chagra. We focus in our breathing always by the nose.

Encarnates the tip of my fingers , filling the nerves on the tip of it. I 'll be attention to some surrounding animals. I 'll take a look into it and perceive that there are not my hands. They are the hands of a a minute like in the language and all cover in hair with my back curved , sitting on the other tree.

I am the first of all humanity. I see myself as an orangutan. In chimpanzee , walking with my four legs , reaching the limits of the forest as you see the banana and its animals.

Remember how you touch and grab the tree and just turned up into feet. Look back and watch others like you seated on the floor. I want them to extend its hands to give you a rock. Take your breath and feel the motion of running through the other animals in the savanna , reaching for the next tree in the horizon.

In front of you , under the tree , you will see another woman standing up straight. And you will give him this rock. Take your deep breath and I recognize myself receiving the same rock again.

So now I take the rock and start to run to the mountains and to the other side until I see the coast , the ocean. And with the feet on water , I can see a human. And I give him this rock. And I recognize myself as this human taking the rock jumping into the water and taking a boat to cross the sea to the other side.

There I can find another human waiting there to take this rock and the other side. This time this human is older up. And I find myself again crossing the big desert until I find the other side. A beautiful valley with a long river.

I approach to the river finding a village and I deliver this rock to a never culture to farm. I bend to the ground. And with the seats , I saw this rock.

Now this farmer smile singing to this rock knowing that he 's sewing the pillar of all humanity. And I recognize myself as this rock. Take a deep breath. I am the same farmer that sees it the basis of humanity.

I am the same homicide that brought the seed for this humanity. I am the universal legacy. And all this story lives here and now within me. I can see the history for it is in my soul.

And I start to touch the tip of my fingers again. I recognize that all my sentiments and feelings were born in this first emotion of standing still watching the horizon outside the forest. I am taking the breath. And I start to touch and carry the body.

Thinking that first human committed telling it , telling it that it accomplished its mission that it reached until myself here and now. And I can back here and now opening my eyes. Thank you everybody for being there. And this is how we begin our emotional wake of legacy.

So see you tomorrow at the same time and remember that tomorrow early in the morning we will be connecting from the great pyramid towards every one of the main notes of the planetary beat. See you tomorrow.
