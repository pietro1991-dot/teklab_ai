## Overview

On the fifteenth day of alignment, we work with the sacral chakra in the emotional week, focusing on one of the most difficult teachings of the entire series: understanding darkness as the distortion of light, not as an opposing force. This session challenges us to release judgment and cultivate compassion even for those who have committed the most terrible acts.

The vibration "Hy" combines "H" (life and history) with "Y" (representing gestation and the womb). Today's statement is "I Am the Generating Life," emphasizing the sacral chakra as the place where life is generated and where we absorb all the pain, beliefs, and emotions of our history.

This teaching is not easy to accept. We are asked to recognize that darkness is not an enemy to fight but a distortion of light that needs to be balanced. We learn that all beings—even those who commit atrocities—are acting from a place of survival and distortion. The path to healing is not through hatred or judgment but through compassion and forgiveness, setting ourselves and future generations free.

## Core Teaching

### Darkness as Distortion of Light

One of the most important things to understand from today's teaching is that darkness is not something against us. Darkness is not an opposing force to light. Darkness is just another creature, just another being that is evolving in this universe, as we all are. We cannot recognize the purpose of darkness until we face our own darkness, our own things we have within.

The main thing we need to understand is that we usually think darkness is something against the light, and it is not like that. **Darkness is not against light. Darkness is the distortion of light.**

This is something very important to understand. We as humans are used to thinking that everything is opposite, that everything is just opposite to each other—like positive and negative. No, they are not opposite. They are complementing. One of the main things that helps to understand this is that no forces in the universe are against each other. All the forces are complementary to each other.

The acknowledging of this will help us realize that we don't have to fight against anything. We just have to balance it.

### There Is No War to Fight

One of the things we have been doing lately, in this last period, is calling ourselves "warriors"—warriors of light, rainbow warriors. There is no war to fight. We are not warriors. We have not come for a different thing. All the things we have like fighting, like trying to survive, are just a human perspective. It's not the truth. It's just a human perspective of fighting, of trying to survive.

One of the things we fight for, or we are against each other, is that we fight to take control over the other ones. As I take control over the other ones, I want to expand my territory. The reason I want to expand my territory is that I want to have more things. I want to have things. I just want to have something to survive—like food. I don't want to die. Everyone who is fighting is basically fighting for survival.

There are many wars, not only on Earth but also in other constellations, other dimensions. Not all the wars are fought with guns or swords. It doesn't matter what war we are trying to fight. The last battle of all the battles is the one we have within, is with ourselves.

### The War Within: Light Fighting Itself

Of course, the only thing we have to fight for within is that war between our light and our darkness. As I said, the darkness is just the distortion of light. Basically, the war is the light fighting with itself in its different perspectives. **Darkness doesn't exist.** You don't need to find a balance between both of them. The darkness is just the light distorted.

When we go toward our darkness, we find that they are just potentials we had, but we had no idea how to use them properly.

### All Conflict is Unbalanced Potential

Any conflict, any war we have with ourselves within, with someone in our environment, or even the war between countries—they are just potentials that haven't been really worked properly. It's normal for us that we go into the path of evolution, getting even more confused. As we have more experiences, we gain more distortion. We lose the clarity.

Once we realize that every darkness we face in our lives is just our own light distorted, we just realize that to be free, we just need to look at our darkness, to recognize it, to honor it, and to let the light shine properly according to what the darkness made us.

We make ourselves free from all our history has brought us to believe—that there are good things and bad things. The truth is there are no things that are bad or good. There are only things unbalanced.

### The Most Important Job: Balance

The most important job we have in our lives is to work with ourselves to achieve balance. I know it's difficult to accept most of the times the most horrible facts and acts that used to happen in society. To accept the worst things that happen in our society, the horrible facts—of course, it's very difficult for us to understand why they happen.

The truth is there are no bad things by nature. It starts to be unbalanced by the experience. This is where our great possibility is—to try to bring back the balance.

### Facing Personal Darkness

The speaker shares: "I myself have lived many of the darkness things—demons, possessions, many things along my life. I faced the darkness. I know how they work. I know they exist. They have force.

But there was one day I just felt them. I experienced the acknowledging that they are a part of me. I cannot fight them. They are part of myself. I just talked to them, hugged them, and said, 'Thank you. I love you. Now I understand that you are just showing me a part of myself I couldn't see by myself.'

Since that moment, they don't bother me. I sometimes feel them, but they don't bother. They are myself."

### Fighting the Outside: Seeing Our Own Darkness

Then we have the other fight—fighting the outside. Sometimes it is easier than fighting the inside. It is to see your own darkness and how dark can you be to others. That's more difficult. It's very difficult to understand the darkness and how they work, watching them from the side of the light.

Our normal perspective is to think we are on the right side. I guess one of the best ways to understand how darkness and light work is to watch Planet Earth, the channel, or maybe some Discovery Channel.

### The Nature Documentary: No Good or Evil

According to what I said about watching nature: you see two stories in one documentary. One is the deer. You see how they grow up, how they are—you just love the deer, how they grow up. Also, you see the story of the lion, how the lion mother takes care of the child, of the lion cub. You love both of them. They have amazing stories. They are beautiful. You love both mothers.

Suddenly, one of the mothers fights the other one and eats the child—it's the deer. You just see everything. In the documentary, they show you everything—the blood, everything. Suddenly you say, "Who's the bad guy?" Because the cub was hungry. He was about to die if he wouldn't eat anything. The mother went to look for lunch.

**Who's the dark one?**

When you watch nature, you cannot just pretend that the thing we believe is something cruel is just an act of survival. That's all it is.

### All "Evil" is Survival and Distortion

The people that make terrible things—we say they are bad people. They are just trying to survive. I am also talking about murderers, rapists, tyrants, all the people we usually say they are bad people. They are all people who have suffered as kids, who have suffered, who were children, people who weren't able to feel love, to express their own truth, people who were hurt.

It's people who, in the subconscious, believe and think that hurting others is the way of love. This is one of the most difficult teachings.

### Even Jesus Taught Forgiveness

Even Jesus said, **"Forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing."** Every fact of evil is just a fact, a matter of distortion. This is what we are doing every day by the alignments—to try to balance, to align the distortion.

### Healing the Distortion in the World

In order to help these distortions in the world, with all these people that are distorted, we have to do is to start by our own distortion. I've seen many people asking about the Illuminati, the Cabal, the markers, and everyone. They were all kids who were hurt.

Our goal is not to fight against what happened. It's not to judge what happened. It is to heal ourselves. When we allow the future not to happen in the future, to be free from this, in order to make this possible in the future, we have to set ourselves free from the perception of fighting.

### Forgiving the Past, Loving the Future

We must forgive everyone in the past for everything they did and give love to the future's children so they don't have to go through the same things. It's very easy to put ourselves like judges of what is good and what is bad. It's not our task.

### The Difficult Work of Alignment

All that I am speaking is important to make the alignment. We are not here to make a beautiful meditation, whatever. We are here to work with this. What we are going to align is this.

There is no need to integrate or accept right now. We have a lot of time, a lot of thousands of years if you want. You will someday. There's no rush.

### Even the Darkest Must Be Forgiven

Someone asked, "Even the network of people doing pedophilia and eating children?" Yes, even them. Even them. If we are not recognizing that we are all one, that we are all the same, and we are not able to forgive, and we are hating someone, we are inheriting to our children in the future to hate someone.

This is one of the most difficult tasks ever. We call this **compassion**. This is the most difficult thing. This is what we are going to try to align.

### The Sacral Absorbs the Pain

The sacral chakra is the one that absorbs all the pain, all these beliefs, all these emotions. Remember, all darkness is just distortion of light. If I am light and I bring myself, the distortion stops.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Reflect on the darkness within yourself and recognize it as distorted light. Practice seeing the darkness in others—even those who have committed terrible acts—as distorted light rather than inherent evil. This does not mean condoning their actions; it means understanding the root of distortion and working to heal it within yourself first.

### Applying This Teaching

When you encounter something you perceive as "evil" or "bad," pause and ask: "What distortion is this? What unbalanced potential is at play here?" Practice compassion by recognizing that all beings, no matter how distorted, were once children who suffered. Forgive the past and focus on healing yourself so that future generations can be free.

## Q&A

### Q: How can darkness be the distortion of light and not an opposing force?

Darkness is not a separate entity fighting against light. It is light that has been distorted, twisted, or unbalanced through experience and survival. Just as a distorted mirror reflects light in a warped way, darkness is light expressing itself in an unbalanced form.

### Q: Does this mean there is no such thing as evil?

There are no things that are inherently bad or good by nature. There are only things that are unbalanced. What we perceive as evil is distortion—potentials that haven't been worked properly, often rooted in survival and suffering.

### Q: How can I forgive those who have committed terrible acts like murder or abuse?

Forgiveness does not mean condoning the actions. It means recognizing that these people were once children who suffered, who were hurt, and who learned distorted ways of expressing and receiving love. Forgiveness sets you free from hatred and breaks the cycle for future generations.

### Q: What about people who harm children—must I forgive them too?

Yes, even them. This is one of the most difficult teachings. If we are not recognizing that we are all one and we continue to hate, we pass that hatred to our children. Healing ourselves and forgiving the past is the only way to ensure future children are free from repeating these cycles.

### Q: How do I balance darkness within myself?

By looking at your darkness, recognizing it, honoring it, and understanding it is part of you. Talk to it, embrace it, and say, "Thank you. I love you. Now I understand you are showing me a part of myself I couldn't see." When you bring your light to it, the distortion stops.

### Q: Why is the sacral chakra the focus for this work?

The sacral chakra is the womb, the place where life is generated. It is also the place that absorbs all the pain, all the weight of emotions, beliefs, and suffering from our environment, family, and history. By working here, we transform pain into creative life force.

### Q: What if I can't accept this teaching right now?

There is no rush. You have a lot of time, thousands of years if you want. You will accept it someday. This is one of the most difficult teachings, and it's okay if you need time to process it.

### Q: What is compassion in this context?

Compassion is the ability to recognize that all beings—even those who have committed the worst acts—are suffering and distorted. It is the most difficult task, requiring us to see beyond judgment and into the root causes of pain and imbalance.
