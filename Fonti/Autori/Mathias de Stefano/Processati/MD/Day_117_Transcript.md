## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? When the years when I started this when I noticed Good morning , good afternoon Good evening Hi to all of you I think the signal is fine today , so I hope you are listening well So if you want to know how I 'm how am I?

## Daily Practice Elements

So today Down here , I 'm feeling fine But I am headache today , very headache and Well I have never had so much pain In every different parts of my body since I do n't know many time So I guess I do n't know , I 'm feeling older , I do n't know Or I have been working too much with my inner self This physical week , so so so I went so deep that I took everything out and that 's it So we only have three more days of Scorpio So let 's go to the for the topic for today , which is Pressure So when we speak about pressure most of us can Feel can can Peace that this is something that really hurts us that is really bad for us because we do n't like to leave on the pressure But the reality is that we are Constantly under pressure That reality itself exists because of pressure And this is why it 's important to understand To be aware of what pressure means in existence So we could know how to handle it and how to understand its purpose So the main image that we have to acknowledge to understand pressure is to go back as we have always picture the Origin of the universe the universe expressed itself , okay from within Towards the outside and when it does this It is the inner and the negative aspect aspect of the universe expressing itself outside to project in the positive And then the positive is willing to go back as the heartbeat towards the inside This means that the negative is looking for the positive outside and the positive is looking for the negative inside This creates what we call the magnetism magnetism where the positive and the negative are trying to Get together So the negative is trying to express in the outside and the positive is trying to integrate in the inside of the negative So when this happens the negative and the positive are trying to be together So they create like this friction that creates energy trying to much One between the other so with this they create a third force which is the creation itself This is why positive and negative are the polarity that helps the universe system these two these two Force this positive and negative are looking each other in order to integrate One trying to express the other one trying to integrate itself and this too By force by pressure they create the third aspect which is the creation itself so This pressure is the one that allows the universe to exist So this positive and negative the positive and the negative when they start to move Big ways of vibration so when this vibration starts to move faster and faster by Frequencies different frequencies it creates a particle and the particle is a conjunction of different Frequencies of different vibrations in In frequency okay Expressing frequencies so Okay There are many things in the middle of course , but let 's go to the most known of all which is when we have this particle We have This particle in negative and electron and then we have the proton as the positive So they attract each other in order to be Okay together This Particles starts to join together to try to find balance in between positive and negative Constantly trying to put all together Okay again To try to mix the energies with this energy they Different types of positive and negative in between the different atoms Creating Molecules and the molecules are the one starting to create Matter okay So these particles that creates atoms that creates molecules that creates chemicals The matter They also are the ones that will create the structures of reality that will create Then we 'll create The structures of life So the main four that we will have in order to talk about life will be Oxygen , nitrogen , hydrogen and carbon Those are the main four to create life So this four are just some of the most important But they are not only in our Body they are not only in our biological bodies they are in everything they are connected in They 're in in the stars in the sun and they are everywhere So to understand this these are the The main structures That where the sign and created When the energy was trying to press in the very beginning so in the very beginning all the pressure of all this positive and negative creating this Elements was so huge the pressure was such So huge That Immediately it created neutrality in the middle and exploded and that 's what we call the big bang The great explosion So basically the Energyical world Compress itself so much that give birth to the physical world So thanks to the pressure of the mental reality Applies the energyical reality and thanks to the pressure of the Energyical reality We have the physical reality So basically the universe Exist due to the pressure to the pressure of dimensions So all the dimensions Pressing the universe is the one creating the physical reality Imagine this we are vibration and energy that is being It 's being compressed so we are all that compressed that 's why we exist What would happen if we just spread and the dimensions stop to put their pressures on us It spread and spread and spread and suddenly We start to see the light and And we disappear which has stopped being compressed by the universe and that 's what we call enlightenment Enlightenment is with all your particles just separate each other Throughout all the dimensions That 's what happened when you get enlightened So this is kind of like taking out all the magic of enlightenment But It 's another point of view of course to to understand what happened how how it happened So the reason why the universe is trying to compress everything is because when it compressed the reality the The universe is able to see what is imagining in the mind and also is able to feel what is seen And is able to live what is feeling Okay , so as much compressed it is That 's much pressure it has We are able to perceive more and more specific points of the universe This is why the universe generates a system of pressure So pressure allows a black hole to create a galaxy a galaxy to create stars Stars to create planets planets to create life Life goes back to the planet The planet goes back to the Stars the stars go back to the Galaxy and the galaxy goes back to the black hole So by pressure we exist because the star explodes Because of the pressure then feels And then by pressure of gravity it starts to move all back Again to the core There are many other factors of why this is happening But we will speak about that in other moments Let 's picture these two words Sharp and acute it 's sharp We call sharp like gravity the the origin of the Latin of of Gravity means sharp okay , so something that is sharp is like going low in vibration like And The opposite acute it goes up These two different vibrations if we picture it like vibration like sound like music So we would understand that gravity is to going down okay and The opposite will be to go Up with an acute sound So the explosion would be the acute in expression And then going back would be gravity which is the low vibration So we usually think that gravity the low vibration is going down We think that it 's going down But it 's not going down is to go to the center by a spiral of a spiral of movement okay , so So it does n't need to go down The only reason why we call gravity the concept of going down is because from our point of view the force that is pushing us to the center is below So that 's why we call it to go down because that 's how we Perceive it but it 's not ways already happening okay So when we call to go down which is gravity is thinking that we are going into a low vibration going down something that is severe okay but but for the universe there 's no below for the universe does n't exist the concept of below this is from our point of view that we call gravity severe something that is bringing us down The reason why for us gravity and the concept of going in a low vibration is something that why pressure to be pressed is something wrong is because for us to be pressed to feel the pressure of gravity going down means to humiliate ourselves to go under someone to put yourself in a lower status okay so from our point of view the pressure is related to oppression is related to the concept of being under someone For this we have a connotation of negativity and relation and relation and also the oppression is to be above this is why we have negative connotation when we speak about pressure and going down so this is something only only for our human point of view from our human point of perception this is something that in the universe does an exist in the universe all this words of being low gravity pressure yeah all of those concepts they do n't have a concept of negativity even negative is something that does n't have any sense for the universe as something that so from the point of view of earth this have a negativity point of view but negative point of view but if we go to the universe it does n't have it anymore so this explains why why we need pressure in our lives because pressure is the key for existence so that 's why we reproduce by pressure we are born by pressure we we leave our lives culturally emotionally in education , in war , in jobs , under pressure our family , put pressure , the religion puts pressure , everything around put pressure on us even blood pressure atmosphere pressure breathing everything is something of pressure sometimes we forget that the most easiest things that makes us be when we are like breathing like heartbeat are due to pressure we are alive because of pressure and we are here existing because of the pressure of the atoms of hydrogen , nitrogen , carbon and oxygen as you are in the surface above in the surface of the world as much above you are the soft the connections of the of the particles in your atoms are so you live in the surface and it 's more more spread and as you go deeper to the core of a world or to a core of the sun so the space of the particles will be closer and being together pressing one into each other just now imagine that for example this is the distance that I have between an electron and the proton in my body because of pressure if I go under the earth going lower and lower and lower the pressure will be closer because of gravity until it gets they are right close and touch when they touch they create the same energy like the fusion so it 's like the core of a sun creating a lot of energy too much pressure this is why also for the astronauts for example that goes in the outer space they get older slower than people on the on the earth because they start to expand not much gravity so this makes us understand that when you have something really expanded there 's no need to transform because everything is floating softly but as closer it gets much more transformation much more speed so transformation this is why transformation can only be lived under a lot of pressure so when you have these two particles so remember remember transformation transformation means to change your forms to be able to go beyond your forms and in order to do that you need for your atoms to be able to change to modify its position so an atom that does n't change its position because it 's relaxed will never transform so in order to transform they need to get closer to be pressed to have pressure and that 's how these two different energies starts to move faster and faster and change so this is why we have heard the sentence we are diamonds in raw and this is because we are made of the same thing of a diamond diamonds are made up with carbon we are a carbon so but our carbon is organized in a very wide and relaxed way compared to the pressure of the carbon of a diamond okay so that 's the only difference is the pressure so maybe if we want if we want to become diamonds what we would have to do is to go maybe like 30 kilometers underground and let 's just with a t-shirt and let 's see when we have to understand from all of this is that when we are talking about pressure and we say I do n't want to feel this pressure anymore what we have to acknowledge is that pressure is the thing that is trying to make this change to transform ourselves without pressure we would n't be able to transform ourselves in a physical world so talking about pressure now we find out that we have two different ways in which we can leave pressure one is by consciousness and the other one by the unconscious by consciousness it means that you take the pressure and you put a goal on it you know that is for your greatest good that you are going to use that pressure to transform and to evolve in the unconscious way you suffer suffering is the choice of the unconscious person of the unconscious person that has no clue of why that person is living the pressure that 's why we can say that suffering is the choice but for sure you have heard that people saying suffering is all the choice but it 's not like okay if it 's a choice I choose now not to suffer and I do n't want to turn anymore I choose that it 's not how it works basically that 's not the way because when you say I do n't want to suffer that wo n't be a way out the way out of suffering would be to acknowledge why I am living what I am living why is the reason why is the goal of the things that I am living and try to put a meaning on the things that you leave okay and that 's why we will take you out from suffer and this would be the logic of pressure the vibration for today is true the statement for today is I am the so emptiness the goal for today conscious integration just as I have become aware of the integration process when instead of eradication what I sensed that was stopping me I used these tools forces patrons with a common objective coherent and with the specific purpose focusing in knowing that I am the final product of all that and the 9 it is nothing more than the 9 myself it 's. . I 'm focusin´ my great因 I 'm softly. I start to massage and carries my body starting from the crown.

To my feet. I 'm softly. I 'm softly. I 'm softly.

I 'm softly. I think that I am doing his great greatest good. I 'm softly. I 'm softly.

I 'm softly. I 'm softly. I 'm softly. I 'm softly.

I 'm softly. I 'm softly. I 'm softly. I 'm softly.

I get closer to the dream. I get closer to the dream. I touch the tongue. I 'm softly.

I recognize that this is the tree of life. This is the great tree of the universe. All of the stars , the planets , the galaxies , the all-percists , the Venus tree. I 'm part of it.

## Energy Work

I become one of its roots. I 'm being absorbed by the modern running. I feel the mind swallowing my body. My legs and feet , my hands and arms , my entire body , the chest that shoulders.

I 'm a head , letting all my nose and eyes out. I 'm so proud of the sun , all the nutrients of this tree. I recognize my own part of this universe. I feel the pressure of my body.

I 'm a pressure from my heart , my roots , pushing me with all the weight towards the ground. I recognize the eye on the tablet of all pressure in the universe. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I find the future of this seed within me.

And now the pressure is not the water in Earth. The universe is the seed on the roots. I feel the pressure on the seed. And it starts the same activity in its land.

I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow.

I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow.

I begin to ring this knot all over my body. I 'm experiencing touching , spreading it from my skin. I recognize that I am watered by a mod , humans for I am human. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow.

I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed to grow. Thank you everybody for being there and as always see you tomorrow for the means.
