## Summary

Day 161 explores **Reason** as the action of thinking—the moment when thought becomes action. While the universe begins with pure Mentality (Day 151), **Reason** is what happens when multiple minds start thinking, creating infinite distortions and interpretations. The teaching emphasizes that reason is divided into three levels based on consciousness: **subconscious reasoning** (survival instincts—hunger, reproduction, fear), **unconscious reasoning** (group thinking—culture, religion, philosophy), and **conscious reasoning** (constant questioning and wondering). The goal is not to eliminate subconscious or unconscious reasoning but to balance all three as **super consciousness**—body, soul, and spirit working together. The day challenges the cultural obsession with "being right" and reveals that the ego uses reason to provide emotional security. True alignment with universal reason means opening to every possibility rather than clinging to one "right" answer. The conscious person recognizes: "All I know is that I know nothing." Reason becomes not a weapon to fight with, but an invitation to expand.

## Key Concepts

### Etymology and Definition
- **Reason:** Latin "ratio" (thought) + "tio" (action) = the action of thinking
- Reason is thinking put into action, the activation of mentality
- As more minds think, more distortions appear—many ways of reasoning emerge
- The universe does this intentionally to receive itself from different viewpoints

### Three Levels of Reasoning

**1. Subconscious Reasoning**
- Ruled by the reptilian brain (inner/ancient brain)
- Driven by survival impulses: hunger, reproduction, fear, cold
- Biological reasoning related to staying alive
- Example: "I am moved by the reason of being hungry"

**2. Unconscious Reasoning**
- Moved by the mind of a group (philosophy, religion, culture, politics)
- Following the same ideas/patterns to belong to a group
- Not bad, just a thing—necessary for social living
- Example: "We all do alignment together, sharing the same ideas"

**3. Conscious Reasoning**
- Questioning everything, realizing there is no final answer
- Recognizing the real answer is: we are all trying to learn
- Individual wondering, never stopping the search for new options
- Knowing the only way to learn is by questioning

### The Super Consciousness Balance
- **Problem with only conscious reasoning:** You become a hermit, unable to communicate or relate to others
- **Necessity of unconscious reasoning:** Allows you to live in society and share with others
- **Necessity of subconscious reasoning:** Without it, we would all die before age five (survival instincts)
- **Goal:** Balance all three as super consciousness—body, soul, and spirit as one
- Like humans are body + soul + mind/spirit, the universe has these three working together

### Current Human Condition
- Right now, humanity lives in **subconscious reasoning** (threat, fear, survival)
- We don't want to die, so we act from fear
- The subconscious controls through survival instinct
- We need to integrate all three levels, not reject any

### Reason and the Ego
- Reason is meant for the **ego** to survive on the emotional level
- The ego tries to help us survive, to teach us, to help us live
- A person with no capacity to believe in anything perceived is considered "crazy"
- So the ego says: "Don't worry, everything I'm receiving and feeling is right—believe me, I am right"
- The ego creates the idea of "being right" to give **emotional security**

### The First Reason of the Universe
- The first reason ever was to **open the mind to every possibility**
- Not to close yourself to only one possibility
- To be aligned with the first reason: open yourself to many possibilities, not preserve only one
- **No one is right, no one has the reason, but we all are the reason**

### Being Right vs. Being Open
- When someone becomes **conscious/aware**, they recognize: "I was never right"
- Famous sentence: "All I know is that I know nothing" (Socratic wisdom)
- The conscious person sets themselves free from all reasons, from believing they are right
- Why? Because **reason is just an idea, a perception—you can't prove it**
- Living in a world controlled by subconscious and unconscious means constant fighting over "who is right?"

### Reason and Emotions
- This is the first concept of the **emotional week**
- Everything we feel comes from the perception of the mind
- Usually we perceive from the viewpoint: "I am right, this is my reason"
- Whatever I'm feeling, I perceive it from "my reason is the right one"

## Teaching Points

1. **Reason is thought in action** - When the universe's Mentality (first law) moves through multiple minds, it becomes Reason—many interpretations emerging
2. **Three consciousness levels reason differently** - Subconscious (survival), Unconscious (group), Conscious (individual questioning)
3. **Balance, not elimination** - The goal is not to be "only conscious" but to integrate all three as super consciousness
4. **Hermit problem** - Being only conscious isolates you; you need unconscious reasoning to communicate and live in society
5. **Survival necessity** - Subconscious reasoning keeps us alive (hunger, fear, reproduction instincts)
6. **Ego's role** - The ego creates "being right" to give emotional security in a chaotic, unprovable world
7. **No one is right** - Reason is impossible to make logical because it's free imagination—no one can prove their reason
8. **First universal reason** - Open to every possibility, not close to one answer
9. **Conscious realization** - "All I know is that I know nothing"—setting yourself free from needing to be right
10. **Emotional origin** - All feelings come from mental perception, usually from "I am right"
11. **Fighting culture** - Humanity (subconscious/unconscious) constantly fights over who has the reason
12. **Expansion practice** - Align with universal reason by expanding your mind to many possibilities, not defending one

## Questions for Reflection

1. **What is the reason of your being?** - What is your fundamental purpose or driving thought?
2. **What are the things in which you think you are right and others aren't?** - Where do you hold tightly to "being right"?
3. **What would happen if you knew you were not right—what would you think and feel?** - How would it feel to let go of being right? (Focus on what you perceive and feel within, not external actions like apologizing)
4. *(Optional reflection)* **Why do you think you don't have reason, that you are not right?** - For those who struggle with the opposite problem

## Alignment Practice

**Setup:**
- Sit comfortably, close your eyes
- Focus on breathing, stretching into a comfortable position
- Become aware of your environment

**Visualization:**
1. **Darkness descending** - Imagine the space getting darker with every breath, until you perceive the darkest night and see the stars
2. **Sacred fire appears** - In front of you, a warm light shines—a fire
3. **Circle gathering** - You are in a circle with other people, all below the stars, surrounding the fire
4. **Watch the flames** - See the fire dancing like a snake, feel the heat on your face, hands, and chest
5. **Recognize the circle** - Look around at the faces of the people in the circle—they all represent your reasons, your beliefs of being right and others being wrong
6. **Linked by reason** - These people are all linked to you by the reason of your being, representing your feelings about right and wrong
7. **No one has the reason** - Observe without judgment: neither they nor you have "the" reason—everyone is guided by their own reasoning
8. **Different viewpoints** - Each person observes the fire from a different point of view
9. **Open your heart** - Feel the heat of the fire; opening to it allows you to open to all possibilities
10. **First reason ceremony** - Recognize this circle around fire as the first place where you found the first reason—this is the **home of your spirit**

**Affirmation:**
- "I expand my reason through my vibration"
- "I realize this is the home of my spirit"
- **"I Am the Spirit's Home"** (repeat three times)

**Closing:**
- Breathe the heat of the fire
- With your hands, take the fire to your heart
- Bring this consciousness back, stretching, each one in your own time
- Return here and now

## Cosmic Heart Message

**Code: Freedom**

Freedom is the ability to turn on and express without any limits other than those we create ourselves. It's a constant call to research for Freedom, which is acquired by becoming the creator of our own reality.

**Unconditional Freedom** implies not only being freed, but **letting others be free**—equally those that I hate and those that I love.

**Be and let be.**

Focus on what **you** are feeling, not what others are feeling.

## Practical Application

**Daily Practice:**
1. **Notice when you think you're right** - Catch yourself in the moment of defending your reason
2. **Ask: "What if I'm not right?"** - Practice opening to other possibilities
3. **Observe your three reasonings** - Throughout the day, notice when you're reasoning from survival (subconscious), from group beliefs (unconscious), or from individual questioning (conscious)
4. **Write down your answers** to the reflection questions
5. **Practice opening to possibilities** - When someone disagrees with you, instead of defending, ask: "What possibility am I missing?"

**Integration:**
- Read the full blog post at justsoy.red (choose your language) for deeper exploration
- Remember: the goal is not to eliminate the ego or its need to be right, but to **recognize** it
- Use the fire circle meditation when you find yourself fighting to be right
- Practice "I Am the Spirit's Home" throughout the day when reason battles arise

**Capricorn Emotional Week:**
This is the beginning of understanding how we **use** emotional links with others. Capricorn asks: "What is this useful for?" Reason is the first emotional concept because emotions arise from mental perception—and we usually perceive from "I am right."
