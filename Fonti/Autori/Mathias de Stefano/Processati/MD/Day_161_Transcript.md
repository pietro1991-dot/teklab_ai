## Introduction

Hello. Good morning , good afternoon. Good evening , everyone.

So , , welcome all of you to the emotional week of Capricorn. If such a thing exists.

So , as everyone starts to connect , I will begin to explain a little bit about what is this week. As we have seen during this week , we have noticed that Capricorn is about structures , about work , about patterns , and this is why regarding the emotional way in which Capricorn is about to see things. We will go into the links , the bounds , the relationships that we have with people , but related to how we use those links with people.

So , as we have seen during the week of the mind , how do we use universal patterns , the universal laws. In this week , we will see how we use the emotional links we have with others.

## Q&A

So , those who we have a lot of Capricorn energy in the charts , as well as the charts , with sometimes can be perceived by others like if we are using the people in order to accomplish our goals in life. As also from our point of view , we can think that we are being used by people too. It 's everything about what do we do with the things. Usually when someone that has a Capricorn son , moon in Capricorn , or a rising in Capricorn , one of the main questions that we ask ourselves when we start a relationship or an emotional link with somebody , the first question would be like , what is this going to be useful for?

So , usually , of course , this is really difficult for the water signs to understand that they think that the Capricorn person would be using them emotionally. But it 's not this from Capricorn point of view. From the Capricorn point of view , to have a relationship with someone is about to do something. It 's about , okay , let 's begin something.

We have something to do. We have a project to do , and I would love to share this with you.

So , the way in which a Capricorn relate to another person is always thinking about what is the job , the work that we have to do together.

So , do n't take it as something bad from the point of view , from another point of view. It 's the way Capricorn people love.

## Energy Work

So , let 's go to the beginning of this emotional week , as always , begin by the Crown Chakra. And we will begin with this kind of idea of the emotional point of view , which is reason to have reason.

## Practice Structure

So , let 's go into this , what reason means and why we are going to work with it in the emotional week. A emoji of reason. Reason comes from the word , the Latin word , radius that means thought. And the word , To , that means action.

So , radius goes , radius means reason. And this To , just into an ass in English , so reason.

So , reason means the action of thinking.

So , we are going to relate the action of reason. With the idea of creating , being able to generate thoughts.

## Energy Work

So , remember that the first week we were working with the mentality this day , the Crown Chakra day. Because everything in the beginning is related to thinking to the main thought , to the world of ideas , the mentality , the mind.

So , if everything begins by there , this means that after that , when we take action through the thinking is the moment when we are going to activate.

The reasoning.

So , to be able to have. Listen , think properly. But then , as we have been seeing every day , there are the laws and marriages correspondence , vibration , rhythm , and so on.

So , all the rest of the things that appear in the unit , just projections , distortions of the main idea.

So , this is how. Reason will also become. Another pattern will become another distortion.

So , it means that as many more minds are thinking , much more distortion in the way we think.

So , many more ways of reason. And this is why. Through time.

The reason becomes only one other way to interpret the world outside. And remember that the reason why the universe does this is because it is willing to have many other options to receive itself from different point of views. It 's all about to learn. But remember that this reason.

The mentality , the mind of the universe , is divided in three different perceptions that we call subconscious and conscience and the conscience. This means that we have three different ways of reason of thinking. One in the subconscious , the other one in the unconscious , the other one in the unconscious. And if I , if I am not being able to think by the conscious way , I would be ruled by the reason of my unconscious.

And if I am not even moved by the reason of the unconscious , I would be ruled by the sin of the subconscious.

So , the reason of the subconscious is ruled by the inner brain that in biology they call the reptilian brain , which is the ancient one that is working with the impulses of survival. For example , you are moved by the reason of being hungry of the reason of willing to reproduce or because you are a friend. You have called whatever.

So there is one type of reasoning that is related with the subconscious , with the biology. And it 's all related with , it 's all related with the survival.

So there is the other way of reasoning , which is the unconscious. The unconscious is the one that shows me that I am moved by the mind of a group. Like , like , a whole group of people , like philosophy , religion , culture , politics , whatever. I grew up there thinking something and because I want to belong to that group , I kind of follow the same ideas or patterns.

Okay , so the same thoughts.

So that 's the reasoning in a group. And this is not a bad thing , this is just a thing. Like , for example , here we are together three to four thousand people to understand that to be part of something.

Okay , and we all do the linemen and etc.

## Q&A

So we are moved by the unconscious too , when we are doing this together. The ideas that we share all together. And then we have the conscious reasoning , which is the question to question everything and to realize that there is no real answer that the real answer is that we are all trying to learn something new.

So the conscious one is the individual that never stop wondering and looking for new options because it knows that the only way you can listen is by question by wondering learning.

So the goal is not to just reason by the conscious way because if we only take the reason of the conscious way , we are not going to be able to be a social being speaking with others sharing with others. Like for example , if you are only conscious way you think so you become like a hermit like you go to cave like a philosopher and you can not have relation or you can not be in touch with anyone because you have not how to do it.

Okay , so you need the. You need the unconscious way of thinking in order to be able to communicate with others and to live in a society. And of course that without a subconscious way of listening. We would be all that because is the subconscious the one that says that can kill you.

Be careful you can learn you can fill down. I 'm hungry.

So. Without that way of thinking. We would have to die all of us before we are five. This is not about.

As you see this is not about. I think that the subconscious is not about being only conscious. Our goal is not to be conscious. Our goal is to have balance in between the three ways consciousness because this Trinity that worked all together subconscious unconscious and the conscious both the three of them.

The way that we are able to do it is to create the super consciousness. The super consciousness is the one that embodies the whole thing like a being like we are body , a soul and a mind , a spirit. As humans , the universe has these three that are together this super consciousness.

So this is what we are trying to achieve not to go away from the subconscious not to take away. The unconscious but to be all together as one. In our humanity. Once we said all this in our humanity we are living right now.

But this stop-conscious way of thinking which means that we are a threat of everything we do n't want to die. And so on.

So that 's the main thing the survival. And because of this. In order to survive humans. But to live in plans and tribes in groups.

So they can have much more opportunity to survive. And because of this we all live through the unconscious way of thinking.

So the way we are recent in our lives is through the groups way of thinking. One that accomplish to be aware. To become conscious about everything. Is the one that realized by when the consciousness from the outside that everything that I before thought it was right.

That I was right. That my reason was the best one. Suddenly the conscious one says , oh no. I was not right.

I was never right.

So here is when the sentence the very non-sensus. I do n't know how to say English but I guess it is. All I know is that I know anything. Or I know nothing.

I do n't know how you say it.

So good.

So why the one that is becoming conscious about the universe. Let. Set itself free from all. Reasons.

That it could have.

The reason why someone that becomes conscious. Aware. Set in a free from all reasons. Believing that is right.

It 's because someone that is aware , Recognize that you can not be right. That you can not have any reason for yourself. Because reason is just an idea. A perception.

So you ca n't pull it.

So there 's only one answer to this , which is. I am the reason. We live in a world controlled by the subconscious and the unconscious. And this is why.

The fact that fighting. Trying to see. Who has the reason? Who is right?

Who is not? And this is. I will think that it 's very mental. That is.

From the mind. Not useful for capital.

So the.

The reason comes from the idea of. Mind of ideas.

So it 's also. Imagination.

So it 's impossible to. To lock. This idea because it 's free. It 's impossible to make it logic.

So this make us know that we can not. We can be right in anything. It 's impossible. And.

And.

The reason. It meant to for ego. To survive. In the emotional level.

So.

The reason is because. The ego. He 's. Is the one that is trying to help us survive.

Is the one that tries to. Teach us. Help us to leave. A person that have.

No chance to believe in anything that. You can see or perceive and feel. It 's crazy. It 's like.

Ca n't understand anything.

So that 's why the ego says do n't worry. Everything that I am receiving , everything that I am feeling is right.

So believe me , I am right. This is why the ego creates the idea of being right in reason to give security , emotional security to a person.

So in order to use the right reason , we have to go to the origin of the mind of the universe. What was the first reason ever? The first reason ever was to open the mind to every possibility , to every possibility , not to close yourself to only one possibility. This is why the way in which we can be aligned with the first reason of the universe is if we open ourselves to many possibilities and not to preserve of to only one.

No one is right , no one has the reason , but we all are the reason. This is why this is the first spot and concept of emotional , because everything that I feel comes from the perception of the mind.

So whatever I am feeling , usually I perceive it from the point of view of I am right. This is my reason.

So I will read the three questions that we have to write down today in order to answer ourselves. I would recommend you to read the blog for today.

So you can have it and be your idea.

Remember that the blog is called justsoy. Ret. This is I am Spanish and read it like the color that means network. You have to choose your language.

So the questions are , what is the reason of your being? What are the things in which you think you are right and others are n't? What happened if you know that you are not right , what would you think? What would you feel?

All related to what I feel. Not what I do after. If I apologize , if I know everything related to what you perceive and feel within. And of course that for some people , the question would be , why do you think that you do n't have?

## Daily Practice Elements

That you are not right. That 's so information for today. The vibration for today is ba. The statement for today is I am the spirit 's home.

The code for today is Freedom. From the cosmic heart , one of the keys is the ability to turn on express without any limits other than those that we create ourselves. It 's a constant call to research for Freedom , which is acquired by becoming the creator of our own reality. And conditional , Freedom implies not only being Freed , but letting others to be Freedom.

Equal those that I hate and those that I love. Be and let be. That is for you to focus on what are you feeling , not what I am feeling. Close , all right.

Take the breath and focus in your breathing. As you start to position your body in a comfortable position. I become aware of the environment I find myself in. I begin to imagine that all this space that I am in starts to get darker in shadows.

More and more , which with every deep breath , until I can perceive everything around me. Like the darkest night , and I can even perceive the stars in this sky. And in front of me , I can perceive. Oh , a light.

A warm light that starts to shine on me. Until I realise that it is a fire. A size C the fire. I recognise that I find myself in a circle with other people.

We are all below the stars surrounding a fire. And the aside perceived this new environment , I just watch the light of the fire of the flames. Dancing like a snake. Breath.

I can feel the heat of this fire in my face , in my hands , and my chest. I start to watch around and to see the faces and the chest of the other people in the circle around fire. They are all here , recent to my reason. They all I linked to me , by the reason of my being.

They all represent my feelings regarding when I was right and in the eye of the wrong. All of them representing my beliefs of my own reasons. Without judging what you see , allow yourself to see the faces of these people. Even if they are only three or twenty.

You are all connected in this ceremony , this ancient ceremony around fire. In the center , the four represents the reason. And I recognize now , anyone of them neither me has their reason. They are all guided by them , their own shining because of it.

I observe that each one of them of us are observing their tune from a different point of view. And I feel that if I open myself my own heart to perceive the heat of this fire , I am also going to be able to open myself to all the problems. I recognize that this circle around fire was the first place where I found the first reason this is the home of my spirit. And I expand my reason through my vibration.

## Guided Meditation

And I realize that this is the home of my spirit. I am the spirit home. I am the spirit home. I breathe the heat of the fire.

And with my hands I take it to my heart. And I realize that this is the home of my spirit. And I take it to bed and each one at a time come back here and now. Thank you everybody for being there.

And as always see you tomorrow at the same time.
