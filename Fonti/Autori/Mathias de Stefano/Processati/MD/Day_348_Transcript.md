## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening. Welcome to all of you to our day related to ICE in the emotional week of cancer.

So the topic for today is Users. And I bet for sure that you would never had imagined that close to the end of a long path of consciousness we would end speaking about Users.

So in the emotional week , let 's talk about carrots and potatoes.

So let 's be aware of two important things we 're going to discuss about the important things.

So I 'm going to dedicate this week to my friend that she is doing the corrections of these videos to upload it in the campus.

So she hates botanist and plants.

So this whole week has been dedicated to her.

So let 's make just the idea so we can all have a picture of it.

So we have here two options to different options of different ways of a plant.

So first of all , let 's remember that when we talk about a plant , we have exactly the iceberg. We spoke the first week. We have a limit which is here the ground and then an upper part related to the conscious and then over part related to the unconscious.

## Energy Work

So the conscious part would be the trunk , the branches , the fruit , the flower , the leaves , all the parts that you can see from a plant that are visible outside. And then all the hidden parts in the ground will be unconscious part of the plant. With the roots and of course the tubes.

So as we have said , the roots take all the minerals that a plant needs in order to send them up to the leaves. The leaves does the process of the process of photosynthesis through the sun , the light. And through the light , again the energy , the power to blossom to create the flowers to produce a fruit where within you have the seeds in order to produce a new plant. This regarding the conscious part of the plant.

But when we speak about the unconscious , we also have the same thing. We have the fruits of the ground which are the tubes. Tubes are like a fruit in the underground that they emerge from the roots. And they are useful as a reserve of water , minerals , salt and all the products the plant is producing.

They are storage here. They are storage inside the tubes.

So in the plants , they storage all these minerals and water and salt to produce the seeds. The tubes are here. Just in case something happened like a drought for example. Or there is a lack of any mineral.

So the roots can take those nutrients from the tubes. And also the tubes starts to expand and create new roots that can go along the territory. And from them they can born again new plants aside. Like if they are new seeds.

What we have here is that all these tubes act like seeds and roots at the same time. For sure you have seen these potatoes , for example , when you have them and suddenly they start to create a new plant.

So they use that.

So usually we do n't eat roots of a plant. We eat the tubes.

So when you think about eating something that are growing under the ground.

So actually are these structures that the plant are that the plant create in order to storage all the nutrients that have been produced in the plant.

Okay.

Remember this that the fruits are produced to create seeds. And we are in the upper part of the plant which is related to the fruits of the future.

So create something that we are aware of that we know what is going to be new for like trying to make something in the future. And of course here on the ground the unconscious is a storage. The storage of the past is not for the future. It 's something that is from the past.

So the tubes are connecting and storage information from the past from straight to from the roots , which is not for the future. Just to clarify some things. Then you can search of course , but remember there are not all the things that are growing and that we eat that grow under the ground are just. For example , there are some.

Pines. Pines they grow. Under the ground , but they are seeds. They are not tubes.

Other fruits that for example grow close to the ground touching the ground like the anonath pineapple. The pineapple. They have roots , but the pineapple is a fruit even if it 's touching the ground.

Okay. Ginger is a is a tube for example , but. Many other things that we consume from the underground are not tubes.

Okay.

## Q&A

So just you have to figure out. And once that this I will give you some task to make. Can. Simcealy , but it 's not and it 's it 's regarding this here.

## Energy Work

And can help in our life. That that 's would be to. To wonder from where come the things that you eat. If they come from a tree , if they come from the roots , if they are.

If they are seeds , if those seeds are born down the ground or they are up. Try to check it. Try to figure out because sometimes when we eat. If they are not clue , if they are related to the ground to the underworld , if they are related to the light.

Looking for the sun. And acknowledging that can organize also our inner energy. Can helps us to know. From where the things come and.

In what we are become because we are eating that.

So it 's it 's important to know that. I recommend to do that because sometimes I 've heard about kids that had no. I have from where a chicken came from. They thought that they were coming from the supermarket or they could n't relate the eggs with a chicken.

And. Or where a fruit is coming from and from which territory.

So it 's really important nice to know. Where the things come from.

So we can acknowledge. We can not acknowledge what are we eating what are we become.

Okay. And a lot of people might not know from where. Things come. I would recommend you to look in the internet.

And for them and you will see images from the plants and to know where to come from. Two ways of seeing. The two of us. The two ways is is.

In one hand. When.

Remember that yesterday we spoke that the roots are like our ancestors. From the past all the people that have lived before and. And created us and so. To be like kind of a two more.

Okay. That comes from the roots.

So many things are storage there. Then maybe are not. Are not living the plant. Keep going like maybe they can accumulate the seas.

Okay. It could be a risk for the plant for the final tree that someone is grabbing. Very old information and does n't let it go. For example.

And in the other hand. A over also is a reserve or is a. It 's a storage of.

So we can create a new way that. The tools and information that can be used. Long time in the future. For example when you take a potato , you can.

Leave it there in a box for. You can grow again , you can continue with the information of the entire family.

So in our family tree , we usually have some of these tubes that sometimes they are so big that they storage so many information from their own , that they conditioned the entire plant , the entire history of the tree. What happened with this tube that had so much weight in our history , that usually the plant kind of feeding that tube and it starts to grow and grow and grow , taking all the sucking all the energy from the plant , for example. When a tube starts to grow and receives so much energy from the plant , they start to grow and expand , pushing the soil around and started to be in pressure.

So a lot of pressure around , okay.

So it starts to expand and push the soil up , creating like this hill here. The word tube comes from the inner p. M. Languages that means to expand , to expand your expand , expand is tube , that comes also , that creates also the word tumblr , that is this hill here , which is the origin of the word tum , okay , tum.

So for the ancient ones , they thought like the idea was like when they would bury someone , a person in a coffin , they would be like these tubes and they would leave this graveyard like this , like a hill over the the coffin , so everyone could know that below there is a dead body , okay.

So that 's why they call it tum , because it is an expanded land , an expanded hill , okay , which is related to tube , and also gives the name to a tumour , all things that get expanded. Tuba tumblr tumour , tumour , tumour , tumblr tumblr tumour , tube , they all come from expanding , from inflate something , so like for tuberans is like something that is ahead expanding.

So as you see , all these words are related to death , are related to a dead body in a coffin down tum.

So the bad side of the interpretation regarding a tube is that a tube would be in our tree , a dead one , a dead body , that is so heavy in our history that is still within us , that is still living in our life , acting in our current days.

So as an example for this of having a dead one , a dead body , that is very present in our life , for example myself , well most of the of the people in the Americas , we have this condition of losing the land because they all have to migrate.

So they were exiled from the countries and to live in South America or North America , Central America.

So all these people lost their houses , lost everything , and most of them has this trauma of not having a home and they are looking for the independence to start again to do something new.

So most of our families have this trauma from the past. For example my own family , my grand grandfather , now my grand grandfather , the grandfather of my grand , he came in a ship boat from Italy to Argentina and , , upgrading and he lost everything in Italy and he had to restart to do something new in Argentina to build a new house , but his present , his presence was so strong that he managed to push away their own kids from home so they had to to make their own houses.

So they were always like migrating from one house to another and that condition the whole family tree because he was such a heavy person in our history that he conditioned everything in our family and he was so present and so strong in our history that even myself when I was 10 years old and even more I used to put the frame with his picture a picture that he had since 1910 a picture of him in my bathroom with his face like , I do n't know , I was feeling like I was honoring him but actually nobody locked him in my family.

So he was still alive in our family a lot and so what a person like that is doing is that his present is so strong that it grows so much that generate pressure in the environment.

So it 's not environment the history that pressure that person but the person is making pressure in all the others around.

So sometimes there 's a lot of energy in our attitudes you know where things through our life but because there 's a dead person from our family that is taking a lot of energy from our tree someone that is dead but even though it 's still much alive. Besides the graveyard of tubes is important to remember that the tube is storageing a lot of things that are really good for the plant.

So it is heavy for us but it is also useful because it is all the things that we need.

The reason why we are not using we are so basically we are not using all the energy and all the nutrients from the tube and the whole tree is trying to tourism the tube instead.

So actually many of us will leave our lives for someone that is dead. It 's like if someone that is in a coffin has so much weight in our lives that we all in our family tree are living the life that that person would love to keep living and does n't let us grow because we are all feeding its own dream.

So our goal is to try to change that. The goal that we have is to change that circle and how do we do it? We have to take the energy from there. We have to approach that history and to start change that point of view.

So our energy is not used by the tube , the dead person , for its own goals but we use that history for our own process of creating future.

So it is the same energy. It is not that we have to change this energy is that we have to direct that energy towards another issue. Many of us are living a life through people that is already dead.

So in order to go towards the future we have to continue them to honor them and to wrap that energy towards our own purpose , our own future.

So today I explain in the blog. I wo n't explain all of this now. I just wrote about that in the blog so you can read it later but just wanted to explain that in history we have many different ways in which we can understand this main 10 tubes that are in the tree of life and that help us understand the energy that we have and also the full energy and tools that can help us to manifest this potential.

So I will give two examples of this. One related to the Novi tree of life which is Egorasil and the other one related to the Hindu , a tree of life which is the Sephiroth.

So for example in Egorasil in this tree of life we have nine kingdoms plus one this devoid and we have many of them that are encoding the information of entire history.

So for example the most known that you for sure have heard sometime are Nibilheim that is the most dark one. The other one is our existence which is Midway and of course the kingdom of the gods which is Award.

So I say these three names because for sure you have heard this in some movie like Marvel movie about Thor. Those are three of those two girls of existence in this tree.

So of course that for sure you have seen this image that is the Sephiroth kind of like this.

So each one of them represents like planets , realms and different levels of consciousness in the existence but we will call it here like two girls of three of life because because they are like the accumulation of entire potential of the everything. For us in our entire path we have also been working with these nine kingdoms , nine heavens or however you want to call them which are the nine the ten days that we were being using in each one of their weeks.

So we have the nine devils.

So in so one and they which is the Tours Day which is the breathing.

So every day we have been using one of these two girls that are the summary of the entire information of the cosmos.

Remember that Aside 's plane at the beginning of this video they can be taken as fruits or as two girls of this tree. Besides you can call them fruits or two girls I would like to call them two girls because they are the creation of the entire data , the entire information and then you can activate the knowledge the fruits , sorry the potential that has these tubes with the fruits which are the letters of the knowledge.

So for example in the Ectracial Culture and Nordic culture you have the rooms and in the Sephiroth you have the 22 letters of Hebrew and in side to the Applantern Language we have the 36 consonants.

So in these old cultures what they what they did is to determine that in each one of these tubes of the tree are like these kingdoms of homes that where different people could leave like divinity , dead people or whoever , natural beings , whatever they are different realms organized as packages of information and through the language , through the letters you can figure out what that 's a what information they can bring to you and you can use throughout the communication and history through the history that you know just all. The summary of all this would be that the tubes of our tree of life are the determining and accumulating energy and information that can determine our destiny. But if we through the unconscious but if we become conscious about it we can use that energy in order to build our own destiny and for that we need to use the power of those letters. Basically why we have to do is to in order if we want to make this an interesting version into an aware in the information we have to use the power of the letters we have to use the power of the fruits of these trees.

So but these fruits is not the letters itself is the meaning the concepts that they embody.

So that 's why I wrote in the post today you can check it later. I wrote there about the meaning the concepts that embody each one of the letters from the runes and also the Hebrew letters. And remember also that if you want to know about the meaning of the Atlantis letters and and how to use the concept of them , you can go to one of the blocks that I already remember the name which one I posted that I explained each one of the Atlantis letters. And I want to clarify again this just in case it 's not about the letters.

Okay it 's about the concept that are in the letters.

So for example letter L means love.

So do n't take the letter L or using the letter L you will await love. It 's not exactly like that. It 's about the concept. What we are talking about right now.

Okay so it 's about looking for which attributes you have to activate in order to awaken the book.

Okay all this is written in the block. Eventually someday I will try to do a warship or something regarding the letters , the the power of the words and how to use them and so on. But I will do it next year for sure. The vibration today is Ul.
