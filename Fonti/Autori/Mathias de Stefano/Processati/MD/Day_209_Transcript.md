## Introduction

Hello , hi everyone. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you , whatever you are.

## Q&A

Some people have questions that makes me questions and some other say they , he does n't answer any question or something like this.

So I will try to explain why I am not answering questions.

So the people that usually helps me to help the others to know everything.

So you have what to answer to them.

Okay?

So this is another thing.

So there are a lot of questions.

Some people that does the questions. I do n't answer the questions like there , like , oh , someone did this question. I answered that question. I take the question and I answer it inside the video , inside explanation.

So I usually do that when I am speaking.

So if you have any questions , try to pay attention. Maybe I am answering it as I explain the topic.

Sometimes if I do n't answer them , maybe it is because I did in other videos. And of course , there are sometimes very interesting questions that I would love to talk about , but they are not related to the topic.

So I am trying to follow a line. It follows a concept , a pattern of all the explanations.

So this is why I do n't take other questions that are not related to the main idea of what the project is talking about.

Remember that I am not doing these videos to explain things questions or those things. I am doing these videos explaining specific pattern of our purpose. Also , just for you to know , when all this ends , the I am project ends in 2022 , of course , I will keep doing this not every day that maybe once a week. And in that moment , I will be interacting and answering your questions because we will not have a specific timeline to follow.

We wo n't be necessary to follow a structure.

So next year for sure , we will be able to do that.

So I am sorry if some people think that what I am doing is very agocentric or selfish , I am just speaking my own point of view and whatever. Doing this , not interacting with you or so on , but as I said , I am trying to follow a pattern for this year that I need to do.

So I am sorry , this year will be like that. And in 2022 and on , we can do whatever , no structure.

So let 's begin with the topic for today which is the feet , ankles related to our topic. Which is the planet Jupiter. For me , Jupiter , after the Earth , is the most beautiful planet of the solar system.

So for sure , you have seen images of Jupiter like this , which is very beautiful , but many of these pictures are like done with different photographs and so on. And I put today in the blood , a picture of the planet that was taken , I guess , that by the Casino , I do n't know , I do n't really know of me.

Something , was taken and it 's so beautiful that really , as I wrote today , it seems like a bang painting. It 's amazing. It 's art , it 's plenty of art.

So this planet is the biggest of the solar system , but that is made up with gas. Next , the size of the Earth , the Earth , the Jupiter. Very small.

So for sure , the most incredible image that you have seen from Jupiter has like one eye , like a big eye. And that eye is , that eye is a hurricane , really. It 's not the night , it 's the hurricane.

Now it 's disappearing , but it 's so big that three Earth can be inside that hurricane is torn.

So it 's so huge that in 183 or 4 planets , Earth can fit inside that story.

So the planet is so grassy that even the nucleus is only liquid.

So it 's basically the whole nucleus is liquid and it does n't have a surface like Earth. It is only liquid that starts to go to become gas in the atmosphere , and different kinds of atmosphere. This planet is all made up with gas , completely gas. The liquid in the nucleus and gas on the different atmosphere.

So the different atmosphere are moving really fast in the planet , which is what you can see here with layers of Jupiter. You can see the different lakes. And why they are created like this? Is because of Cornelis effect.

Cornelis effect is the spinning of the planet , the spinning of its own axis , how it moves all the atmosphere around. Then you can check it more in internet , but basically the Cornelis effect is the one that makes the storms move in one side in the north and in the other side in the south. When you see a map in the internet when they show how the atmosphere is the clouds move in the planet , you will see that in the north they are going that way and in the south they 're going this way.

So this is because of the spin of the planet and how the atmosphere are moving around. This is also why the the seas , the currents of the seas are also moving one way and moving the other way in the south.

So that 's because of the spin in the planet and this planet spins so fast that the Cornelis effect is really fast and also it 's also not only fast , but also it 's that 's why the whole planet does n't have like us mountains and and plans to oceans to treat different these Cornelis effect.

So it 's all gases.

So that 's why you can see the layers of different gases organized according to according to its weight , okay it 's density.

So that 's why you can see like layers of a cake in Jupiter because of this fast movement.

So you can see how some of them goes that way , some of them comes this way.

So it 's really beautiful how you can see this effect. And it 's so fast that the spin in it is so fast that that it creates many storms.

So the winds in this planet is 300 kilometers per hour and 500 kilometers per hour.

So it 's really heavy. It 's all gas so nobody can live there but it 's heavy. That of course this planet is impossible to live not only because of their winds but also because that entire atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium.

Okay so it 's impossible.

So also you have ammonia and the atmosphere so forth hydrogen I guess so it 's impossible to live basically to have life.

So it 's so fast Cornelis effect is so fast because of the movement of the planet that it is the fastest planet on solar system it turns on its axis in less than 10 hours nine hours and five fifty minutes 10 hours.

So Earth is 24 hours Jupiter only 10.

So that 's fast.

Okay so this planet is so big that it 's like kind of the second sun for us. We could say that the sun of course is the most important because everyone is related to the sun but in such a way somehow we are also bounded by the gravity of this planet somehow.

So even if we are all related to the sun this planet is also affecting us in affecting us in a way. It 's like telling us that there is an important path towards Jupiter.

So this planet even if it is so big this planet is not was not considered as big in the past because from our point of view the people in the past saw this planet in the same size as a star okay but it was a little bit smaller than Mars so it was behind.

So for the people in the past they perceived the planet as someone something that was like walking through the stars and it was someone important something important but it was taking care of the skies. It was behind Mars and Venus which we are already spoke about.

So they saw that it was a very important light in the universe too. It 's because of its light it 's presence that they thought it was important to name this planet with the one taking care of the light bringing the light and guiding us in the light.

So because of this let 's go to try to understand why we decided to name this planet as Jupiter. I remind you this again as always for the ancient ones the gods were not people but they were concepts that hold on it many other objects of the earth. Gods were what we can name today archetype.

So for example something that we use a lot in our daily life is to behold the whole the different people as if it is only one like for example saying the mothers. There are many mothers many women that are mother in the planet but we say usually the mother okay the mother in the planet earth they does this that so so it 's like a singular concept speaking about many other concepts okay many other objects.

So for example we say the mother the father to relate that so eventually we start to speak about the spirit of all the mothers as the mother and that 's how it comes as much we use it it comes to become the divine mother the divine father and so on and that 's how we create the divinity.

Sorry the cat is playing with the computer it 's just that I have the computer on one of the things where the cat plays that looks like this so. What I was saying Spanish is that the origin of the name the origin of the name divine comes from the idea from the ancient people the they thought that all these concepts were bringing light were bringing awareness were bringing clarity okay so because of this they started to call the day of the wisdom the day of the beauty the day of the war so because of this clarity they name the divinity as the day of or the light of okay so in the European languages you name this light you name it yellow yellow so yellow is the one that originates the word D. W. That gives divine.

So we will have two currents of the word D. W. One Greek the one Roman.

So in Greece they will call jail as News in Rome they will call jail as Ois.

So who was News the god of the ray the god of light who was Ois the god of sky the god of the heavens of the light. For the Greek people News is the father of all gods because the light originates everything god is light maybe you have heard this before. Ois for the Romans is the god that guides the Roman Empire to the light to be the turrets is the father of all the others okay News is the word that originates D. W.

News which is god in Spanish in all the Roman languages so every time that we name that we say god in Spanish or any Roman languages we are saying News the Greek concept of the father of light the god of light.

So for both of them from the Greek and the Romans News You where the father of light so in the European language father you will say Peter. In English we say father the comes from Peter so when we want to say the father of the light how do we say it. Jéu Peter. That 's the sound familiar.

Jéu Peter. Jéu Peter originates from the word the father of light.

So in the past let 's go to the very origin of our humanity again when we wear animals and we started to be nomads okay so we started to walk around to the horizons so we have two different concepts here the male the alpha male and the female alpha and I do n't know how to say in English so we had the alpha male that was the one going ahead opening the path because they were nomads so they were trying to to move to the horizon and to open the path and behind there was the female alpha that was the one taking care of the family and now I will again try to say this do n't think about males being over the feminine here we are speaking about the ancient way of seeing the things for the antiquity that female alpha was the most important thing it was the secret feminine without the feminine there was no humans they were only three they needed to have much more so if the male if the female was in front open in the path anyone or anything can kill her and without feminine no humans so this is why we have to understand that it 's not about why the women has to go behind they were they were behind because nobody because they needed to be protected because otherwise no humans okay so it 's important to understand this that is do n't think about that with the point of view from our civilization okay today we have to go back that this is not how to say but we are called civilization or the basis of the patriarchal civilization this is protecting the most sacred thing which was the feminine okay so now we see this why the father became the light because what was the concept that could unify all the fathers the male the alpha male that were guiding the people through the horizon the way in which they could be all together in one concept was the sun because the sun is the noma aspect of someone that goes from out from the horizon goes up and goes all around the skies and then goes down in west so it was guiding all the nomads people so that 's why for the nomads the father of light was in the sky was the sun so that 's the origin of our our lord our father which is in the sky who is in the sky so that 's the concept of that father being in the sky and the mother on the earth because they had to stay in the case so this is the concept of history of how we put the father in the sky it was a noma concept okay that 's why we started to call God as a father in the sky and that 's why Jupiter the father of the light is the one that guides us as nomads into the horizon to seek for something something that is said put their in front ahead and in Latin we say this pro opposite something that is put in front but opposite is the origin of the word purpose this is why we relate the father of light with the one guiding us to find the purpose of our systems and this is why we named in the past to that light in the sky guiding us in the horizon as Jupiter to guide us towards the purpose so let 's remember this again the idea of the divine mother and a divine father is just a projection of our human point of view towards the universe and is this why we humans do this alpha omega alpha omega this alpha here is man man this is to be born birth hmm man birth this is to grow in the concept of antiquity man gives me birth and helps me grow this is the feminine path and then we will do we will go through the masculine this is rare produce and where it goes to that to the father what is this the mother to die this is the circuit from the mother to the father and once I die I go back to be born this is a cycle of life there is a part that is ruled by the feminine and the part ruled by the masculine being female or being male does the mother what this means that we come from the mother and we go to the father have you heard that sometime hmm I come from the mother I go to the father I come from the birth I go to die so if I come from the mother from the womb from the uterus and I see in front of me in the proposed in the purpose I will find the path of the die of death the end the father so this cycle is something that is living in our cells from the very beginning before we were animals we have been produced by this cycle so our mother created us making us grow and then we have to follow the father where the father said where to go this cycle makes us go through a process of transcendence that makes us come back in the next in the next term so because this cycle and how we repeated once and again once and again this cycle get us attached to the idea that we always have to accomplish something in front that we need to go to do something to follow what others are saying that we have to accomplish a purpose in our life is a constant cycle that got stuck in ourselves is a programming is in this way in which we humans create a idea of purpose and from living it with our bodies it came into our psychology which comes from the Greek word C. H. That means soul when we do something many times repeated once and again it becomes a mechanism a programming once again as you see here we are the only animals that have created psychologically the idea of purpose so there is nothing in nature nothing in the cosmos that creates the idea of the purpose only we do we have made the purpose into a reality because of the repetition of looking something that is in front this purpose it does not actually if you do not have a it does not matter if you do not have a father in this life it does not matter if you do not know where are you going in this life is a programming in yourself your body is genetics is there okay so what is the purpose then so basically the purpose is a biological system that helps us to move forward when we are unaware of our inner power of creation we need the purpose in order to move forward and maybe this sentence is very heavy for me and for myself for everyone and this is because our entire existence has been built in order to find a purpose another question would be is it wrong to think about the purpose if it does n't exist no the answer would be is because of the purpose that we exist having noticed that is the opposite that is not that we exist because there is or we have a purpose but we exist because of a purpose that is why I am the purpose this is why the only way in which we can keep existing and keep expanding ourselves is by creating more purpose if we do n't put the intention of the purpose they get the purpose we do n't have any meaning in our life until I do n't realize myself that I am the origin of my own purpose I will believe in the purpose of others and last thing to understand is that we are all one we are not separate beings so it does n't matter from which they mentioned I am receiving a purpose if the six dimensions seven dimensions it does n't matter if there are beings telling me what to do all of it is my own because there 's no time no space for the I am so it is my own self projecting purpose of my own self so there are no beings in other dimensions telling me what to do it 's my own self in different levels of consciousness reminding me what I was willing to do see I know there are many times many things sorry but each one and it 's some time so is there a purpose no but I am the key to create the purpose so you can you breath relax relax that we are nothing like the one brother of my grandfather used to say we are nothing and precisely that is the key to become everything the biggest freedom that one can have is to acknowledge that it 's myself who creates existence and that path is really hard because that 's the path of the solitude and this is why tomorrow we will face the one that is the solitude which is the song the sol. .

## Daily Practice Elements

. Let 's go to the information for today the vibration for today is due the statement for today is I am the balance of the workers the code for today is spring after ether comes the blooming of life with water element that represents the temporary process of spring this concept does in refer only the moment of digital looming but that in all the planets the spring period is understood as the moment of its precipitous where an emerging process whether it 's has its mineral digital or animal occurs let 's go to the limit sit comfortable close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing I become aware of the body I find myself in here and now becoming aware of the room I am in the house the building the village the city the country the continent and even the planet inside take a deep breath I become fully aware that I am present inside this body touching it , caracinant , stretching it and becoming fully plenty in this body I take an breath and I expand becoming the room I take an breath , expanding me and becoming the house the building I take a deep breath and I expand myself becoming the village the city I take an breath and expand becoming the country I take an breath and expand become the continent I take a deep breath and I expand becoming the entire planet I am dear And I seem front of me , the light of the sun , surrounding me , feeling the heat of it , I still the moon , surrounding me , contemplating around me , and there are three dinners and Mars. Behind the asteroid belt , I see Jupiter and Saturn , and beyond Trans Neptune and Jupiter. I am the entire solar system.

I extend my arms towards Jupiter and I grab this planet , the huge planet between my hands , bring in it in between my feet. I take a deep breath , aside we see how all its gases are absorbed by my angles. I recognize here that Jupiter is ties for the sense of purpose of my soul. As here , my angles for the sense of purpose of my life.

## Q&A

I take a deep breath and dive in making myself a question , whom I am the purpose of from. I am leaving the lives that others were willing to leave. I am the purpose of my biology of the history of my family. I am the purpose of my soul , the history of myself , or I am the purpose of my spirit out of time and space.

I recognize I am the result , the purpose of all the systems. I am the result , the purpose of my life. I am the purpose of my life. I am the result , the purpose of my life.

I make myself a question , what is my purpose? I am the purpose of all the paths that I am. I am the purpose of all the workers throughout the time and space to get in breath. I am the result , the purpose of all the systems.

I am the purpose of all the systems. I am the purpose of the workers. I am the purpose of all the systems. I am the purpose of all the systems.

I am the purpose of all the systems.
