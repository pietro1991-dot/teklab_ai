## Overview

We're on **Day 7 of the Emotional Week of Libra**, working with the **Root chakra** and exploring **Attraction and Manifestation**.

Before we begin, Matías shares that he has a headache and is not feeling very clear today. He even briefly channels his higher self during the teaching, which creates a shift in the energy and depth of the message. This vulnerability and transparency remind us that even in discomfort, profound teaching can emerge.

**Attraction and Manifestation** have become buzzwords in modern spirituality:
- "Law of Attraction"
- "Manifest your dreams"
- "Attract abundance"
- Vision boards, affirmations, manifestation techniques

We're told that if we just think the right thoughts, feel the right feelings, visualize clearly enough—we can attract and manifest whatever we want.

But today we'll discover a revolutionary truth:

**The "Law of Attraction" has been misused and misunderstood. It's actually the Law of RESONANCE—you can only attract what you already resonate with.**

**Wishing doesn't work. You must BECOME the vibration of what you seek.**

And we'll learn that **attraction and manifestation are not about accumulation** (getting and keeping) **but about FLOW** (receiving and giving, attracting and creating, in constant circulation).

This teaching will fundamentally change how you understand creating your reality.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology: Push and Pull

Let's start with what these words actually mean:

**ATTRACTION** comes from Latin **"TRAHERE"** (to pull, to drag)
- Like "truck" or "tractor" (vehicles that pull heavy loads)
- **Attraction = to push toward yourself, to pull something from outside toward inside**

**MANIFESTATION** comes from:
- **"MANUS"** = hands
- **"FESTARE"** = party, festival, celebration
- **Manifestation = to make a party with your hands, to celebrate the creation you've made**

**So:**

**Attraction = bringing the outside toward the inside (receiving)**

**Manifestation = bringing the inside toward the outside (giving, creating)**

### The Root Chakra: Needs and Creation

We're working with the **Root chakra** today—the foundation of our existence, connected to:
- Survival needs
- Basic security
- Physical vitality
- Grounding in reality

**At the Root chakra level:**

**Attraction is based on NEEDS**—what you need to survive, to feel secure, to exist physically.

**Manifestation is creating NEW THINGS**—expressing your vitality outward, creating something that didn't exist before.

**Both find their middle point in VITAL ENERGY**—the life force that flows through receiving and giving, attracting and creating.

### The Misuse of "Law of Attraction"

**The Law of Attraction has been heavily misused in modern spirituality.**

Here's how it's typically taught:

"Think about what you want. Visualize it. Feel it. Believe you already have it. The universe will bring it to you."

**This teaching is based on CAPITALISM and ACCUMULATION:**
- Get what you want
- Keep what you get
- Accumulate more and more
- The goal is to HAVE

**But this completely misses the point of how energy actually works.**

### The Law of Resonance: The Real Truth

**The Law of Attraction is actually the LAW OF RESONANCE.**

**You can only attract what RESONATES with you.**

**Resonance means: vibrating at the same frequency.**

Think of a tuning fork:

If you have two tuning forks tuned to the same frequency, when you strike one, the other will begin to vibrate even though you didn't touch it.

**Why? Because they RESONATE. They're at the same frequency.**

**This is how attraction actually works:**

**You don't attract what you WANT. You attract what you ARE.**

**You don't attract what you WISH for. You attract what you RESONATE with.**

### Wishing Doesn't Work—You Must Resonate

**If you're vibrating at scarcity, you attract scarcity.**

**If you're vibrating at abundance, you attract abundance.**

**If you're vibrating at fear, you attract fearful experiences.**

**If you're vibrating at love, you attract loving experiences.**

**This is why "positive thinking" alone doesn't work:**

You can think positive thoughts all day, but if you're VIBRATING at fear, lack, unworthiness underneath those thoughts—**that's what you'll attract.**

**Your vibration is not your thoughts. Your vibration is your BEING.**

**To attract something different, you must BECOME a different vibration.**

**You must resonate with what you seek.**

### Energy Must Flow, Not Accumulate

Here's the crucial understanding that's missing from most manifestation teaching:

**Energy that is attracted should be USED (manifested), not ACCUMULATED.**

**Attraction and manifestation are a FLOW:**

1. You attract energy/resources based on your resonance
2. You USE that energy to manifest something (create, give, express)
3. Your manifestation creates fruits/seeds for others
4. This recycling of energy creates more flow

**The problem with accumulation:**

When you attract energy and then HOARD it, KEEP it, ACCUMULATE it without using it—**the flow stops.**

Stagnant energy becomes toxic. Unused resources decay. Accumulated wealth without circulation creates imbalance.

**Like water:** Flowing water is alive, fresh, healthy. Stagnant water becomes putrid.

**Energy is meant to FLOW through you, not be stored by you.**

### Manifestation Creates Fruits for Others

**When you manifest—when you create something from the energy you've attracted—you create fruits.**

These fruits are **seeds for others.**

Think of a tree:

The tree attracts resources (water, nutrients, sunlight) from its environment.

The tree manifests (creates leaves, bark, structure, flowers).

The tree creates fruits with seeds inside.

**These fruits feed others AND spread new trees.**

**The tree doesn't keep everything it attracts. It uses what it attracts to create, and what it creates serves the whole ecosystem.**

**This is the natural law of attraction and manifestation: FLOW.**

Attract → Use → Create → Share → Attract more

**Not:** Attract → Keep → Accumulate → Want more → Force attraction

### Both Laws Are Rooted in Biology

**Attraction and manifestation are not just spiritual concepts—they're biological realities:**

**Attraction** is rooted in **NEEDS from your parents:**
- As babies, we needed everything from parents
- Food, warmth, safety, love, resources
- We learned to attract what we need for survival

**Manifestation** is rooted in **CREATIVITY and PLAY:**
- As children, once needs are met, we create
- We play, we build, we express, we make things
- This is natural manifestation—creating for the joy of it

**These biological roots are important because they reveal:**

**If you're stuck in attraction (always needing, always trying to get), you're stuck in infant consciousness.**

**Healthy adult consciousness includes both: attracting what you need AND manifesting what you can create.**

### The Projection Problem

**How we experienced our parents giving us things shapes how we expect to receive from the world.**

If parents gave conditionally ("I'll give you this IF you behave"):
- You expect the world/universe to give conditionally
- You think you must "be good" to receive
- You believe you must earn everything

If parents gave unpredictably (sometimes yes, sometimes no, no clear pattern):
- You expect the world/universe to be unpredictable
- You don't trust that you can attract what you need
- You live in constant uncertainty about receiving

If parents gave resentfully (giving but making you feel guilty):
- You expect to feel guilty for receiving
- You sabotage your attraction
- You feel unworthy of having

**We PROJECT our parent experience onto society, culture, government, and even the universe/God.**

**Before you try to manifest, understand your current attraction/manifestation system:**
- How did you receive as a child?
- What did you learn about getting needs met?
- What patterns are you unconsciously repeating?

### The Soul and Body Fight: Survival vs. Freedom

**Your soul and body are constantly fighting to survive.**

Here's a profound paradox:

**The breath you take—the air you breathe—is both what gives you life AND what destroys your body.**

**Breath is POISON to matter.**

Oxygen creates oxidation. Oxidation breaks down matter. **The very thing keeping you alive is also slowly killing you.**

**This is the fundamental tension of existence:**

The body needs to survive (attract resources, maintain form).

The soul seeks to be free (transcend limitation, create beyond need).

**Breath represents this paradox:**
- You need it to live (body)
- It destroys you over time (matter)
- It connects you to freedom (soul)

### Freedom from Need = Death (The Little Death)

**True freedom from need is DEATH.**

When you no longer need anything—no breath, no food, no warmth, no safety—you're dead.

**But there's a "little death" we can experience in life:**

**ORGASM.**

**In the moment of orgasm, you experience complete freedom from need.**

For those seconds:
- You don't need food
- You don't need safety
- You don't need anything
- You're completely FREE

**This is why orgasm is called "the little death" (la petite mort)—it's a momentary experience of being completely free from need, which is what death is.**

**This moment of pleasure is the soul tasting freedom from the body's constant needs.**

### The Five Elements Create Manifestation

The **Five Elements Code** teaches how manifestation happens from subtle to dense:

**1. ETHER (Vitality)**: The spark of existence, the impulse to be

**2. WATER (Information)**: The flow of knowing, data moving

**3. FIRE (Manifestation)**: The power of creation, energy forming

**4. AIR (Freedom)**: The breath of liberation, space to exist

**5. EARTH (Foundation)**: The ground of being, stability in form

**Manifestation moves through all five:**

Vitality (ether) carries information (water) which creates through fire, breathes with freedom (air), and grounds in reality (earth).

**If any element is missing, manifestation is incomplete:**

- No ether = no vitality, no life force
- No water = no information, no direction
- No fire = no creation, no manifestation
- No air = no freedom, suffocation
- No earth = no grounding, no stability

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch your body. Yawn. Cross your limbs.

Relax your body, focusing on your breathing.

**Notice your breath—the paradox of it:** It gives you life and destroys your matter simultaneously.

### Becoming Wind

Start to perceive the air coming inside your body.

Feel how it moves inside you, making you feel like you are empty.

Only air and wind is spinning within you. Feel the air around your body connecting with the air within your body.

**This breath is freedom and limitation, life and death, all at once.**

### The Soul's Energy

Perceive the energy of your body moving like wind within your body in a spiral of colors.

Expressing outside through the skin like a twister around you.

### Illuminating the Root

Put your hands facing the sky at the height of your heart.

Perceive the light of the I Am, of the sun, coming towards you, going through the crown and anchoring in your root chakra at the base of your spine with a beautiful red color.

**The root—your foundation, your survival, your vitality.**

Feel the red light filling your root, grounding you to earth, connecting you to life force.

Feel this light flowing down into your legs, into the earth, and then back up into your hands, filling them with vital red light.

### Integration: Understanding Your Current System

**Before we work with attraction and manifestation, we must understand your current system:**

**Think about your parents (or primary caregivers):**

How did they give you what you needed?
- Freely and lovingly?
- Conditionally?
- Resentfully?
- Unpredictably?

**This is your blueprint for how you expect to receive from the world.**

**Acknowledge this pattern without judgment.** It's not your fault. It's what you learned.

### Attraction in One Hand

**In one hand, hold ATTRACTION:**

The pull toward yourself, bringing resources from outside to inside, receiving what you need.

**Feel your needs:** For security, for resources, for support, for energy.

**These needs are not bad. They're biological. They're real.**

### Manifestation in the Other Hand

**In your other hand, hold MANIFESTATION:**

The expression outward, creating something new, giving from inside to outside.

**Feel your creative power:** To make, to build, to express, to give.

**This creativity is not selfish. It's biological. It's natural.**

### Understanding the Flow

**Attraction without manifestation** = taking without giving, accumulating without creating, needing without expressing.

This creates stagnation, guilt, emptiness.

**Manifestation without attraction** = giving without receiving, creating without resources, expressing without foundation.

This creates depletion, burnout, collapse.

**BOTH together in FLOW** = attract what you need, use it to create, share what you create, attract more based on your new vibration.

This creates vitality, purpose, abundance.

### Checking Your Vibration

**Ask yourself honestly:**

**What am I actually vibrating at right now?**

Not what I'm thinking. Not what I'm wishing for. Not what I'm visualizing.

**What is my BEING vibrating?**

- Fear or trust?
- Scarcity or abundance?
- Unworthiness or value?
- Need or creativity?

**You will attract whatever you're vibrating.**

**If you want to attract something different, you must BECOME a different vibration.**

### Releasing Accumulation

**What are you hoarding? What are you accumulating without using?**

- Money you're afraid to spend or invest?
- Knowledge you're afraid to share?
- Love you're afraid to give?
- Energy you're afraid to express?

**Stagnant energy becomes toxic.**

**Let it FLOW.** Use what you've attracted. Manifest. Create. Give.

**When energy flows through you, more comes.**

### Unification: Vital Energy

Take both hands to your root chakra, bringing attraction and manifestation together as one flow.

**This is VITAL ENERGY—life force flowing in and out, receiving and giving, attracting and creating.**

Unify with the vibration:

**SSfuni... SSfuni... SSfuni... SSfuni...**

**"I Am the Flux of Life."**

Life flows through me—in and out, receiving and giving, needing and creating. I am not a container to fill. I am a channel for flow.

### The Little Death: Moment of Freedom

**If you're comfortable, bring your awareness to the sensation of pleasure, of freedom from need.**

That moment when you want nothing, need nothing, are complete.

**This is the "little death"—freedom from the body's constant needs.**

**The soul tastes this freedom and remembers: I am more than my needs.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and start to spread this consciousness, stretching, caressing, and yawning.

Come back here and now, opening your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Check Your Vibration Honestly

**Stop "trying to manifest" for one week.**

Instead, **check your actual vibration every day:**

**Morning check:**
- What am I vibrating right now? (Not thinking—BEING)
- Fear or trust?
- Scarcity or abundance?
- Unworthiness or value?
- Need or creativity?

**Throughout the day:**
- Notice when your vibration shifts
- What triggers scarcity vibration?
- What triggers abundance vibration?
- What are you BEING, not just thinking?

**Evening reflection:**
- What did I attract today?
- Does it match my actual vibration (not my wishes)?
- Am I seeing the law of resonance in action?

**You'll discover: You're already manifesting perfectly based on your vibration. The question is: Do you want to change your vibration?**

### Understanding Your Receiving Blueprint

**Journal about your parent/caregiver patterns:**

**How did they give you what you needed?**
- Freely, lovingly, generously?
- Conditionally ("only if you...")?
- Resentfully (giving but making you feel guilty)?
- Unpredictably (sometimes yes, sometimes no)?
- Scarcely (not enough to go around)?

**How does this pattern show up now?**
- Do you feel you must "be good" to receive?
- Do you expect unpredictability from universe/life?
- Do you feel guilty for receiving?
- Do you believe there's never enough?

**This is your unconscious manifestation blueprint.**

**You can change it—but first you must SEE it clearly.**

### Practice Flow, Not Accumulation

**What have you been accumulating (hoarding) without using?**

**Money:** Are you saving but never investing/using/circulating?

**Knowledge:** Are you learning but never teaching/sharing?

**Love:** Are you receiving but not giving?

**Energy:** Are you resting but never creating?

**Choose one area and PRACTICE FLOW this week:**

- Use some of the money you've been saving
- Share some of the knowledge you've been hoarding
- Give some of the love you've been withholding
- Create something with the energy you've been storing

**Notice: When you release flow, more comes in.**

Stagnant energy = no space for new energy.  
Flowing energy = creates vacuum that draws in more.

### Manifestation as Service, Not Accumulation

**Reframe your manifestation practice:**

Instead of: "What can I attract FOR MYSELF?"

Ask: "What can I create that SERVES OTHERS?"

**When you manifest to serve (not just to accumulate), you:**
- Create fruits/seeds for others
- Participate in natural flow
- Align with how energy actually moves
- Attract more resources because you're using them

**The tree doesn't attract sunlight to hoard it. The tree attracts sunlight to create oxygen, shade, fruit.**

**Be like the tree.**

### The "Little Death" Practice

**Recognize moments of freedom from need in your daily life:**

Not just orgasm (though that's the clearest example), but:

- Deep laughter that makes you forget everything
- Flow state in creativity where time disappears
- Moments of awe/beauty where you want nothing
- Meditation when you're complete as you are
- Connection with another where nothing else matters

**These are glimpses of freedom from the body's constant needs.**

**The soul remembers: I am more than survival. I am more than need. I am freedom expressing through form.**

**Savor these moments. They remind you of your true nature.**

## Q&A

### Q: If I'm vibrating at scarcity, how do I change my vibration to abundance when I don't have abundance?

**You don't need to HAVE abundance to VIBRATE abundance.** Vibration is not about circumstances—it's about your BEING. Abundance vibration = knowing you're valuable, trusting the flow, recognizing what you already have, feeling grateful, believing in your creativity. You can be broke financially and vibrate abundance. You can be wealthy financially and vibrate scarcity. Change your vibration through practice (gratitude, trust, self-worth), and circumstances will follow.

### Q: Isn't "manifestation" just magical thinking that ignores real-world limitations?

**Real-world limitations exist. AND manifestation works within reality, not against it.** Manifestation is not "think positive and physics disappears." It's: change your vibration → change what you attract (people, opportunities, resources, ideas) → take action with those new resources → create different results. You're not magically conjuring money from thin air. You're becoming someone who resonates with abundance, which attracts abundant opportunities, which you then USE to create.

### Q: What if I need to accumulate (save money, store food) for security?

**There's a difference between wise preparation and fearful hoarding.** Saving for known future needs (retirement, emergencies) = wise preparation and part of flow. Accumulating without limit because you're terrified there will never be enough = fearful hoarding that blocks flow. Ask: Is this accumulation based on realistic planning or on fear? If fear—work on the vibration. If planning—continue, but also keep energy flowing (use some, give some, create some).

### Q: How do I know what I'm "resonating" vs what I'm just thinking/wishing?

**Your results tell you.** What are you attracting in your life right now? That's what you're resonating. Not what you wish you were attracting—what you're ACTUALLY attracting. Look at your relationships, your money situation, your opportunities, your experiences. They're mirrors of your vibration. If you don't like what you see, change the vibration (not by thinking differently, but by BEING differently through practice, healing, growth).

### Q: What about manifesting for others (like healing or helping someone)?

**You can't manifest FOR someone else—you can only create conditions and offer resources.** If you manifest healing energy, wisdom, or resources and OFFER them to someone, they must resonate with receiving/using them for it to help. You can't force manifestation on another person. You can create and offer; they must attract and receive. Focus on manifesting what you can create, then offering it freely without attachment to whether they take it.

### Q: Isn't the parent projection thing just blaming parents for our problems?

**No—it's understanding patterns without blame.** Your parents gave what they could with what they had. Their patterns came from THEIR parents. It's generational. Understanding the pattern helps you see it clearly so you can CHANGE it consciously, not repeat it unconsciously. This isn't blame; it's liberation. You're not a victim of the pattern—you're the one who can break it.

### Q: The "little death" teaching seems to make everything about pleasure/orgasm. Is that the point?

**No—pleasure/orgasm is just the clearest EXAMPLE of freedom from need.** The point is: you can experience moments of complete freedom (from wanting, needing, seeking) while alive. These moments show you that you're more than your survival drives, more than your constant needs. Orgasm is one doorway to this experience. Meditation is another. Creativity is another. Awe is another. The teaching is about recognizing freedom, not about sex.

### Q: If manifestation is about flow, should I never save or plan, just give everything away?

**No—flow includes WISE USE, not just immediate giving away.** The tree doesn't drop all its fruits immediately; it ripens them, drops them at the right time, keeps enough energy to survive winter. Flow means energy MOVES—it comes in, you use it wisely (which includes planning, saving, investing), and it goes out (which includes creating, giving, sharing). Stagnation is when energy comes in and STOPS—hoarded forever, never used, never flowing. Use your discernment about timing and wise use.

## Closing Reflection

Today we've explored **Attraction and Manifestation**—two concepts that have been heavily distorted by modern capitalism and "Law of Attraction" culture.

**The Law of Attraction is actually the Law of Resonance:**

You don't attract what you want, wish for, or think about.

**You attract what you RESONATE with—what matches your actual vibration, your BEING.**

**If you want to attract something different, you must BECOME a different vibration.**

Not through forced positive thinking, but through genuine transformation of your being—your beliefs, your self-worth, your trust, your energy.

**Attraction and manifestation are not about accumulation:**

They're not about getting and keeping, hoarding and controlling.

**They're about FLOW:**

Attract what you need → Use it → Create something → Share it → Attract more

**Like a tree:** Attracts water and sunlight → Uses them to grow → Creates oxygen and fruit → Feeds the ecosystem → Attracts more resources

**Stagnant energy becomes toxic. Flowing energy brings life.**

**We carry blueprints from our parents** about how to receive, how to expect resources, how to relate to giving and getting.

Understanding these blueprints (without blame) helps us change them consciously instead of repeating them unconsciously.

**The profound paradox:** Your soul and body are in constant tension.

The breath that gives you life is the same breath that destroys your matter.

Freedom from need is death—but we can taste "little deaths" (orgasm, flow states, moments of awe) where we experience complete freedom from wanting while still alive.

**These moments remind us: We are more than our survival needs. We are more than our constant seeking.**

**The Five Elements** show us how manifestation moves from subtle to dense: Vitality (ether) → Information (water) → Creation (fire) → Freedom (air) → Foundation (earth).

All five are needed for complete manifestation.

**"I Am the Flux of Life."**

Life flows through you—not to you, not from you, but THROUGH you.

You are not a container to fill and keep full.

You are a channel for energy to flow—receiving and giving, attracting and creating, in constant circulation.

**Your work is not to grab and hold. Your work is to resonate, receive, use, create, share.**

**Be like the tree. Be the flow.**

See you tomorrow for Day 78, as we continue the Emotional Week.

Rest well. Drink water. Let energy flow.
