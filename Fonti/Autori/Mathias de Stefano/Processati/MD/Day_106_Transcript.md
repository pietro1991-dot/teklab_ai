## Introduction

Hi everyone. To everyone who is the light cut off.

So we were now the light.

So it was just for two seconds , but the transmission. . . Anyway , so.

. . I do n't know what happened , really. Anyway , Oh good now.

So good , funny , good noon , and good evening.

So this is. . . What happened you do it , life 's turning , and organized by an Argentine.

You never know where it 's going to happen. Topic for today is. . .

I progress. I am a little bit tired , so this is why I 'm so slow.

So I will take it there , calm , tourism , and how it goes slow.

So the topic for today is hypocrisy. And this is something really important for our times , because through our history and mostly these times we are living now. I guess I 've got something very common , because everyone wants to be something different to show a different appearance. And first you are all of us , in some moments of our lives , have been hypocrites.

So of course , that for us , hypocrisy is something really wrong , and it 's bad , because it means to show something that we are not.

So it 's basically to lie. We usually think that hypocrisy is something bad , and for bad people , because we relate hypocrisy with the people that is lying to us , to manipulate us , or because they want to. . .

To manipulate , to control. To lie , but mostly hypocrisy is not about to manipulate the other with the lie , but it 's much more about to be accepted. This is why we all , all of us , in our lives , in such a way we are hypocrites , because somehow in some places , in some moments , we want to be accepted. And the reason why we look for acceptance , sorry.

The light came , and so all the machines start to work again.

So what I was saying is that animals , we are. . . We look for.

. . Because I was saying that. .

. Are looking for acceptance , because they need to survive.

So they need to be accepted. If they want to keep. . .

Translating , to keep living in our. . . In this reality , in this life.

Of course , to understand how this works , hypocrisy works , we should go back to the very origin of our animal kingdom. This is because all the tools that we have to be , why we are now , have been created from it.

So even if we are working here for this reality , even if we are working here in. . . In this reality in consciousness , the tools that we.

. . The tools that we choose to be here to work here is the biology. This is why we need to understand the origin of our biology.

To understand the tools that today.

So today we have problems with the light. It is counting , so maybe the internet is also setting.

So the reason why we have to go to the origin of the biology , constantly is because even if we are working here for the consciousness and for the. . . For the spirituality , the tools that we used to make to do so.

. . Is biological.

So we have to understand the tool and the origin of those tools.

So we can know how to use it.

So remember that the organisms , the. . . Unicellular , cellular organism.

When it is evolving , we are trying to adapt. It gets information from the outside and stimulates that information. And then it becomes in another thing , like multi-cellular beings. And they also simulate information within.

So when they start to assimilate all that data , all that information , they create patterns.

So we create patterns. Patterns are the way in which you assimilate information in biology. You create patterns in order to know how to adapt and develop in the world.

So patterns will be the tools that we use and we assimilate to adapt to the environment and to develop in environment. Picture now the idea of an animal that is trying to. . .

That is in the water , the lips in the water. And so it 's like kind of a fish. And sadly it stops raining. There 's no water begins to draw.

And the water goes down.

So that little animal needs to adapt to the new environment.

So it needs to learn how to walk on the ground and in the air. That adaptation to the environment , it is the one that will allow the beam to survive.

So basically this means that in order to survive the animals must stop being what they are and be something that they are not to adapt to the new environment. And this makes that animals must change the texture of skin. Must change the colors , the shapes.

So this means that they must answer to the new world with different shields. This shields we transform them through thousands and billions of years.

So through thousands of years humans we have been changing also to adapt to the environment. But this brought us to a moment where we had to evolve with the mind.

So we develop the brain to be intelligent. And by intelligence we discover creativity. We discover imagination and we start to use it as a tool for evolution. To adapt to the environment.

In this way not only we were using shields in our physical reality but we also started to create shields in the emotional and the mental.

## Q&A

So those shields in our soul , in the motion and the mind we call them masks.

So as little animals as little animals. The mouse is for example. They learn how to they learn to fake. They learn to fake to pretend that they are dead.

So the other animals say , oh this is dead so it is not good.

So they moved in the other way.

So the little mouse survived.

So through thousands of years humans we also learn how to do that to pretend to fake. By mind.

So we could also survive in the environment.

So in nature disability is called semitism. And in society this quality is called hypocrisy.

So the origin of the word hypocrisy is he posts that means under and of course mask. And critics that means answer.

So hypocrisy is the ability to answer by being hoped.

So hypocrisy in its concept of evolution is not something bad. Is it true for survival? And everyone use hypocrisy to adapt. Because the first hypocrisy that humans does in their lives is to try to imitate mom and that.

The reason why we have to. We are hypocrisy. Hipocrite. We 're.

Mom and dad is because. We need to be accepted by the clan. The hurt. If we are not accepted by them.

So this means that we are not gon na survive. Our self believe that. Throughout our lives. We will have to be high-pocrits.

Hipocrite. Consumably. Because we need to adapt to a group. The only ones that are not hypocrites.

In. In the human species. Are. The autistic people.

And the kids of friend people. And the reason why. These two groups is because these two groups. They do n't understand about.

To get adapted to other groups. To the. To socialite.

So by nature we are all. Hipocrite. All of us. You.

Me. Everyone. We are all. Hipocrite.

By nature. Think it. About a moment. We.

Usually. We. It. It.

It hurts to last when. When someone says you are. Hypocrisy. Because.

You are used to the concept of. Hypocrisy. It. Lying.

So there 's. You do n't need to lie to be a hypocrisy. What. What you just need to do is.

The need of acceptance. And I will try to be. Very. Clear.

So you can. See how. Hipocrite. How.

Hipocrite. You all are. We are. We all are.

When you enter a place. You say. Good morning. When someone helps you.

You say. Thank you.

So. If you do so. You are. Hypocrisy.

And the reason why we do that. Is because we have been taught. To. To treat the other well.

So the others can accept us. All the. Formative of the culture are hypocrites.

So now. Let 's try to think about. It 's it 's a bad thing to say. Good morning.

It 's a bad thing to say. Thank you. This is a tool for. Harmony to be all.

Connected. In a good way. This is why. Even if I have the worst day ever.

And I want to kill someone. When I get inside a place. I would say. Good morning.

So usually. For example , when you walk around. And somebody asked you , hey , how are you? Nobody says I am really sad.

Do you have two hours to talk? There 's no many people that do that.

So we use. Hypocrisy as a way of acceptance.

So we could survive in a society. This is not bad. This is good. This is a good hypocrisy.

Because you are just. Using the tools of the society to. To work together to. Just.

Share. To be in harmony with the rest. This. To be in harmony with the rest.

This fine. There 's no problem with that. The hypocrisy. That.

It 's kind of bad. That is. Not aligned. Is the hypocrisy that you 're used to take a benefit from others.

That you use. To. To take something. That 's.

Bi manipulated them.

So the hypocrisy. That um. Mix us. Leave.

. In harmony with the rest. With the society. Is something.

. . . But then we have the other one.

One that I use others on my own benefit and that 's the one that we have to calibrated. We usually use both of them because we always want to take benefit from someone or something. We 're going to call them the good high-bocoursier or the bad high-bocoursier. We will call it the evolution hypocrisy which is the one that we use because of evolution.

So this hypocrisy , the example would be you come to someone and say , hey , how are you? And you do n't want to ask it. I do n't want to know how the other is. But you ask , how are you?

And the other one will say , hey , I 'm fine. But no , he 's not fine.

Okay.

So that 's something that we usually do. That we usually use as an evolution hypocrisy. And I just want to clarify this because I do n't want to see people now saying , I wo n't ask anyone else now. How are you or saying , I 'm fine because that 's hypocrisy.

No , listen carefully. It 's an evolution hypocrisy. Evolution hypocrisy is useful for the society.

Okay. That 's it. It 's good. It 's something that you use by culture.

There 's nothing wrong with that.

Now the example for the bad hypocrisy will be you have other people talking about the consciousness. And they are talking , oh yeah , today the consciousness is very important because of blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , like this. And you come to the group and you have no idea about consciousness. Anything.

No clue. And you just sit there and say , oh yes , oh consciousness , I know a lot about that. That 's it. You are lying because you know that is not like that.

Okay.

So you just make yourself pretend that you know. But that 's not true. Look at this. That when we usually think about hypocrisy immediately we say , oh yes , in my country politicians are hypocrites.

I do n't know. The businessmen are hypocrites. But no , no , no , no , that 's not like that. Politicians and all these people that you may call hypocrites , they were to the same schools that you did.

They went to they had a mom and a dad. They also had the same culture. They went through the same streets. They grew up like you.

So they are not hypocrites. The culture is hypocrites.

So do n't point at anyone saying , oh , that one and this one because as they say , when you point with one finger , there are three of them pointing to you.

So basically hypocrisy tells me to protect the most weak part of myself and protect it with the shield to make it to make me fake as strong outside. And all this comes from patterns. If you remember where we said before , when I learned how to use my patterns , I just learned how to use hypocrisy in a way that is not anymore false.

So , and is example of how we use the hypocrisy today , it 's to understand that we usually become what we created for ourselves. Like when you just acknowledge that you have a tool which is a hammer for example , and a hypocrisy will say , oh , I have a hammer.

So I am a hammer. I am the hammer guy.

So I will go all around the world saying , I am a hammer. I am a hammer.

So you will end up putting the nails with your head thinking that you are a hammer.

Okay , so you start to believe that you are the tool that you have. And you break your head.

So what we usually do is when we recognize , oh , now I know I am not hammer. And I got hurt because I thought I was a hammer.

So I am not a hammer. And then you take the hammer and say , to the hell with the hammer and you throw the hammer away.

So now you have anything. And no , what you have to learn is how to use the hammer , not to become the hammer , but to use it properly.

So hypocrisy would be to become the tool. But when you become aware of the tool , the way you get rid of hypocrisy is by knowing how to use the tool instead of becoming the tool. You understood the difference.

So that would be the moment when you become aware that that moment that day when you walk by the streets and someone asked you , hey , how are you? You will be able to say , not very good today , but thanks for asking. Anyway , I want to speak about it now.

So there you used hypocrisy , the social hypocrisy because you say thank you. But you are not. You are just being coherent. You are coherent with what is happening with you.

With the truth.

So now you have the other group that we are talking about the consciousness. Oh , consciousness and love of love and you get there and you want to be part of the group. But you say instead of saying , oh , yes , I know about that. You just say , oh , I never heard about it.

Can you explain me? And you become part of the group that just asking without the fear of not knowing just being honest.

So the important thing about this today is to recognize that everything that we have that we know should not be taken from the morality or the cultural point of view. Because everything that we use in our life is a concept concept. If we take the concepts from their pretty concepts , so we are going to be trapped , not willing to transform.

So do n't be afraid of being hypocrisy , how hypocrites. Just be aware of the reason why you are being in it and how can you use it in a good way. One of the main paradox of the conscious society would be trying to not be hypocrisy being it at the same time. All the time when we are trying to see what is bad outside , we lose a lot of time and unseen what is bad inside of us.

Just as an artist , trying not to say , I never , or I have never , or I will never , or I do n't. And if people say that , it 's because in the subconscious there is a tiny part that is thinking of the possibility of that. Never say never , one of the main paths to find coherence is to never be close to anything. Because coherence is to be open to every process of learning and mistakes are great teachers.

## Daily Practice Elements

The vibration for today is view. The statement for today is my own transformation of patterns. The goal for today is the tenth dimension. From the void of potentially , the tenth dimension is the same unity created from projections of the universal mind.

From previous experiences. Here , universes are created with their own unique new laws , where everything created by the previous cosmos has the possibility of manifesting their own. Like in a world like in a world of dreams and unlimited imagination. We begin to move shoulders softly.

I focus on my breathing , relaxing body and letting all the way fall down. Take a deep breath , receiving all the light around. I become aware of all the people around me , all those I know , the good ones from the bad ones for me. I feel the light that emerges from me , just around them.

All equally. I perceive them being part of my own body , of my own mind. Thus , this notion in which each person is a wave and taking the breath and dying to the depth of this ocean. I observe the light , vanishing the book , aside , becomes surrounded by the shadows of my subconscious.

I become the inside of these darkness. I become aware thinking about my hypocrisy. What are my biggest hypocrisy in life? Take a deep breath.

## Q&A

I said the intention. I desire to set myself free from my back and see. I desire to take all my mask off.

So I could be why really. I activate the sensation of my sound. I am the transplantation of patterns. I am the transplantation of patterns.
