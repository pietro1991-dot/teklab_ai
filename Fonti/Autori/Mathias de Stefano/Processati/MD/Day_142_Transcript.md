## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning and good afternoon. Good night.

So just before we start something to tell you that tomorrow I know that well tomorrow is Christmas I guess because some people say that the 25th is Christmas so but tomorrow night start Christmas.

So I know that is a moment to be with the family , to be with your own and so maybe we are not going to be as many as we are every day but just wanted to let you know that I would do the alignment anyway as always. I would be there as here as every day.

So no one would be offended if a lot of people does n't come up. If we are only three so do n't worry.

So you are going to do the alignment in another moment. Also I would try to be very , I would try to speak a little bit. I would try. I would try.

I would do my best to speak a little bit. I do n't know how would you feel but since yesterday we are feeling very tired. Like the body is really tired. We can feel like if we want to sleep all day.

And today also not feeling tired today but we are like if we were sailing on a boat in the ocean and we are feeling like diary right now.

So we are also I guess today we are receiving another solar flare.

So we are maybe a little bit processing all this information from this day.

So I guess it will be like this for this three days.

So it 's normal to feel like this because we are trying to adjust. We are like configuring the new energy so it 's normal to feel like we are in the body. We are in the body like maybe the motions. The thinking , the thoughts maybe I do n't know.

For any person would be different but this in the three bodies. This is like the reset of our connection , the connection that we all have between us.

So I remind you that today we are still in the physical week of Sagittarius. And I remind you also that we are not doing this , this tree of consciousness. We are not doing this by the central astrology neither the tropical astrology. We are following the month of the Atlanta calendar that was related to the names of the month.

So we are still in the month of Sagittarius.

So it 's not about specifically astrology , it 's about the name of the month. As we are in the month of Sagittarius and the physical week , this is why we are starting our journey through the earth.

So remember that one of the attributes of Sagittarius in the physical aspect is the traveling the journeys through life through the earth. Looking for destined.

So traveling is one of the keys of this is why in this week we are traveling through the earth day by day.

The reason why we are traveling through earth is not just to know earth is because we need to know the trackers of the planet. We need to know how to relate with this to understand this parts of the planet because we are this planet.

So we are earth. And in order to live fully present in earth , we have to acknowledge to think about the earth as a body.

So this is how we are going through our bodies , through our charts , aligning by the charts of the planet.

So the goal of this week is to recognize that we are the body of earth.

The reason why we are going to speak about this about each one of the continents and the regions of the planet is because we have to remember that we are not leaving on a planet. That we are the planet.

So it does n't matter if you know or you 've never been in some places. We are even though part of this world.

So every continent , every region of this planet is like a part of our own body.

So when we understand that we see the earth in that way , we are able to live fully in this reality.

So today we are in the third eye and third eye is South America.

## Energy Work

So remember that this here , the crown of the planet is Antarctica. This is Antarctica , okay?

So you have Antarctica here. And we were laughing because I just want to say that this finger here is the Antarctic Peninsula , but it looks like a chicken.

So imagine , use your imagination and you will see Antarctica and here. And so if here is the Antarctic Peninsula , so we have here South America , Patagonia from here and then the rest of the continent , okay? All this region. First of all , I was just saying that we have the Antarctic Plateau , yes?

The tonic plate here of Antarctica. And then we have the South American Plateau , yes? Here. In the middle we have a tiny plateau under the sea that separates both continents.

And that is called the plateau of Scotia.

So this plateau generates a lot of energy. And now let 's think about this. Because when I am going to explain this , for sure a lot of people will say , but how is possible if this organism here or there? And just for you to know , the Earth is not organized exactly as a human , okay?

We are totally different.

So the way in which we are is all separate , but the Earth is all like this.

So that 's why it 's not exactly as a human , okay? It 's all like kind of mixed.

So you have to take this in count to understand what I am going to say. The same way in which we have bones and joints. Yes , the Earth also have bones and joints. And we call them tectonic plateaus.

If we know now that these are the joints , yes , if the tectonic plateaus are the joints of the planet and the bones of the planet.

So now we can understand that some of these plateaus they mixed one to another , okay? And they push one another from one side to another , or some of them goes below or above the other one , okay?

So these movements of these joints of these tectonic plates , they push the cross of the planet and they create the mountains.

So as high as highest the mountains , you can see that there is this tectonic joints , okay?

So you have this big mountains and that means that below of it you usually have another tectonic plate below , okay? Also what happened is that these two can just create so much pressure that breaks the tectonic plateaus. They break each other. Opening places for the inner fire of the planet in the magma , coming out.

So that 's what creates volcanoes.

So we can find chains of mountains or chains of volcanoes in the spots where these bones and joints of the planet are together.

So now you can understand what happened in the joints of the planet by just doing this. You stretch when you do this and you listen to the cracker like this , how do you feel? You feel more relaxed. Well , these movements , cracker , cracker are the air squares for the planet , but it 's just the planet doing like , cracker , cracker , yes?

So it 's the planet relaxing , basically.

So this is just to understand also that as above , so below as huge also the tiny , that for example , I have this thing of doing cracker with my fingers. I know a lot of people hate that.

Sorry , it 's my thing.

So I can not , I can not help , I can not help it.

So imagine that the liquid that we have here being like cities , okay?

So when I do this , it 's like all this cities moving and having the earth 's quake like , oh my josh.

So now imagine that the earth is doing exactly the same with its fingers and the cities are worried and they say , oh my god , what is happening? This happening , why it happens to us and basically the earth is just doing crack and relaxing herself is all about perception.

So I know that this is difficult , but the next time you feel an earthquake just relax because the earth is stretching.

Now think about this , besides all the continents , all the bones that chronic plates that we have , they all are connected somehow because the plates are here of the shoulder , the arms , the hip , everything is connected. And how is connected because of the spine.

So the spine gives flexibility movement and stability to all the rest of the bones.

So this spine is made up with 33 vertebrae that they just move and gives flexibility. As we grow up , we have not 33 , we have less because some of them get united , but in the moment when we are born , we have this 33.

So this spine is also in the planet and it 's something that goes through the spine of the world going through every one of the bones of the plates of the press of the planet.

So it moves the flexibility of each continent and you can find it across every chain of biggest mountains in the world.

So I just said to look for a map where I explain this in English , so you can you can check it so you find it.

So the spine of earth begins in the mountains that we call the transantarctic chain , the transantarctic mountains. From those mountains , they go to the Antarctic Peninsula and it goes down into the ocean by the Scotia plate rising up in the sandwich islands. From the sandwich islands it goes back to South America in the aradelfuego. And from the aradelfuego it starts to go up by the Andes , the Andes mountains.

So it goes all through the Andes mountains and then when it arrives to Colombia and Venezuela , it opens into one goes to , it opens into surrounding the plateau , the the tectonic plateau of the Caribbean , the Caribbean , plateau.

So one goes through the Central America and the other one goes to Antennas , I do n't know how to say in English , the Articles Articles , okay , whatever.

So all the islands and until Cuba. From there they get together again in Mexico , in Mexico City , okay , in the volcanoes of that region.

## Q&A

So it goes up together again through Mexico United States in the West and then Canada and it goes to Alaska , it crawl the allusions islands and it gets again into into come Chalk in Russia and from come Chalk , it divides into again going down through Japan and up. It goes to , I guess , the Kronowski mountains.

So they go that way and they connect again in the in the Bicarlic in Russia and from there they open a little bit again to create the tibet and the alt mountains. And from the south they create the Himalayas , okay , so the Himalayas and the alta get together again in the Cárcordum and from the Cárcordum they start to create the mountains of savourous in Iran.

So from Iran it arrives to Turkey , okay , and Turkey and Atomic is the place where this chain divides in three , this training team. One up is the Ural Mountains in Russia , the other one down which is the mountains that divides Africa , the western Africa and eastern Africa until the mountains , the volcanoes in Kenya in the south and the other one goes towards the center crossing the Cárcordum islands , the Cárcordum Mountains , the always mountains. And the alta Mediterranean crossing towards the Users and the Users goes up again to Iceland and from Iceland it goes down into the crossed of the planet in the north pole.

So all that is basically the chain that we call the spine of the world.

So in this planet we as humans take the north pole as the place where we are all looking for as the place that is on the top because we all roll ourselves by the magnetic aspect of the world which goes to the north.

So but from the point of view of the universe is the south from where everything comes. And here 's when we have to understand in astrology , if you know astrology or if you are studying at the astrology you will have listened that besides the sun , the moon , the rising sun. We have also the north note and the south note.

Okay in our charts.

So the south note , the south note is the one that tells me from where I come from and what do I have within already integrated inside of me. And the north one is telling me where I am heading to where am I going what I am going to do. What I have to learn in the future.

So let 's speak about this from the universal point of view. And if you have the universe , our south note is unity because we come from the spiritual levels we come from the spiritual realms. We are coming from the origin of the universe.

So what we have integrated within ourselves is the unity is something that we have. That we have inside because we come from there.

So where am I going to? I am here to manifest the unity by duality to create to be myself a creator.

So I need to work with the polarity , I need to divide to create to manifest et cetera. From the point of view of the earth , not the human point of view , the earth point of view , the spirit comes from Antarctica because it 's the south.

So from there comes the energy of the spirit and it 's going to the north because it 's trying to find the creation is trying to leave the reality.

So that 's why we are heading to the north to manifest , to create. But we have to remember that the south , the south pole Antarctica , is the place that reminds us our origins , the axis of our essence.

## Energy Work

So now picture this , that the people that is looking for the ligament to look for the connection with the spirit. We need to Kundalini from the root chara going up.

So we would have to start by the by Africa going to Antarctica to create this this connection with the divine with the spirit.

So from from the point of view of our matter. Looking for alignment we have to go up activating the Kundalini from the root chara.

So from the point of view of the spirit , the Kundalini is the opposite. The spirit is willing to leave in this reality to manifest here.

So that 's why from the spiritual world in Antarctica it goes to the fire of the third eye. Yes , and starts to create this fire towards the opposite to the matter.

So now we can see this that when someone is from the air from the matter trying to reach the spiritual , it goes up to the crown from the root chara. But if the spiritual is trying to go into the matter , it will go from the crown to the earth. And remember the earth is not like a human. The earth has two crowns.

One crown in the south in the Antarctic representing the spiritual crown and the other one in the north , the crown representing the physical aspect of the crown.

So now if you see a map and you picture this courtyard plateau , you will see the shape of a penis. And the South American plateau will have the shape of a china.

So both together in the here is like the spirit , the spirit activating the Kundalini from that region of the planet. This is why I said think about the planet in a different way because the things are not exactly where we as humans would organize it because the tendency of the earth is to be rounded.

So the connection between the sexuality and the spirituality for the planet is exact. It 's all the same together because this planet is about creation manifestation.

So that 's why the spirituality is related with the root chara to create to manifest. This is why you may have heard the perception , the sentence that says the ecstasy of saint , I do n't know who , because the prophets , the saints and all the people in the past that we 're connecting with the spirit , they felt. They feel like if they were having an orgasm , but not a sexual orgasm , a spiritual orgasm here. And that feeling , that sensation is the one that opens the third eye and tells you , now I get it , now I can see.

And now it 's incredible that the point where this Kundalini of the spiritual realm is activated in the planet is a place that we today call Tierra del Nuevo , that means that in Spanish means the land of fire. That 's where it starts to fire. This is why in South America we connect with the third eye , the place where now I can see , I can see the fire , I can see. Right now I am not speaking about the states of South America and speaking about the tectonic plate of South America.

I am speaking about the mountains , the lakes , the nature , the fields , rivers , forest , and speaking about that. Not about Argentina , Chile , Bolivia , no. We will talk about that in another moment.

So the South American ground is the one that represents the vision in two other dimensions , in two other realities , the one that takes clarity. Not the countries.

Sometimes some original people from South America were able to assimilate the information from the earth , so they can tell and explain how that land is talking about the vision of the universe , how to connect from the earth to the vision of the whole cosmos. But some of them , they could. What I am saying about South America does n't speak about South American people. It speaks about South America , the continent.

It does n't matter where you are in the world. It does n't matter if you have been born in Australia , Asia , Europe , North America , it does n't matter. It does n't matter where you are.

South America is your vision when you connect with the earth. When you connect with the planet , your third eye is South America.

So it 's not about South American people. It 's about a continent that represents a chara in your body which is earth. It 's important to , for us to see to understand that the earth does n't have borders. It does n't have frontiers.

It does n't have nationalities. The earth is basically the whole world.

So each one of the parts of the earth is an organ inside a body. The goal that we are trying to achieve here is to remember that we are part of earth.

So when we say , I am earth and I recognize I am earth. Suddenly Antarctica becomes my crown chara and South America becomes my third eye. It does n't matter where you are. And remember that the planet is all connected.

Sometimes we think that when we go deeper into these explanations , you will see that , but how , how if South America was here , why this eye is some other place of the planet? Because the earth is not like a human. The parts of the earth are all one over the other.

So we are all connected. But we will go into that.

So this is why South America represents the vision. Where are we going to? And not as I repeat , not the countries. The earth , there , land is the one that brings you that information.

But this is the information of the future of where are we heading to. But this information is from the I am. Because it is a continent close to the spiritual to Antarctica.

So it 's about what is coming from my inner self , from the power that I have inside us , the spiritual being. It 's not about politics. It 's not about innovation in the future with technology or whatever. No , it 's not about that.

It 's about a very much deeper sight.

So one way in which we can start to bring this information back is by speaking with the original people from South America , that they have all this knowledge , but they have it from the past.

So we can have information from them to our knowledge. But then we have to transform it into another level , into another , into the new time. Because we should not come back to do exactly the same as before because that story has passed.

So it 's not about coming back to live like them. It 's about to take the essence of that in order to build something new in the future. And of course , many of the holy sacred plants are also helping a lot of people to awake.

So most of them come from South America. And another thing that the people and the lands of South America represent is flexibility. This is why South America represents a lot the queries time because of the flexibility.

The reason why I 'm here in Egypt is because in a reflection , Africa is the first mother of humanity , the one from the past. And South America is the one from the future.

So the river Nile is bringing all information for a new humanity. And all this information that I 'm receiving and doing here with you is the one that I will try to bring into the new river , the new river of the mother , the new Nile , which is in the Para river. And me myself , I was born in Argentina because of my own decision. Because I do n't have any link in history with South America.

The first time I was born in South America in my existence , I had no links , no attachments with that land.

So that 's why I decided to be born to do that there. Because I do n't have any expectations of the past of that land. I do n't have any attachment anything to solve with that land.

So that 's why I 'm , I guess I will be able to build towards the future and not because of the past in that land.

So that 's why I 'm doing this.

So let 's begin with alignment. There are many things to speak about of South America , but we will talk about that eventually. Do n't worry. The vibration for today is far.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the Celestial Consciousness. The code for today is the color of magenta. In a fast spectrum after the ultraviolet light , the magenta tones crown the coldest of the spirit. A cold capable of burning in the human perception of colors.

It 's vibration connects us with the visible spheres of the divinity. When the intensity prevents us from observing them , from serving them , but feel them. The connection with the highest subtlety. Let 's go.

I am the Celestial Consciousness. I am the Celestial Consciousness. I am the Celestial Consciousness. I am the Celestial Consciousness.

Take a deep breath , concentrate on your breathing. Breathing , see you , see you to comfort level with your body. I remember that with me , I am breaking the consciousness , the realm of all the animal and talking to them within me so I can help them to rise also their consciousness. I remember that I am standing in this incredible wide space in a white horizon.

## Guided Meditation

I remember that I am standing in this incredible wide space in a white horizon. I am standing in this incredible wide space in a white horizon. I am standing in this incredible wide space in a white horizon. I perceive the fresh air , the side breathe.

## Energy Work

I feel the cold around me. I recognize that I am in the throne of the crown. I am surrounded by the white and the light blue of this kind being the king of this celestial realm on earth. I am standing in this kind of space in a white horizon.

## Guided Meditation

I am standing in this incredible wide space in a white horizon. I am standing in this incredible wide space in a white horizon. I am missing a little myself in this cold waters. I begin to breathe stronger and faster as I feel the heat of this fire that arise in the mountains.

I feel a silent hesitate. How I can perceive the fire rising in the horizon across the sea. In front of me I see a land burning in fire. I absorb with my breathing the power of this spirit and I jump towards the fire of that land.

I see a tiny light shining. Surrounded by this fire. It is a lighthouse in the Shire. In front of me I see how the fire starts to light the whole land.

I see a rising in between the frozen mountains and the fjord of Chile. The winds of the Argentinian Patagonia. Low pushing this fire up towards the north. I see the endless rice now.

I see shining wide the Akonkawa. The salt of the uni. The pearl shining in Tito Aka. I am the snow of West Iran.

I contemplate the great plains of Argentina and Uruguay. I see a shadow of the Tito Aka. The rain forest. I see a shadow of the sea.

I see a shadow of the sea. I see a horizon towards the north. The volcanoes , the bridge in the Operator. Opening the Holy Trinity in the Great Colombia.

I see a shadow of the Tito Aka. The lightning , the three holy flames of transportation in Venezuela. Racing the shores of the Giants and Surname. I contemplate South America surrounded by light and light.

I see a light and light clashes in this. I am dying with some. I am the celestial consciousness. I am the celestial consciousness.

I am the celestial consciousness. For now I am a celestial spirit being aware of what it come become. I see I am South America. I am the Earth and South America is my greatest vision.

I am the light. I am the celestial spirit being aware of what it comes to. I am the celestial spirit being aware of what it comes to. I am the celestial spirit being aware of what it comes to.

Slowly I begin to take this consciousness from my third eye to all my body. Racing and stretching. Each one at some time come back here and now open in your eyes. Welcome to the vision of South America.

Thank you everybody for being there and as always see you tomorrow at the same time.
