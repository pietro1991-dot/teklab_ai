## Overview

On Christmas Eve 2020, we continue our journey through Earth's chakras, connecting today with South America as the planet's Third Eye - the place of vision, spiritual fire, and seeing into multiple dimensions and realities. We learn how Earth's body is organized differently from human bodies (with overlapping layers), discover why South America connects Antarctica's spiritual crown to the physical body through Kundalini fire rising from Tierra del Fuego, and understand the Atlantic calendar's view that we're in the middle of the year, not the end. This teaching prepares us for the coming Capricorn month of structure and hard work.

## Christmas Eve Context

### Tomorrow is Christmas - A Special Alignment

Tomorrow is Christmas Day, so many people will be celebrating with family. Matias will still do the alignment as always at 20:00 Egyptian time, even if fewer people attend.

**"I would try to speak a little bit, I would try."** (He knows he talks a lot!)

### Feeling the Energy Shift

**Physical sensations reported:**
- Very tired since yesterday (body really tired, want to sleep all day)
- Feeling like sailing on a boat in the ocean, feeling "diary" (dizzy)
- Probably receiving another solar flare
- Processing information from this day

**"It's normal to feel like this because we are trying to adjust. We are like configuring the new energy."**

This is the reset of our connection - the connection that we all have between each other. It's happening in all three bodies (physical, emotional, mental) - different for each person.

### Important: Following the Atlantic Calendar

**Clarification on which calendar they're using:**

**"We are NOT doing this by sidereal astrology neither tropical astrology. We are following the month of the Atlantic calendar that was related to the names of the month."**

We're still in the month of Sagittarius according to Atlantic calendar (even though tropical astrology would say otherwise).

**It's not about specifically astrology - it's about the name of the month.**

## Physical Week of Sagittarius: Traveling Through Earth

### Sagittarius Physical Aspect = Traveling and Journeys

**The theme:** One of the attributes of Sagittarius in the physical aspect is **traveling, the journeys through life, through the earth, looking for destiny.**

That's why this week we're traveling through the earth day by day, continent by continent.

### Why We're Traveling Through Earth's Body

**The goal is NOT just to know Earth - it's because:**

**"We need to know the chakras of the planet. We need to know how to relate with these parts of the planet because WE ARE this planet."**

**"So we are Earth. And in order to live fully present in Earth, we have to acknowledge to think about the Earth as a body."**

This week's goal: **Recognize that we ARE the body of Earth.**

### Earth's Body is Different from Human Bodies

**Important clarification:**

**"The Earth is NOT organized exactly as a human. We are totally different. So the way in which we are is all separate, but the Earth is all like this [overlapping]. So the way in which we are is all separate, but the Earth is all like this [overlapping]."**

**"That's why it's not exactly as a human. It's all kind of mixed."**

Some places on Earth represent TWO, THREE, or even FOUR regions of the body because it's like different layers - one layer over another.

## The Tectonic Plates: Earth's Bones and Joints

### Understanding Plate Tectonics as Body Structure

**Just like humans have bones and joints, Earth has bones and joints - and we call them tectonic plates.**

**How it works:**
- Tectonic plates = joints and bones of the planet
- These plates move against each other
- Some push one against another from one side to another
- Some go below or above the other one
- These movements push the crust and create mountains

**So:** As high as the mountains, you can see tectonic joints below. The highest mountains mean another tectonic plate below, creating pressure.

### When Plates Break: Volcanoes

When two plates create so much pressure that they break each other, they **open places for the inner fire of the planet (magma) to come out**.

That's what creates volcanoes.

**So we can find:** Chains of mountains OR chains of volcanoes where these bones and joints are together.

### Earthquakes = Earth Stretching

**The beautiful analogy:**

**"When you do this [stretch fingers], you feel the cracker sound. How do you feel? You feel more relaxed."**

**"These movements - cracker, cracker - are the earthquakes for the planet. It's just the planet doing like cracker, cracker. It's the planet relaxing, basically."**

**Matias has a habit of cracking his fingers. He imagines:**

**"The liquid we have here [in joints] is like cities. When I do this, it's like all these cities moving and having the earthquake like 'oh my gosh.' So the Earth is doing exactly the same with its fingers and the cities are worried saying 'oh my god, what is happening?' But the Earth is just doing crack and relaxing itself. It's all about perception."**

**Practical teaching:** "The next time you feel an earthquake, just relax because the Earth is stretching."

## The Spine of the World

### All Continents Connected by the Spine

Besides all the continents and bones/tectonic plates being connected, **HOW are they connected?**

**Through the SPINE.**

The spine gives flexibility, movement, and stability to all the rest of the bones.

**The human spine is made of 33 vertebrae** (though they unite as we grow, so we have less as adults, but at birth: 33).

**The planet also has a spine** - and it goes through the spine of the world, going through every one of the bones/plates/press of the planet.

**It moves the flexibility of each continent, and you can find it across every chain of BIGGEST MOUNTAINS in the world.**

### The Complete Path of Earth's Spine

**The spine of Earth begins in:**

1. **Transantarctic Mountains** (Antarctica)
2. Goes to **Antarctic Peninsula**
3. Goes down into ocean via **Scotia Plate**
4. Rises up in **Sandwich Islands**
5. Goes to South America at **Tierra del Fuego** (Argentina)
6. Goes up through **Andes Mountains** (entire chain)
7. Arrives Colombia/Venezuela, **opens into two** surrounding Caribbean plateau:
   - One goes through Central America
   - Other goes through Antilles islands until Cuba
8. Get together again in **Mexico City** (in volcanoes)
9. Goes up through **Mexico, United States (West), Canada** 
10. Goes to **Alaska**
11. Crosses **Aleutian Islands**
12. Gets to **Kamchatka in Russia**
13. Divides again:
    - One goes to **Kronotsky Mountains**
    - Goes down through **Japan**
    - Other goes up then both connect at **Baikal in Russia**
14. Opens again to create **Tibet and Altai Mountains**
15. From south creates **Himalayas**
16. Himalayas and Altai together at **Karakoram**
17. Creates **Zagros Mountains in Iran**
18. Arrives **Turkey and Anatolia** - divides in THREE:
    - One up: **Ural Mountains in Russia**
    - One down: Mountains dividing **Western/Eastern Africa** until volcanoes in **Kenya**
    - One center: **Caucasus Mountains, Alps, Mediterranean**, crosses to **Azores**
19. Azores goes up to **Iceland**
20. Iceland goes down to **crossing of the planet at North Pole**

**This entire chain = the spine of the world.**

## Two Perspectives: North Pole vs South Pole

### Humans Look to North (Magnetic North)

We as humans take the **North Pole** as the place on top because we orient ourselves by the magnetic aspect of the world which goes to the north.

**But from the point of view of the universe:**

**"It's the SOUTH from where everything comes."**

### Astrology: South Node and North Node

In astrology charts we have:
- **South Node** = where I come from, what I have within already integrated inside of me
- **North Node** = where I'm heading to, what I'm going to do, what I have to learn in the future

**From the universal point of view:**

**South Node = Unity** (we come from spiritual realms, from origin of universe - that's integrated within us)

**North Node = Manifesting unity through duality** (we're here to create, to manifest, to be creators - we need to work with polarity, divide, create)

### Earth's Perspective

**From Earth's point of view:**

**"The spirit comes from Antarctica because it's the south."**

From there comes the energy of the spirit, and **it's going to the north because it's trying to find creation, trying to live the reality.**

**"That's why we are heading to the north - to manifest, to create."**

**Antarctica (south pole) = the place that reminds us our origins, the axis of our essence.**

## Kundalini from Two Directions

### Human Kundalini: Root to Crown (Matter Seeking Spirit)

**For humans looking for alignment, looking for connection with spirit:**

**"We need Kundalini from the root chakra going up."**

We'd have to start by Africa going to Antarctica to create connection with the divine, with the spirit.

**From the point of view of our matter looking for alignment, we have to go UP activating Kundalini from root chakra.**

### Spirit's Kundalini: Crown to Root (Spirit Manifesting in Matter)

**But from the point of view of the spirit:**

**"The Kundalini is the OPPOSITE."**

**"The spirit is willing to live in this reality, to manifest here."**

**"So that's why from the spiritual world in Antarctica, it goes to the fire of the Third Eye and starts to create this fire towards the opposite - to the matter."**

**The pattern:**
- Matter reaching spiritual → goes UP from root to crown
- Spirit reaching matter → goes DOWN from crown to earth

### Earth Has TWO Crowns

**"Remember the Earth is not like a human. The Earth has TWO CROWNS."**

1. **One crown in the south (Antarctica)** = representing the spiritual crown
2. **One crown in the north (North Pole)** = representing the physical aspect of the crown

## South America: Where Spirit Becomes Fire

### The Scotia Plateau and South American Plateau

If you look at a map:
- **Scotia Plateau** (between Antarctica and South America) = shape of a **penis**
- **South American Plateau** = shape of a **vagina**

**Both together:** The spirit activating the Kundalini from that region of the planet.

**Why the connection between sexuality and spirituality for the planet is exact?**

**"Because this planet is about creation, manifestation."**

**"So that's why the spirituality is related with the root chakra - to create, to manifest."**

### The Ecstasy of Saints

**"You may have heard the perception, the sentence that says 'the ecstasy of saints.'"**

The prophets, the saints, and all the people in the past who were connecting with the spirit - **they felt like if they were having an orgasm, but not a sexual orgasm - a SPIRITUAL orgasm here [third eye].**

**"And that feeling, that sensation is the one that opens the Third Eye and tells you: 'Now I get it. Now I can see.'"**

### Tierra del Fuego: Land of Fire

**The point where this Kundalini of the spiritual realm activates on the planet is Tierra del Fuego.**

**Tierra del Fuego in Spanish means "Land of Fire."**

**"That's where it starts to fire. This is why in South America we connect with the Third Eye - the place where 'now I can see, I can see the fire, I can see.'"**

## South America as Third Eye: Vision and Seeing

### NOT About Countries - About the Continent

**Important clarification:**

**"I am NOT speaking about the states of South America. I am speaking about the tectonic plate of South America. I am speaking about the mountains, the lakes, the nature, the fields, rivers, forests. NOT about Argentina, Chile, Bolivia. We will talk about countries in another moment."**

**The South American GROUND** is what represents the vision in two other dimensions, in two other realities, the one that takes clarity.

**Not the countries.**

### Some Original People Connected to the Land

Sometimes some original people from South America were able to **assimilate the information from the Earth** - so they could tell and explain how that land is talking about the vision of the universe, how to connect from Earth to the vision of the whole cosmos.

**But some of them could, many couldn't.**

### South America is YOUR Vision When You Connect to Earth

**"What I am saying about South America doesn't speak about South American people. It speaks about South America the CONTINENT."**

**"It doesn't matter where you are in the world. It doesn't matter if you have been born in Australia, Asia, Europe, North America - it doesn't matter."**

**"South America is YOUR vision when you connect with the Earth."**

**"When you connect with the planet, your Third Eye IS South America."**

**"So it's not about South American people. It's about a continent that represents a chakra in your body which is Earth."**

## Earth Has No Borders

**"The Earth doesn't have borders. It doesn't have frontiers. It doesn't have nationalities."**

**"The Earth is basically the whole world."**

**"Each one of the parts of the Earth is an organ inside a body."**

**The goal:** **"To remember that we are part of Earth."**

**When we say "I am Earth" and recognize "I am Earth," suddenly:**
- Antarctica becomes my crown chakra
- South America becomes my Third Eye

**It doesn't matter where you are.**

### Earth is Organized in Layers

**"Sometimes when we go deeper into these explanations, you will see: 'But how, how if South America was here, why this I [third eye] is some other place of the planet?'"**

**"Because the Earth is not like a human. The parts of the Earth are all one over the other."**

**"So we are all connected. But we will go into that."**

## South America Represents Vision of the Future

**This is the information of the FUTURE - of where are we heading to.**

**But this information is from the I AM.**

**Because it is a continent close to the spiritual to Antarctica.**

**"So it's about what is coming from my inner self, from the power that I have inside us - the spiritual being."**

**Not about:**
- Politics
- Innovation in the future with technology or whatever
- External future

**"It's about a very much deeper sight."**

## How to Access South American Vision

### 1. Speak with Original People

One way we can bring this information back:

**"By speaking with the original people from South America, who have all this knowledge, but they have it from the PAST."**

So we can have information from them to our knowledge.

**But then we have to transform it into another level, into the new time.**

**"Because we should NOT come back to do exactly the same as before, because that story has passed."**

**"So it's not about coming back to live like them. It's about to take the ESSENCE of that in order to build something NEW in the future."**

### 2. Sacred Plants

**"Of course, many of the holy sacred plants are also helping a lot of people to awake."**

**"So most of them come from South America."**

## Why Matias is in Egypt: Connecting Two Rivers

**Africa = reflection of South America**

**Africa is the first mother of humanity** (the one from the past).

**South America is the one from the future.**

**The River Nile** = bringing all information for a new humanity.

**All this information Matias is receiving in Egypt:**

**"I will try to bring into the new river, the new river of the mother, the new Nile, which is in the Paraná River."**

### Why Matias Was Born in Argentina

**"I myself was born in Argentina because of my own decision."**

**"Because I don't have ANY link in history with South America."**

**"The first time I was born in South America in my existence, I had NO links, NO attachments with that land."**

**"So that's why I decided to be born to do that there - because I don't have any expectations of the past of that land."**

**"I don't have any attachment, anything to solve with that land."**

**"So that's why I'm - I guess I will be able to build towards the FUTURE and not because of the past in that land."**

## The Meditation Alignment: Becoming South America's Vision

### The Journey from Antarctica to South America

The alignment takes us:

1. **Start at Antarctica** - seated on the ice in the white, witnessing the celestial light
2. **Feel the fresh air, the cold** - recognize we're in the throne of the crown
3. **Witness the fire rising in the horizon** - across the sea, in front: a land burning in fire
4. **Jump towards the fire of that land** - see a tiny light shining (a lighthouse in the Tierra)
5. **Fire lights the whole land** - rising between frozen mountains and fjords of Chile
6. **Winds of Argentinian Patagonia** - pushing fire up towards north
7. **The endless rise** - Aconcagua shining wide, salt of the Uni, pearl shining in Lake Titicaca
8. **Snow of Huascarán** - great plains of Argentina and Uruguay
9. **Amazon rainforest** - shadow of life
10. **Volcanoes northward** - bridge in Equator, Holy Trinity of transportation in Venezuela
11. **Lightning through three holy flames** - rising shores of Giants and Suriname
12. **Contemplate South America** - surrounded by light upon light, crashing oceans and skies

**The recognition:**

**"I am the celestial consciousness. I am the celestial consciousness."**

**"For now I am a celestial spirit being aware of what it comes to."**

**"I see. I am South America. I am the Earth and South America is my greatest vision."**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Practice connecting to South America as your third eye:**

1. **Morning Visualization:** Close your eyes, touch your third eye (between eyebrows), and visualize the entire South American continent glowing with magenta light. Say: "I am the vision of Earth. I am South America. I can see."

2. **Fire Rising Practice:** Throughout the day, when you need clarity or vision, imagine fire rising from Tierra del Fuego (bottom of South America) up through the Andes, up through your spine, igniting your third eye with vision

3. **Flexibility Check:** Earth's spine is about flexibility and movement. Ask yourself: "Where am I rigid in my thinking? Where do I need more flexibility?" Practice seeing from multiple perspectives (like Earth rotating 360 degrees).

4. **Evening Reflection:** Write down one NEW vision you had today - something you saw differently, a new perspective, a deeper sight into a situation

### Applying This Teaching

**Connecting to Earth's Third Eye:**
- Spend time learning about South American geography (mountains, rivers, forests) - this builds your vision
- Honor original wisdom from South America, but don't try to replicate past - take essence for future
- Work with sacred plants mindfully if called (many come from South America for vision awakening)
- Remember: South America is YOUR third eye when you say "I am Earth"

**Understanding Kundalini flow both ways:**
- When you're in matter seeking spirit: activate Kundalini UP from root to crown
- When you're in spirit wanting to manifest: activate Kundalini DOWN from crown to earth
- Both movements are valid, necessary, and happening simultaneously
- Don't fear the spiritual "orgasm" of third eye opening - it's natural ecstasy of seeing truth

**Working with Earth as layered body:**
- Release the idea that Earth is organized exactly like human body
- Understand chakras overlap, layer, connect in complex ways
- This teaches you: reality is more complex than simple linear models
- Apply to your own body: you're also more complex than simple chakra charts suggest

## Q&A

### Q: If South America is the third eye, why are South American countries often struggling politically and economically?

**A:** Remember - Matias specifically said he's NOT talking about South American countries or people. He's talking about the LAND, the tectonic plate, the geography. The continent itself (mountains, rivers, forests) holds the frequency of vision and connection to spiritual fire. The human civilizations built on top have their own karma, their own processes. The land's purpose and the people's current state are different things. The land is OFFERING vision - whether people access it depends on many factors. Just like your third eye might be blocked even though you have one.

### Q: How do we access the vision of South America if we don't live there?

**A:** You don't have to physically be there. When you say "I AM Earth," South America becomes YOUR third eye. Access it through:
- Meditation connecting to the Andes, Amazon, Tierra del Fuego
- Study of geography, nature, original wisdom from that continent
- Working with sacred plants from South America (if appropriate for you)
- Visualization of the Kundalini fire rising from Antarctic through South America to your third eye
- Connecting energetically: "South America is my vision" and feeling that truth

### Q: Why does Earth have two crowns instead of one like humans?

**A:** Because Earth is designed for both spiritual connection AND physical manifestation simultaneously:
- **Antarctica (south crown)** = spiritual crown, where spirit comes from, essence, neutrality
- **North Pole (north crown)** = physical crown, where we manifest and create

This reflects that Earth's purpose is to be the meeting place of spirit and matter. We have ONE crown because we're learning to bridge spirit/matter. Earth HAS MASTERED this bridge, so it has both. It's teaching us the complete circuit.

### Q: What's the significance of Tierra del Fuego being called "Land of Fire"?

**A:** Tierra del Fuego is where Antarctica's spiritual Kundalini fire first touches South American land. It's the ignition point where:
- Spirit (from Antarctica) meets matter (South America)
- Cold spiritual fire becomes physical manifestation fire
- The vision begins to activate
- The third eye starts to open

The name "Land of Fire" isn't random - it's the actual energetic function of that place. It's where spiritual seeing ignites into physical seeing.

### Q: How does the Scotia Plateau (penis shape) and South American Plateau (vagina shape) relate to creation?

**A:** This isn't crude symbolism - it's showing how spirit and matter unite to CREATE:
- Spirit (masculine/penetrating/Scotia) comes from Antarctica
- Matter (feminine/receiving/South America) receives spirit
- Their union creates VISION (the offspring of this union)
- For Earth, sexuality and spirituality aren't separate - they're the same creative force

This teaches: your sexuality and spirituality are connected. The same creative force that makes physical life makes spiritual vision. Don't separate them.

### Q: Why did Matias specifically choose to be born in Argentina with no past-life connections there?

**A:** Because to build the FUTURE, you can't be attached to the PAST. If he had karmic links to South America:
- He'd be resolving old patterns instead of creating new ones
- He'd have expectations based on previous experiences
- He'd be pulled to recreate what was instead of building what will be

By having NO past connection, he comes fresh, clean, free to channel new vision for the future. This is brilliant strategy for anchoring new timelines.

### Q: What's the relationship between Egypt (where Matias is) and South America?

**A:** Beautiful mirror:
- **Africa/Nile** = first mother of humanity, ancient wisdom, ROOT of civilization
- **South America/Paraná** = future mother of humanity, new wisdom, VISION for civilization
- **Nile** brought information for old humanity
- **Paraná** will bring information for new humanity

Matias is in Egypt receiving Nile wisdom to bring to Paraná (new Nile). He's connecting ancient mother to future mother. Root chakra to third eye. Past to future.

### Q: How does Earth relaxing (earthquakes) teach us anything?

**A:** It teaches perspective and trust:
- What seems like disaster (earthquake) is often just natural adjustment (stretching)
- The cities panic, but Earth is just releasing tension
- Our human perspective: crisis. Earth's perspective: relief.
- **Application:** When your life "quakes," maybe you're just releasing old tension, adjusting to new energy, stretching into new form

Next time something shakes your world: "Maybe I'm just stretching. Maybe this is my bones/beliefs adjusting." Don't panic. Relax into it.

### Q: Why is flexibility more important than stability in this teaching?

**A:** The spine of the world is about MOVEMENT, not being stuck. Look at the teaching:
- Earth's axis = movement, driving forward, transformation
- Earth's spine = flexibility connecting all bones
- Earth rotates 360° = seeing all perspectives, not fixed view
- Tectonic plates = always moving, creating, destroying, recreating

Stability comes FROM flexibility, not from rigidity. Earth is stable BECAUSE it moves, adjusts, transforms. If it were rigid, it would break. Same for you. Your stability comes from being flexible enough to adjust to new energy, new vision, new truth.

## Final Reflection

Tomorrow is Christmas - the celebration of a birth, a light coming into the world. How fitting that today we learn about South America, the land of fire where spiritual vision ignites into physical manifestation. The Kundalini of spirit flowing down from Antarctica into Tierra del Fuego, rising up the Andes like flames climbing a ladder to heaven.

We often think of vision as something in our heads, something mental. But today's teaching shows us: vision is FIRE. It's the ecstasy of saints, the spiritual orgasm of seeing truth, the burning clarity that comes when spirit and matter unite. South America isn't passive vision - it's active seeing, creative sight, transformative perception.

And here's the profound gift: when you say "I am Earth," this becomes YOUR third eye. You don't have to be born in South America. You don't have to live there. You don't have to recreate indigenous practices. You simply have to REMEMBER: that land is part of your body, and when you connect to it energetically, you connect to the vision it offers.

The Earth is not organized like a human body - it's layered, overlapping, complex. This teaches us to release our need for simple, linear understanding. Reality is more mysterious than our models. Your own body is more mysterious than chakra charts suggest. And that mystery is beautiful, not confusing.

So tonight, on Christmas Eve, as humans celebrate the birth of one light-bearer 2,000 years ago, remember: YOU are the light coming into the world now. Your third eye is opening. The fire from Antarctica is rising through South American Kundalini into your vision centers. You are beginning to SEE.

The spine of the world connects all continents - all parts of yourself. When Earth stretches (earthquake), it's just releasing tension. When you stretch (life quake), you're just releasing old rigidity, becoming more flexible, opening to new vision.

Tomorrow we'll explore the throat chakra, but tonight, sit with this fire. Feel the magenta light of South America glowing in your third eye. Feel the spiritual Kundalini moving through Earth's body - which is YOUR body.

You are Earth. South America is your vision. And the Land of Fire is burning bright within you, showing you what comes next.

I am the celestial consciousness. I can see. I can see. I can see.
