## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

So today we are here again with the guys.

So if you look me , if you watch me staring to someplace or say something , is because they are here to another loan.

So today we , well tomorrow we finish incredibly our month of torus.

So today we have the the production with our niece , sorry with our ankles , feed chara related to the skeleton , to the bone system.

So I would like to begin today , sing something that sometimes , I guess that , I guess that , yes , there 's some people might have been mistaken or understanding something wrong what I said. Or maybe some people has been having this problem throughout the entire 300 days that has passed already , which is the moments when I say examples. When I say an example , when I say imagine or like if it is , when I say this kind of things , I am saying examples.

So this means that is a pedagogical way in which we can understand something or relate to something to get it.

So not all the things that I explained are literal like this. They are just examples for us to relate to that concept.

## Q&A

So yesterday I said , imagine that , like if we are the cells of the muscle part of the planet and some people ask , but you have said before that we were the neurons of the planet.

So that 's what we call an example , that we call an analogy. It 's not a precise data is basically an idea.

So you can relate to. Yeah , so just in case.

So tomorrow is the day 300.

So we have been 300 days doing this. Every alignment and doing a very explanation.

So it 's incredible that we have arrived until this number.

So tomorrow , of course , is Thursday.

So we will be connected with the in the pyramid. We will go here with my friends into the pyramid.

So we will be connected there.

So for you to set intention during this whole day tomorrow that we will change the number to the 300.

So it 's been amazing.

So thank you all of you that has been all this from the very beginning.

So the topic for today is the skeleton.

Okay , so skeleton. Skeleton comes from the word skeleton który nursing an language scale meaning Moira Wood moving , Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. We 're dry. We 're dry.

We 're dry.

So skeleton are cold like this. We 're either dry because of course that when you die the last part that you have of the body that reminds you what you wear or what that person has been is a skeleton. Is the remnants of what we wear once.

So this is why also for many cultures it reminds the past story and reminds us about that that we are not eternal. That we can die and that 's all the things that we will have left.

So because of this we have waited a long time we have created the idea of fear there. And many other cultures took the concept of bones as something that was a way to open to the memory of the ancestors of the spirits.

So this is why we also commonly are a threat of the bones of the skeletons because they also can connect you with the memories of the things of the things in other levels.

So having humans around.

So the thing that I was saying with this is that I 'm going to talk about the skeletons from the point of view of life. How can we start to see from this point of view of not only death but also about the perception of life.

So of course that when we think about the skeletons we commonly think about death about something that reminds us the end of things because we see a dead body so we think about death. What to try?

So when we relate to death we usually do n't think about the importance of life in the skeleton. The importance that it has in our common daily life which would be that the skeleton basically produce most of the things that we have most of the part of our blood that allows us to move to have a flow in our lives.

So without the skeleton we would n't be alive basically.

So it 's important to see that part of the system.

So before everything this tries to remember why do we have a skeleton.

So remember that as we spoke yesterday at the beginning of life. All cells , all biological beings that were the first ones on an existing , they lived in the oceans.

So the environment where they were moving through was liquid was water.

So that 's why they did n't have much effort to do in order to move from one spot to the other because the same environment were pushing it to from places.

So we had to do it differently when the nutrients and the food and light were not in a huge amount. They started to need to move to go farther to look for this nutrients in this space so they had to move.

So they said yes , they started to develop from the cells , these constructions that helped them move that we related with the muscles. But also they created a structure. The creature is a structure that was made of her was cartilage.

## Practice Structure

So they started to build the structure of cartilage so they could a strong structure to hold the organs to move in the space to have this strength in order to move around.

So the cartilage was something that helped the living beings to have a structure of movement also by protection. They started to create , it started to appear animals with this structure so they could be protecting the main organs inside.

So from this living beings of cartilage , they started to divide into groups. One , the invertebrate and the other ones , the invertebrate demons.

So we can try to understand this like that so it could be easier to get.

So we can have basically this idea which is from cartilage they divide in invertebrate which is holding the entire structure within. And the vertebrate that they had a pattern to follow in the structure.

So all the beings in the ocean start to divide into groups.

So we can have from one side all the octopus , muscles and in the other side we have the fishes.

So these two are in the ocean but through thousands of years we have changed in the weather.

So that kills a lot of beings in the oceans which means less food.

So they have to get out of the oceans to find for new resources.

So what they start to do is to become and feed us.

So from the oceans they start to go to the outside but they live in both. But what happened? The gravity in the oceans as everyone knows are works differently because the pressure of the water helps you to float it.

So this is why the gravity is holding you in the oceans and you do n't have to make much strength in order to move around.

So you get out of the ocean the gravity is felt the pressure is much more harder.

So that 's why you need a stronger structure inside so you can move so you can have strength.

So this is why the animals start to take the the they start to take the the minerals from the from the earth as they were eating. And all these minerals got stuck in the cartilage and they became part of what we call bones.

So they evolved into bones.

So we got the hard structure that we could move that we could walk on on the on the surface. When we open up the energy that we could draw while flowering the single państubs for how many some can bring up these things let the fill those that disappeared to meet up in to meet a few things.

So what happened by now in the oceans , but before they lived on earth , they lived on the surface. Most of the animals that we now know as animals that has their territory , they have bones and lived in the oceans , millions of years ago they were living on the surface. Like for example , the whales , now we see the whales , swimming in the oceans , but once they were like hipped , for example , or like an elephant , something like this.

So they were walking around the surface , okay , and then they became like kind of well-rest , well-rest , okay. This kind of animals that live also in the water , and eventually they became the ones that we know today.

So the reason why they did that is because at the first time they went out of the oceans to look for food and eventually some moment we ran out of food on the surface , so they started to look for it in the oceans again.

So of course humans , we also did the same path.

So we once lived in the oceans and then we became mammals living on the surface with bones.

Okay , so as humans , we can , for example , this example , to have an image of this. This is a bone , and usually we think about the bone as something that is dead that we have inside and it 's dry and then when we die it just is the thing that stays. But really bones , the bones are really alive all the time inside our bodies. We just see the dead bones , but they have a much life.

So the bones basically are in the structure , the bones are made of calcium and many minerals that get attached to to make it a strong system that gives strength to the body. But actually inside the bones , what we have is that everything is like a sponge.

So the structure inside is full with tiny things and our theories that move the blood inside of the of the bone all the time constantly. There are sponges that receive blood and give blood. And inside of it is hollow inside of the bones. They are hollow because inside we have the marrow.

The marrow inside which is the liquid that allows that creates the cells that goes to the blood.

So red cells , white cells , mother cells , they are basically created inside the bones.

So all the circulatory system is filled up with all the things that are created inside the bones.

So what is important to realize to know about the bones here is that they are not just the dry part of our body , the just whole structure. And then we die , we see them like they are inside. No , what we see outside as a dead bone is basically just the the shell of minerals of the bone. But actually they are alive.

They are all the time alive within us.

So from this understanding of bones , we can get something important that helps us see how the structure that holds our bodies is the one that gives the flow inside of our bodies.

So this is the philosophical point of view of this system.

So the important thing , the philosophical point of view of this system is that structure structure is the key for flowing. And of course some of you maybe if your prices or cancer would say no , but let 's go into this. If you think about this in this way , you can get that through thousands of years , humans we have been evolving into trying to managing the reality around through the strength that we develop in our body , the structure that we have.

So we discover how to find the axis , how to stay still in our own center by moving with this power , with the structures of the bones. But even besides that , besides that what we have is that the bones are creating the basis of the blood. The bones are the ones creating also through the joints , the movement of the body.

So it 's the same structure that gives the power for the hard to beat for the bodies to move , to do everything that we do.

So this is why throughout our life we need this kind of structures in order to hold the pattern the idea for us to not get lost in what we are going to do. Step by step of what and how are we going to do it.

So we can move freely once we have the structure , the pattern.

So for example in our year of the I. M. We have a lot of structures , the bones of the project. The bone project are that we have 12 , 12 , month of 30 days each divided in three weeks of 10 days.

Each day is a chara , the tenth day of every week. We connect the torus.

So all of us , we can understand and we can know the entire structure. But what we do n't know is what are we going to speak about every day? Not even me. I have no precise idea of what I 'm going to explain , what we are going to go through that day , the explanation , the topic , anything.

So we are moving freely because we have a structure.

So you know what it 's coming next , so you can prepare for the structure , but inside we flow.

So if we would n't have this system around this structure , we would n't be able to understand why are we doing this or how are we going to create this entire pattern?

## Guided Meditation

So the entire path is possible because of the structure. And of course that because of this structure is why we can flow with the topics , we can flow with the meditation , whatever , it 's going to happen in between. The structures gives us security so we can flow better , much more harmonious. When we understand that the structures are something that helps us , we can understand that they work like the joints.

They work like the movement of the body.

So every bone is like a structure itself.

So some people think that their whole life is a structure so they can flow through life. Because they know the planning so you can go through , but there are some people that are scared of what is coming in front.

So they start to feel worried about if they are going to be able to face the new things , if they are going to be able to handle the conflicts in the future.

So they just get attached to the previous structures that they already know.

So they say I prefer to stay with what I know and not to do something new because even if I have a structure I do n't know what it 's coming. I do n't know how it 's going to flow that structure.

So those people get stuck in only one bone. It 's like this bone is the structure for the entire life. Which brings us the conflict that we can not move forward.

So now we 're matching that this R is like two structures connected by a joint.

So imagine that this part of the body , this structure here is this structure here is like the month of May in which we are and the hand is June.

So tomorrow we change from May to June and we have the joint here to make the change. But if some of you get stuck in this part of the arm and they said I do n't want to leave the torus way of seeing things. I 'm not open because I 'm afraid what 's going to happen June.

So you 're not going to have the flexibility in your joint to use your hand and you will try to make this structure to keep going.

So that will make that your joint is so structure that you wo n't be able anymore to move your hand.

So you are not going to be able to do anything with your hands.

So of course that in our life if we leave our life as a whole structure we will break because life tends to be a movement , a constant movement.

So if someone is leaving their entire life through only one structure is like breaking bones.

So that 's a crisis.

So if you pay attention to the bones that you 've breaking your life those are the structures that are breaking in your own pattern.

So you would know exactly what is your life telling you to break , to solve from your life.

So you have to think about every structure , every bone in your life , like one period of stability and then you have a joint that helps you to have a flexibility for the next one and so on. Like an arm. You have one bone , then flexibility , the other bones , flexibility , other bones.

So constantly. But if you have only one arm like this it will be easy to break if it 's only one structure.

So summarizing this topic , this concept , we have to think about the history of the bone system as a way in which we accomplish to have a structure to keep us strong enough so we can do our life but also to allow us to flow in order to create to manifest to do everything in our lives.

So remember that we have to pay attention to our bone system in order to learn how to flow , having a structure and not to attach with a structure so we can break.

So remember that that structure are useful to flow. The problem of structures is to attach yourself very firmly to them. As an advice for you to practice this structure , something simple. For those people that are flowing all the time and does n't have much structure , I would recommend to find maybe in your day or your week or your month or your year.

Some specific moments in which you will have something to repeat , something to do. Like I have to do this every week , I have to do this every day or something like this.

So you can practice that at least one hour of your week.

So practice that and if you are very structured person , just try to find one moment in the week or the day in which you do n't have anything to do but just when you arrive in that moment , try to do anything that you would n't expect to do. Try to do whatever is not in your idea of the day.

So do n't plan anything for that moment.

So just try and think that you can then apply in attitudes , in thoughts , thinking and so on.
