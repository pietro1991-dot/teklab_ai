## Overview

Day 108 brings us to attachment—one of the fundamental causes of suffering in human experience. Every spiritual tradition addresses attachment: Buddhism calls it tanha (craving/clinging), Hinduism speaks of maya (illusion we grasp), Christianity warns against worldly attachments.

But today's teaching approaches attachment from an unusual angle: **through the lens of the 12th dimension and something Matias calls the "interdimensional box" or "rubric cube."**

We work with the third eye chakra—the center of vision, perception, and dimensional awareness. The third eye sees beyond the obvious, beyond the surface level, into deeper patterns and higher dimensions of reality.

Attachment, Matias explains, is what happens when you can only see reality from the 3rd dimension (physical, linear, time-bound). From that perspective, everything is separate, temporary, and losable. Of course you cling—you're afraid of loss.

But when you access 12th dimensional vision (through the third eye), you see that nothing is ever truly lost, nothing is truly separate, nothing is only temporary. Everything exists simultaneously in all dimensions. Attachment becomes unnecessary when you can see the wholeness.

This teaching uses analogies and poetic language because the 12th dimension cannot be fully explained in 3D language. Allow it to work on you intuitively rather than trying to grasp it purely intellectually.

## Core Teaching

### What is Attachment?

At its simplest: **Attachment is clinging to something because you believe losing it would diminish you.**

You attach to:
- People (lovers, children, friends, family)
- Things (possessions, money, home, comfort)
- Ideas (beliefs, identities, being "right")
- Experiences (past memories, future hopes, current circumstances)
- States (youth, health, happiness, success)

The attachment says: "I need this to be okay. Without this, I am less. If I lose this, I lose part of myself."

This creates suffering because **everything in the 3rd dimension is impermanent**. Everything changes, everything eventually dissolves, everything transforms. If your sense of wholeness depends on things remaining as they are, you will suffer.

### The 3rd Dimensional Perspective

In the 3rd dimension—physical reality, linear time, separate objects—attachment makes perfect sense.

From this perspective:
- You are here, separate from everything else
- Things exist or don't exist
- People are alive or dead
- Experiences happen and then are gone
- Time moves forward; the past is lost; the future is uncertain
- Loss is real and final

If this is your only reality, of course you cling. Of course you try to hold onto what you love. Of course you fear change and loss. You're trying to preserve something that feels fragile and temporary in a world where everything ends.

Attachment is a 3rd dimensional survival strategy.

### The 12th Dimensional Perspective

The 12th dimension (in the cosmology Matias teaches) is a level of consciousness where you can perceive all possibilities, all timelines, all versions of reality simultaneously.

From the 12th dimension:
- Nothing is truly separate (all is interconnected)
- Nothing is truly lost (all exists simultaneously across dimensions)
- Nothing is only temporary (all moments exist eternally in their dimensional space)
- Time is not linear (past, present, future are simultaneous)
- Every version of everything exists somewhere

From this perspective, attachment becomes unnecessary—not because you don't love or care, but because **you can see that what you love never actually disappears; it simply shifts dimensional location.**

### The Interdimensional Box (Rubric Cube)

To help us understand this, Matias introduces a visual metaphor: the interdimensional box, which he also calls a "rubric cube" (like a Rubik's Cube).

Imagine a cube with many faces, many sections, many possible configurations. Each face of the cube represents a different dimension of reality. Each section represents a different timeline, a different possibility, a different version of existence.

When you twist the cube (like a Rubik's Cube), the pieces move. A piece that was on one face is now on another face. From the perspective of the original face, that piece has "disappeared." But it hasn't disappeared—it's just on a different face of the cube.

**This is what happens with attachment and loss in our lives:**

- A person you love dies → They haven't ceased to exist; they've moved to a different face of the cube (different dimension)
- A relationship ends → That version of the relationship still exists on its face of the cube (that timeline); you've just moved to a different face
- Your youth is gone → It still exists on its face of the cube (that moment in time/space); you're now on a different face
- You lose a possession → That object exists somewhere in the cube; it's moved to a different section

From the 3rd dimensional perspective (standing on one face of the cube, looking only at that face), these feel like permanent losses. The piece is GONE from this face.

From the 12th dimensional perspective (seeing the whole cube at once, all faces simultaneously), nothing is lost. The piece is simply on a different face. All faces exist simultaneously.

### Seeing with the Third Eye

The third eye chakra is your portal to dimensional vision—the ability to see beyond the 3rd dimension into higher dimensional reality.

When the third eye is closed:
- You only see the 3rd dimension
- You perceive separation, loss, impermanence
- Attachment feels necessary for survival
- You suffer when things change

When the third eye is open:
- You see multiple dimensions simultaneously
- You perceive connection, eternal existence, transformation rather than loss
- Attachment becomes unnecessary (though love remains)
- You can allow change without suffering

**Opening the third eye doesn't mean you stop loving or caring.** It means you love and care without clinging, without fear of loss, without needing things to stay exactly as they are.

### Attachment vs. Love

This is crucial to understand:

**Attachment is fear-based.** It says: "I need this to stay exactly as it is or I will suffer."

**Love is freedom-based.** It says: "I cherish this, and I allow it to be exactly what it is, including its transformation."

Attachment contracts, holds tight, fears loss.

Love expands, allows movement, trusts transformation.

You can deeply love someone without being attached to them. This means:
- You love them for who they are, not for what they give you
- You allow them to change, grow, even leave
- You trust that your connection exists beyond the 3rd dimension
- You don't need to possess or control them to feel secure

This is the difference between attachment (3rd dimensional clinging) and love (12th dimensional trust).

### Why We Attach

Attachment develops because:

**1. 3rd dimensional perspective** - We only see physical reality, so loss feels final and terrifying

**2. Identity confusion** - We confuse what we have/love with who we are, so losing it feels like losing ourselves

**3. Fear of emptiness** - We're afraid if we let go, there will be nothing left; we'll be alone, empty, lost

**4. Lack of trust** - We don't trust that the universe will provide, that we're held, that we're safe beyond what we can physically grasp

**5. Forgetting wholeness** - We've forgotten that we are already complete, already whole, already connected to everything

### The Practice: Seeing with 12th Dimensional Vision

The work is not to force yourself to "not be attached" through will or discipline. That just creates spiritual bypassing and repression.

The work is to **open your third eye to 12th dimensional vision so you can SEE that attachment is unnecessary.**

When you see with higher dimensional awareness:
- You recognize that the person you love exists across all dimensions, not just this physical one
- You understand that your connection exists beyond time and space
- You know that what you're calling "loss" is actually "transformation" or "dimensional shift"
- You trust that everything you need is always available in the infinite cube of possibilities

This seeing naturally releases attachment—not through force, but through understanding.

### Applying the Teaching to Specific Attachments

**Attachment to people:**
- See them as existing across all dimensions
- Your connection is deeper than physical presence
- Even in death or separation, they exist on another face of the cube
- Love them without needing to possess or control them

**Attachment to things:**
- Recognize that objects are temporary expressions of energy
- Appreciate them while they're on your face of the cube
- Release them when they move to another section
- Trust that you always have what you need

**Attachment to experiences/past:**
- The experience still exists in its moment (its face of the cube)
- You can access the wisdom and love from it without needing to repeat it
- The past hasn't disappeared; you've moved to a different present
- Honor it and move forward

**Attachment to ideas/identity:**
- Ideas are tools, not ultimate truth
- Who you are is much larger than any concept
- Allow your identity to evolve as you move through the cube
- Trust your essence remains even as the forms change

### The Rubric Cube Meditation

Matias suggests visualizing the interdimensional box/rubric cube as a meditation tool:

See yourself in the center of a multidimensional cube. Each face represents a different dimension, timeline, possibility. As the cube turns, you move from one face to another. What was "here" is now "there," but nothing is lost—it's all part of the same cube.

Everything you've ever loved still exists somewhere in this cube. Everyone you've lost is on another face. Every experience you've had is preserved in its dimensional location. You haven't lost anything; you've simply moved through the cube.

This vision, accessed through the third eye, transforms attachment into appreciation, clinging into allowing, fear into trust.

## Practice

### 12th Dimensional Vision Meditation (Third Eye)

This practice helps you access higher dimensional perception to see beyond attachment.

**Preparation:**
- Sit comfortably
- Close eyes
- Place hand on third eye (between eyebrows)
- Breathe deeply
- Set intention: "I open to 12th dimensional vision"

**The Practice:**

1. **Identify your attachment** (5 minutes)
   - What are you most attached to right now?
   - Who or what do you fear losing?
   - What do you cling to for security?
   - Don't judge it—just identify it clearly
   - Feel the contraction of attachment in your body
   - Notice where it tightens (heart, gut, throat?)

2. **See from 3rd dimension** (5 minutes)
   - From physical reality perspective, why does this attachment make sense?
   - What would losing this mean to you?
   - How does loss look from 3D perspective? (Final, permanent, diminishing)
   - Let yourself feel the fear of loss fully
   - This is valid—from this perspective, the fear is real

3. **Visualize the interdimensional cube** (8 minutes)
   - Imagine a large, multidimensional cube
   - Each face represents a different dimension, timeline, possibility
   - See the thing you're attached to existing on one face of the cube
   - See yourself on that same face
   - Now see the cube beginning to turn, like a Rubik's Cube
   - Different faces come into view; others move out of view
   - But ALL faces still exist—nothing disappears

4. **See from 12th dimension** (10 minutes)
   - Now zoom out until you can see the WHOLE cube at once
   - All faces simultaneously
   - From this perspective, what you're attached to exists on multiple faces
     - The person exists across all dimensions
     - The experience exists eternally in its moment
     - The object exists in the energy field
   - Nothing is ever truly lost
   - Things just move to different faces of the cube
   - But the cube itself is whole, complete, eternal
   - You are the cube, not just one face of it

5. **Feel the shift** (7 minutes)
   - Notice how attachment feels from 3D perspective: tight, fearful, clinging
   - Notice how it feels from 12D perspective: spacious, trusting, allowing
   - You can still love deeply from 12D
   - But you don't need to cling
   - You trust that what you love exists beyond physical form
   - Breathe into this spaciousness
   - Let the contraction release naturally

6. **Integration** (5 minutes)
   - Return to normal awareness
   - But bring the 12D vision with you
   - When attachment arises in daily life, remember:
     - This is 3D fear
     - Nothing is truly lost
     - Everything exists in the multidimensional cube
     - I can love without clinging
   - Commit to practicing this vision

7. **Closing** (3 minutes)
   - Hand on third eye
   - Thank your higher dimensional sight
   - Open eyes gently

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Attachment Awareness:**

Throughout the day, notice moments of attachment:
- When do you feel fear of losing something?
- When do you cling tightly to a person, idea, or thing?
- When does change feel threatening?

In those moments:
1. Acknowledge: "This is 3D fear—it's valid from this perspective"
2. Shift: "What if this person/thing exists beyond this physical form?"
3. Visualize: See the interdimensional cube; see that nothing is truly lost
4. Allow: Release the clinging without forcing; let it soften naturally

### Weekly Focus

This is day 8 of Scorpio week (extended into the weekend). You've gone deep into emotional territory—resentment, sadness, melancholy, hypocrisy, and now attachment.

All of these emotions and patterns are related to 3rd dimensional perception—the limited view that creates suffering. The third eye teachings (resentment on Day 102, attachment today) are showing you: **when you see with higher dimensional awareness, these patterns transform naturally.**

You don't need to fight attachment. You need to see beyond it.

### Living the Teaching

Practice 12th dimensional vision in daily life:

- When you fear losing someone, remember: they exist across all dimensions; your connection is eternal
- When you mourn the past, remember: that moment still exists in its place in the cube; the wisdom and love are still accessible
- When you resist change, remember: nothing is being destroyed; it's just moving to a different face of the cube
- When you cling to identity, remember: you are the whole cube, not just one section of it

This doesn't mean you don't feel grief or loss—feel everything fully. But you can hold the higher dimensional perspective simultaneously: the form changes, the essence remains.

## Q&A

**Q: How is this different from spiritual bypassing? Doesn't saying "nothing is lost" dismiss real grief?**

A: 12th dimensional vision doesn't negate 3rd dimensional experience—it includes it. When someone dies, the grief is real. The physical loss is real. Honor that fully. AND simultaneously know that the person exists in other dimensions, that your connection transcends physical form. Hold both truths: the grief is valid AND nothing is ultimately lost. This is integration, not bypass.

**Q: If attachment is natural in the 3rd dimension, why work to release it?**

A: Attachment causes suffering. You cling out of fear, then suffer when inevitable change happens. You don't release attachment to be "spiritual"—you release it to reduce your suffering and live with more peace, trust, and freedom. Also, you're not only 3rd dimensional—you have access to higher dimensional awareness through your third eye. Why not use it?

**Q: Can I access the 12th dimension, or is this just a metaphor?**

A: Both. For most people, the 12th dimension is accessed intuitively, in meditation, in altered states, in moments of profound knowing. It's not a physical place you go; it's a level of consciousness you access. The interdimensional cube is a visual metaphor to help your mind grasp something that transcends linear thinking. Use it as a tool, not a literal description.

**Q: What about healthy attachment, like bonding with a child or partner?**

A: There's a difference between bonding (connection, love, commitment) and attachment (fear-based clinging). You can be deeply bonded to your child while not being attached—meaning you love them, care for them, AND you allow them to be their own person, to grow, to change, even to eventually leave. Attachment says, "I need you to be a certain way for me to be okay." Bonding says, "I love you and I trust your path."

**Q: How do I practice this when I'm in acute grief or loss?**

A: In acute grief, you don't practice anything—you feel. You honor the pain. You let yourself break. Later, when there's space, you can gently access 12th dimensional vision to find some peace and perspective. Don't force it. Grief has its own timing. This teaching is for integration, not for the raw early stages of loss.

**Q: If everything exists in all dimensions, does that mean my deceased loved one still exists and I can connect with them?**

A: According to this teaching, yes. They exist in other dimensions/faces of the cube. You may not be able to connect physically (because you're on different faces), but the connection exists beyond the physical. Many people experience this through dreams, meditation, synchronicities, or direct knowing. Your bond transcends physical presence.

**Q: What if I can't visualize the cube or access higher dimensional sight?**

A: Not everyone is visual. You might access it through feeling (sensing multidimensionality), through knowing (direct intuition), or through concept (understanding without needing to see). The third eye isn't only visual—it's perception. However it works for you is correct.

**Q: Does releasing attachment mean I won't be sad when things end?**

A: No. You'll still feel sadness—it's a natural response to change and endings. But the sadness won't be compounded by attachment's fear and clinging. You'll feel the sadness, honor it, and allow it to move through without the added suffering of "this shouldn't be happening" or "I can't survive this." Less attachment doesn't mean less feeling—it means less suffering.

**Q: How does this teaching relate to Day 102's resentment teaching (also third eye)?**

A: Both are about seeing beyond 3D perception. Resentment happens when you unconsciously re-feel old emotions (seeing only linear time). 12D vision shows you that you can access the wisdom of past experiences without being trapped in re-feeling them. Attachment happens when you cling to forms (seeing only physical separation). 12D vision shows you that connections exist beyond form. The third eye, in both cases, liberates you from limited perception.

## Closing Reflection

Day 108 takes you into the mystery of attachment through the lens of higher dimensional consciousness.

Attachment is not a moral failing—it's a natural response to living in the 3rd dimension, where everything appears separate, temporary, and losable. Of course you cling. Of course you fear loss. From that limited perspective, loss is terrifying and final.

But your third eye gives you access to a higher dimensional vision—what Matias calls the 12th dimension—where you can see the wholeness of reality, the eternal nature of existence, the multidimensional cube where all possibilities, all timelines, all versions of everything exist simultaneously.

From this perspective, nothing is ever truly lost. Things don't disappear; they shift to different faces of the interdimensional cube. The person you love who dies hasn't ceased to exist—they've moved to a different dimension. The past you long for hasn't vanished—it exists eternally in its moment. Your connection to what you love transcends physical form.

This doesn't mean you don't feel grief or sadness when forms change. Feel everything fully. But you can hold the higher dimensional knowing simultaneously: **the form changes, the essence remains. Nothing is lost; it transforms.**

This is the difference between attachment (fear-based clinging that causes suffering) and love (freedom-based allowing that honors transformation).

You can love deeply, completely, fully—without attachment. You can cherish what's here without needing it to stay exactly as it is forever. You can honor the past without being trapped in it. You can trust that everything you love exists in the multidimensional cube, accessible beyond physical form.

The third eye is your portal to this vision. Open it. See with 12th dimensional sight. And let the unnecessary suffering of attachment naturally release.

*Day 108: Seeing beyond attachment through higher dimensional vision.*
