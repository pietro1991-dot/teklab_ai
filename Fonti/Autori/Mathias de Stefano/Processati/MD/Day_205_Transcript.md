## Introduction

Hello. Hi everybody. Good morning and afternoon. Good evening.

So , I do n't know if you have been able to read the blog that the post that I did today in the blog. Because I did n't know one hour ago.

So , maybe you had in the time. But anyway , you will do it later for sure. And you will complement it with my chat for today. And the topic is the moon.

So , do you remember that? Do you remember that in the first day we spoke? I explained about the locations of all the planets , the solar system and how the gravity of this planet 's effect has. Much more if they are closer and they are fixed as less if they are far away.

They are much more subtle the connection that we have with them. Much more subtle.

So , well , when I was playing this , now you can understand that the moon. The moon is the seminary , the kind of star that affects us the most because it is the one that is closer to us. It is the closest to our planet. It is only 350,000 kilometers away from Earth , though nothing.

It 's just nothing.

So , it is so close that it is for us even much more important in our life than the sun. The sun is a little bit farther , so the moon is even much more important for us in this planet than the sun. Also , something really important is that we also have been speaking about the importance of the light , in between the stars and in between the satellites and the planets.

So , the reflection of the light and the planets and the shining , the brightness of a star takes a long way to get into our planets.

So , many light years. Well , so the moon , the light that comes from the moon to the Earth , it takes only one second.

So , when the light arrives to the moon and it just reflects in the moon towards us , it takes from the moon to the Earth only one minute to get only one second to come here.

So , that and its light is here. That 's why it 's the closest one.

So , something that for some people maybe is obvious , but for many other people that maybe is not yet. The moon does n't have its own light , like any planet , like any satellite , the moon reflects the light of the sun.

So , the light of the sun goes towards all the planets , satellites and the all these photons , particles of light , then goes to the moon , reflect all the moon and comes to the Earth.

So , when we see , after moon is basically the reflection of the light of the sun.

Something also that , I guess , is good to explain , is that the planets and satellites do n't have their own light. The light that we see from the planets that we also project in other planets is a reflection.

So , is the sun that has the light and we reflect that light.

So , this means that we do n't have our inner brightness.

So , this means that we are just , that the satellites and the planets , we are aspects of the personality that are used that are tools for the beam that is enlightened.

Okay?

So , there are parts of our subconscious , our unconscious , all the different tools that we have to become , our inner wear beam , okay?

Something to understand before we speak about the moon , is the difference between the planet and the satellite. A planet is this , this , air and beam that goes around the sun , okay?

So , a planet has an , either if it is made of gas or if it is made of rocks. It has a magnetic field , so powerful that is able to hold its own gravitational orbit around the sun , around the star , okay?

So , a planet is moving around the star and has its own power of magnetic field. And a satellite does n't have a strong magnetic field , it 's lower , it 's much more poor in magnetism.

So , it does n't have the power to be around a star , but it can be cooled by the gravitational field of a planet.

So , a satellite is cooled by the , by the magnetic field of a planet and spins around this planet , okay? Moving , that is moving around the sun. A planet is moving around the sun and the satellite is moving around the planet.

So , satellite is the way in which we call this rocks around the planet. Important to know that our satellite is , it 's name is Moon , okay? Moon , lunar and Spanish. In the same way as the star is called the Sun , our star is called the Sun , our satellite is called the Moon.

So , of other planets , other planets has also satellites , but they are not called Moon 's. They are called with their names. For example , Mars has two tiny satellites that are called photos and they both.

Okay?

So , this is these are two rocks that are around this planet and they are not called Moon 's , they are called photos and they both.

Okay?

## Q&A

So , Moon is only one and it is in planet Earth. If you ask me , I will tell you this before we start with all explanation of the Moon. The Moon is not artificial. The Moon is not a hologram.

The Moon is real. You can touch it. You can go. You can see that it is there.

It is real. And it has been from the very beginning billions and millions of years ago.

So , it 's natural. It 's there. And the reason why it 's natural and why it 's not a hologram is because the gravity of the Moon is the one that makes us exist. Without the Moon , we are all dead.

And not only that , without the Moon , we would n't have been alive in the first time. We can not exist without the Moon. And now I 'm going to explain why. I know that there are many people saying that the Moon is that the Moon is a hologram or was created to control humans from the space and so on.

But we have to know that from the very beginning in the origin of our humanity , the carvings of describing the Moon and the cycles of the Moon has been always has been there.

So it 's not something from now , it 's not something created in this past time. Also , the movements of the planet , the axis of the planet , the tides of the planet , everything is connected with the Moon.

So the dust , the stones , there are many things of the Moon here on the planet and many things to prove the connection with the Moon in this world. We have to understand that the Moon has been with the Earth from the very beginning. If you take the whole screen here where I find myself now , as a history of the planet , usually the Moon has been most of this space. And we humans has been only here with the size of bacteria here on the last spot of the screen.

So if you take the whole history , it 's so tiny our presence in the planet that thinking that we put a Moon for billions of years just to take care of these few people here. It 's not like that. I 'm sorry , but I would be much more capability now. Let 's try to get out of our ego humans.

We are not so important. We are just an evolutionary option of this planet. That 's it. We are not the center of everything.

So just let 's try to go out from our ego for a moment and it 's not all about us.

Okay , just to relax and we are just an option. It 's not everything about us. Let 's go to the very beginning of how this Moon created.

So let 's go to the origin of our planet. In the very beginning , the Earth was basically like Venus. Venus is like hell , physical hell.

So the Earth was not with the fire , with lava and all of that.

So in the formation of the galaxy , there were so many pieces flying around that they were heating each other and trying to form the planets that we know today.

So there were many pieces that were called planetoids. Planetoids is not a planet , not a satellite. Why? Because it 's like kind of a planet , but it does n't have an orbit , it 's orbit.

So it 's looking for where to say. It does n't know exactly where it belongs yet.

So it 's kind of a planet , but it 's not a planet.

Okay , a plantid. Has the idea of a planet.

So the Moon was like that , was a plantid moving around in the solar system with many others , billions of it. Bigger , smaller , different rocks that were heating the main planets. And when one of them has a core , my medical field , the other ones were heating , the smaller ones were heating and maybe creating crashes and chaos. And then all coming back and creating like a sphere.

Okay , so so this was shaping the planets that we know today.

Okay , so one of these biggest planets was the Moon.

So in the very beginning of the formation of the planet , there was not only one Moon. For sure , there were two , three , four , and more moons around the planet , and most of them were forming the Earth right now.

So for sure , in the first moment , we had much more moons , but satellites , but they were n't , but there was not life here. There is good things to know about this physically , about the Moon. When the Moon was trapped in the Earth , it was because its gravitational field was strong enough to have its own axis spinning around the Earth. But low enough in order to be trapped by the magnetic field of the Earth.

So that 's why we have the Moon.

So , but the Moon is spinning around very fast in the first time. Very fast. And this spinning , also , this spinning makes also that the axis of the Moon is spinning faster. But as much time happens , as farther it goes , as much time happens , the Moon is going away from the planet from the Earth.

So it 's getting farther and farther.

So in the times of the dinosaur , for example , the Moon was closer to the Earth , and now it 's farther.

So in billions of years in the future , the Moon would be really far. Approximately , three centimeters per year , it 's going away.

So it 's , it 's , it 's nothing , but of course , eventually it will go away.

So , so in this movement of the Moon going away , the Moon starts to go lower. Stop to spin so fast around the planet and on its axis.

So it 's slower and slower each time is going away.

So right now , the spinning of the Moon is around 27 and half Earth days , which is exactly the same amount of days that the Moon takes to go all around the planet.

So we spin in 24 hours , the Moon spins in 27 days. And the Moon goes around the planet in 28 days.

So this is why we never see the face , the other face of the Moon. The dark side of the Moon , we do n't see it because it does n't mean that the Moon is not spinning. It 's just that in the same time that the Moon is spinning , we are going with it.

Okay , so that 's why we always see the same face , but in the dinosaur times , the Moon was spinning differently.

So we could see , well , the dinosaurs could see a different face of the Moon. And in this future for sure , in millions of years , some people will be able to see that other side of the Moon. Another important thing about the Moon is that it 's protecting us all the time , because the gravity of the Moon helps to protect us from asteroids and comets. All the big rocks that are going around usually are being pulled by the gravity of the Moon.

So they go outside.

So in the very early moment of the Earth , in the creation of the Earth , it was very important to have a Moon. In order for asteroids and comets not to fall constantly on the Earth.

So the Moon is like kind of taking away all these asteroids and all the craters that you can see in the Moon are many of those that were falling in the Moon during the creation of the planet.

So another important thing about this , that the Moon does for the Earth , protecting it from all the rest of the comets and asteroids , is that it allowed the planet Earth to make its own process inside without being interrupted by asteroids and comets every time.

So it , it helped the Earth to make the , the chemical reactions to create water.

So the water , turn off all the fires , turn off the lava , and it created the oceans.

So the mix with the chemicals of the volcanoes and the waters created life , something that I already spoke in another videos.

So the Moon is the one that allowed life to be possible on Earth and is the satellite that still today allows that. We owe the light the life to the Moon.

So another thing really important on the physical way in which the Moon effect is that the Moon is inside the gravitational , gravitational , field of the planet of Earth.

So the Earth is kind of like holding the Moon like this with a gravity and it spins like dancing all around.

So the Earth and the Moon are touched by the Magnetic of the Moon. And this is why the movement of the Moon is also moving the Earth. The spinning of the Earth is also somehow because of the Moon. And the Magnetic of the Moon is moved also by the power of the Moon.

One of the things that the gravity of the Moon is moving on Earth are the things that are much more subtle in the planet.

So it means the things that the atoms are much more spread. For example , when we speak about minerals , the minerals has all the atoms with so much weight that are attracted to the core of the planet. But the water and the atmosphere are much more wide and spread.

So that 's why the Magnetic of the planet and the gravitational weight of the Moon affect them much more because they are much more subtle.

So this is why the types of the ocean , the movement of the waves , the flow of the water , the low and high pressure of the atmosphere , the storms , the light means are all connected to the movement of the Moon. In such a way , we can relate the Moon like this which or sacred woman that is moving the , how to say , the potterate of life on Earth. During the waters , the electricity that is needed to create and manifest life.

So the Moon is like by its gravity and spinning around the Earth , moving this potterate , creating this alchemy of life.

So if this is like that , every living being that are connected to the mother cells of the ocean from the very beginning , their our bioreathum , which is the cycles of life , our bioreathums are all connected to the Moon.

So by billions of years of life in this planet , our life is bounded and connected to the cycles of the Moon. Our bioreathum is literally the rhythm of the Moon. We humans , we can tell that by rhythm for sure , because the Moon takes 28 days to make a whole turn around the Earth , which is exactly the same amount of days that the women need to make the fertile cycle of menstruation. This is why we relate the Moon with the mother.

So from the very beginning , the Moon is the one moving our cycles of life , the reproduction , to cells , one cell becoming two and expanding and creating life.

So this is why the cycles of the Moon are controlling our sexuality , our reproduction cycle in every animal of the planet.

So in different ways , the sexuality , the process of giving birth will be always related with the night with the Moon. And this is why we call the Moon the great mother. It was the mother of all. This made the Moon much more important than the Sun , because the Sun is always rising the horizon , even if we have this moments of equinocess and solstice.

It 's the cycle of the Moon that was able to tell the humans how to handle the time really , because it 's because of the cycles of the Moon that they could see where when the fruits were growing , when the flowers were blooming. When we can , when the female we are reproductive , when we were much more able to think better , where we can travel better , when is better to hunt.

So many things , so many things that the Moon represented for the daily life of humans , that for them the Sun was always there , but the Moon was telling how to do the things and when to do the things. This is why the humans started to divide the year , starting to divide the year in the process of the Moon , in the month of the Moon , because in this way they were able to explain the life to know how to handle life.

So they had a Moon calendar to know the rhythm of life. As a civilization that leaves its life according to the rhythms of the Moon is a civilization that is able to live in balance , in harmony with its vital energy. Is this why in Greece they call it the Moon Monks , that means the unity , unity of time.

So this is why in the past they started to divide the year in Monks.

So Monks , that means unity of time.

So that 's the origin of the name , month , in English , is the origin of the name. It comes from the word Mona , that is the divisions of the cycles of time according to the Moon.

So that 's 13 months of 28 days each , every cycle of the Moon. That 's why in English we say Moon to the Moon , because Moon is the comes from month and month comes from Monks , that is the unity of time. In Greece they call the Moon Selena. Selena is comes from the word light that is Sells.

And Sells is the light and Selena is the one that writes within Slide , the one that shines. Also with known as the one that shines as white , because the Moon shines like white color.

So that 's why also they would call it Events , Leugnous. Also it was called Events , and Events comes from the Greek word white. And that 's the origin of the word Leugkostits or white cells. The white cells Leukemia , Leg that name is white.

So in Spanish well Latin actually , Leugnous in the Romans could n't say Ka , so they say Lucas , and that 's why we in Spanish have the word Luna for the Moon. Which means white light.

So this is why psychologically we are related , we relate the mother with the Moon. And this is because through thousands of years the mother was designed to be fertile during the cycles of the Moon.

So I have been born , we all have been born because of the fertile period of our mothers. Without the Moon we would n't have that.

So this is why the Moon is related directly with the period of the mother , so our life.

So also remember that we are 70 % water.

So the water is moved by the Moon.

So when the in the same way as the Moon moves the tides , the waves of the planet on its spin and around the world , it also moves our inner waters.

So this is why through blood the Moon is related with our cycles of emotions. How we feel if we feel outdated , if we feel like if we feel that we are mad or crazy or hunger , and we or those kind of things , but also happy. Quiet. Every emotion , everything that we are is related with the cycles of the Moon.

So depending on how we live our lives , if we are balanced or not , the Moon will be affecting us in one way or another. Also , this is why in agriculture they use the cycles of the Moon , because depending on the Moon , you can so you can harvest because you will have abundance , if you do it properly with the Moon , because the plants absorb much more water doing that certain process of the Moon.

So this is why maybe we think that is out there is far away , but even though it is the satellite that affects us the most , because it is really close. And it is pushing us in our process of controlling the food , the cycles of our fertility , our emotions , our cultures , the commerce , everything is controlled by the Moon.

So this is why it is weird to think that the Moon is not there is a hologram or something created , because if the gravity of the Moon would n't be there , we would n't be here speaking right now.

So where we find the conflict that we have today , as humanity , where well a few centuries ago we stopped using the Moon calendar to use only the solar calendar. And the solar calendar is not related with things of life , it is related with transcendental concepts , it is related to things that you can touch that are much more from the inside. I relate with the enlightenment related to the Sun , I relate with the inner concepts that holds the constellations.

So we have these 12 months regarding our inner and transcendental process of the Divine. But that is so far away from our life that we are not imbalance because we leave our time in something that is not real.

So the problem that we have today is that the calendar that we use is not related to our daily life is related with the inner process. This is why it is important to use again a calendar related to the Moon , a lunar calendar.

So we can be really aligned with the process of Earth.

So for the daily days , we use the Moon calendar for the transcendental process we use the solar calendar. I hope that you can understand now the Moon from another perspective. We are so disconnected to the Moon that we do n't even know how to use the calendar of the Moon.

So just pay attention to when the Moon is full. The full Moon is the moment that tells you this is the new beginning. We have the Moon in the Moon. We have the Moon again that when we do not see the Moon and we have the Moon again , we have the Moon again , when we see it completely , the Moon only has two important processes.

In the Moon again , we are thinking about the Moon in the Moon.

So we have a Moon which is when the Moon is not there.

So black and we have the full Moon which is when you see the whole face of the Moon.

So in the new Moon is when we start things in the full Moon is when we close things.

So this Saturday , February 27 is the full Moon in the year ago.

So it means the closure of a process that again in the new Moon of the year ago six months ago.

So this full Moon is the one that tells us you have to make a review of all the things that you accomplish to order in this past six months.

So which I expect for you to be many things that we 're putting order because we are working for this all the time.

So in this past six months.

So I think that with this , this was a summary of the Moon.

## Daily Practice Elements

So I recommend you to start to leave your daily life through the Moon calendar. The vibration for today is dear related to the solar plexus. The statement for today is I am the balance of the Moon. The code for today is future.

In the beginning of the universe everything was an intention. This means that before the first particle or wave existed , everything in the universe was marked intention , potentially. Which in terms of time it 's translated as future. The future is high vibration.

This means everything that moves so fast that ca n't be reached or perceived or seen. It 's out of our perception and dispersed in so many directions that ca n't be categorized. The future is not only one. It 's all the possible ones happening in an instant.

Let 's go to the liners. See the comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. I become aware of each part of my body , caracinous , stretches and young. The take it in breath , the science start to be aware of the body I find myself in.

Of the room I am now. The house , the village or city. The country , the continent and the planet. We take a deep breath , becoming fully aware that I am this body.

I take a deep breath , becoming the room. And take a deep breath , becoming the house where I find myself. And take a deep breath , becoming the town , the city where I find myself. And take a deep breath , becoming the country.

I take a deep breath , becoming the continent. I am the earth. And in front of me , I see the light of the sun. I am feeling the heat on my body.

I can feel the moon spinning around me. I perceive Mars Venus , an airfield close to me. A bit far , Jupiter and Saturn , and in the horizon. Your arms , Neptune and Jupiter.

And take a deep breath and they recognize that I am the solar system. And I concentrate on the moon spinning around me. As the moon spins around me , I can see all its faces. From the full moon till the moon , all of them.

As I see the moon spinning around my body , I feel the gravity of its pushing my body. To spin , following the circle , being pulled by its gravity from the solar patches. As I spin with the moon , I can perceive how it moves my inner water , my emotions , the rhythm of my life. I recognize the force of the moon moves my life from the very moment of my conception to the moment of my death.

It rules all the way up. All the way up. My being exists with the House of the Moon. From this movement , from my places , I can feel that from my mom , from every human , from every animal , plant , and even bacteria.

We are all connected as one under the light of the moon. We are one in its light. And I will show you the same moves myself in circles with the forces of the moon. I connect myself to every living being on the planet Earth.

And I recognize that if I am willing to live in balance with coherence of myself , in the access of my being , I need to learn to live , according to the rhythm of the moon. And take a deep breath and activate the balance of my being. And take a deep breath and activate the balance of my being. I am the balance of the being.

I am the balance of the being. I am the moon. I know that I am. And my first intention of activating the wisdom in me.

I am the wisdom. I begin to get a breath from the places. I start to bring these consciousness all over my body. Stretching , racing , and youngening.

And each one , and sometimes come back here and now. Thank you everybody for being here , always , and see you tomorrow at the same time.
