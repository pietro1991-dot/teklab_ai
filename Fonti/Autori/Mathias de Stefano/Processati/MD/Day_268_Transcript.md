## Introduction

Hi everyone , I 'm morning , good afternoon , good evening. As you can see , I 'm in the process of I need my space being locked and not willing to see anybody. Thank you for to those who gave me this t-shirt last time. I 'm still painting and there are a lot of stuff.

Sorry , I have a phone that I do n't know how to use and I do n't know how to turn it off.

So I was just saying that I am in this type of steel in my inner world painting.

So a bit everywhere. Let 's go to topic for today. The topic for today is Paris.

So the word Paris comes from the Latin period that comes from two words , one pair meaning towards an end and the other one meaning to go.

So Paris comes from the period meaning towards an end and the last one to go.

So to go towards an end.

So Paris is a word that usually we do n't use much in the daily days. We can use much this word because we usually die or to say to get rotten. Yeah , to get rotten.

Something like fruit or whatever. I do n't know if in English you use the concept of Paris food or not Paris food. I never said it in English. Paris symbols.

You say thank you. Parisiable foods.

So in Spanish we use it most for that. But usually usually is a word used in literature , in poetry which is more classic to explain death.

So the idea of Paris is not exactly like to die or something that is dying is a concept that kind of explains the idea of something that moving towards an end.

So it 's not speaking about the action of dying is basically something that is heading to a situation of ending.

So it 's not the same as die or end.

So this is why I think that is important about this topic making a difference with death.

## Q&A

So the reason why we are going to speak about this is because of some questions that emerged from yesterday which is related to the creation. We spoke about the being that is creating , that the mind that is growing up through expanding and creating things in the universe. But suddenly we can find a question of , why this mind is willing to create and manifest and play would allow the destruction of this in the universe. Why it would allow wars conflicts destroying in the universe.

So this is why we are going to try to understand what it means for the universe to destroy and to perish. I would love to do like synaptic organization because I love to do this in school.

So it 's funny that sometimes I hear the interdimensional wars and so on and what I am really concerned about is to make it beautiful synaptic frame.

So this is the frame and then you have the summary so I can explain it later if you want to write down.

So let 's go to this summary of the universe. First of all remember everything begins because one unity decides to expand to come back to itself. Unit there 's so this unity here takes two different paths one side one side which is D D meaning two.

So a diverse diverse is the origin for two paths that goes out to come back within. Those two paths are called negative and positive.

So this positive and negative they will start to create everything dividing by two different paths that we call constants because they happen all the time constantly because of this this two constants will be called time and space. These two constants then are like lines that are always there that lead one to another. They positive and negative.

So the line of time and the line of space they find together in the center positive and negative and they create this air will be the movement of positive and negative making the two lines crossing creating wave. The waves are the ones that will unify time and space in positive and negative in English on that is wave.

So here we have the wave that connects time and space.

So once that we have this time and space and they start to connect to one another multiplying they start to be divided because diversity they diverse the diversity the lines of space they start to multiply by themselves.

So that creates many lines of time , many lines of space , realities and they start to cross one another creating different waves , different vibrations in different waves.

So when they start to cross one another they create these tiny dots where all the vibrations get together creating energy.

So the the crosses of line and space creates a network and this network which is many waves connecting one another what they do is to create nodes and those nodes are the waves so identified by energy that become a particle.

So time and space bending once and again once and again they make a wave into a particle.

So we can have here lines of space and lines of time.

So here in between time and space we have waves that they pass creating nodes and the nodes are basically the crosses of the waves.

So the particles are more because of the wave they are the same in a different organization. For example on different organizations they be macros.

So this network what happened is that it starts to create itself through fractalization fractal. The particles create the fractal with the waves because as you hear the patterns of time and space with the particles they create one start that will repeat itself again and repeats itself again going out and inside be and small.

So that 's the fractalization.

So what happened with this structure that makes order it organized the reality and makes rest the mind because it 's in order is organized. It 's a perfect pattern all organized.

So this means that the universe to all this process discovers the cosmos.

So let 's try to see if I can really draw it here.

So imagine that this network is something that keeps going , keeps going , expanding in every direction.

So they 're common that the lines of time and space they start to curve themselves because they want to come back to the origin , to the center. Can you see it? Can you see the shape that I 'm trying to do? It 's like if all the things from the origin starts to curve themselves coming back to the center.

So what happened here that in each here appears a new origin.

So from it starts to emerge new lines of time and space. This is what we call multi-dimensional , multi-dimensionality. Because remember this is a fractal.

So in each note emerges new networks.

So what happened here is that eventually when these two different lines get over one to another , what happens here is a superposition of lines.

So what happens here is that a line of space is super post over another line of space. A line of time over another line of time.

So they start to create a superposition of things that they should n't be one over the other.

So what happened here that if this is time and this is time and they cross together , the normal path of it would be to to this to keep going like this in the expansion to follow the path. But because time and time are negative and negative , they repel one to another.

So we have time and space is like positive and negative.

So the magnetism they attach because positive and negative they attract like a magnet. But we get time and time or space in space , you have positive and positive or negative and negative.

So what happened is that they repel each other. Like a magnet. And what happens from that is that it turns it makes a motion to itself. It torches itself in order to not to follow the same path.

So it does n't find the same text. It tries to create a new path.

So it torches itself that we call something that we are calling this torsion , this torsion.

So why this is happening in the comfort utilization of the universe? It is so much expansion that eventually they start to come back to themselves expanding and going and and collins to one another. The image that we can have for example is like if you , my hand is going out of the body and it expands so much throughout the entire universe that it starts to bend itself because everything is following the pattern of life of light , which is fire of.

So it moves and turns back again.

So it turns back and comes back and eventually my fingers will go to my nose because of the expansion of the fertilization. Imagine so so many so many hands going everywhere that eventually they wo n't have a space.

So they were start to heat back to the structures from where it came from. And that 's why for example , that comes to the nose and I have a problem , my hand going to the nose , the nose , not willing to let the hand go inside.

So they start to have pain and hurt and so on.

Okay so that would be the image that we have with this.

So a human example can maybe be like humans reproduce in so much in the world that as much humans we have much conflicts will get. And this will be like for some of when there were less humans in the world we did n't have as much as conflict as we do too. Because when we started to reproduce and have more and more and more , eventually we did n't face.

So that 's why they started to pressure one another. And when they found in the same territory they heat and they start to fight because of that territory. This is how we get how humans start before we did n't have countries we just have regions.

So these regions start to have much population so they had to grow and this growing of population made to create a country. And the countries suddenly they found in the opposite side and they start to fight for the limitations. They created boundaries.

So these boundaries were to protect what they have in one side but the other ones wants to also expand.

So as much population they start to have war for the territory and so on.

So this is like the practicalism something it creates. It creates this conflict.

So of course that we can say that this concept of wars and to fight for the territory could be could be silly from the human point of view but this is not something that is human. This is everywhere. This is a fractal of the universe for example the grass. When we look at the grass we may say oh it 's so beautiful.

This mets and this beautiful garden but what actually is happening there is a war. The grass is fighting a war territory. We see grass everywhere because they kill everything that can grow.

So they all the other ones expanding as a fractalization in order to take control of the territory.

So when we see something that is beauty and green what really is getting is the grass fighting a war. And this is happening because not because we have a lot of space. It 's because the space is one space is bending constantly and that 's eternity. It 's constantly bending once again once again.

It 's like if you have this room and everything inside this room starts to hit self by two. Once again once again eventually the whole space will be filled and nothing could fit this space but because space is eternal it can constantly divide once again once again.

So as you see here this is perfect organization this is cosmos and here you can see is a mess because it 's open it 's not a closed system. It 's open and it starts to open once again once again and by this opening constant opening we get chaos. Chaos comes from the in the European language gear that means to yarn. Warning why because warning is to open very much something the map.

Okay so this is chaos so it 's like taking this and cutting so the network is open. If everything would be in perfect order like this nothing would exist. Because perfect order means that nothing really is divided. There is no origin.

So this is a network that is constantly the same. You get cosmos you get order but it 's always the same. In order to exist for us to exist or human to exist a person to exist the camera to exist the air to exist. It for this to break we need chaos in order to exist.

So now here we can understand this. Without chaos we would n't be able to exist because remember existing means to go out from somewhere and the only way you can exist is if you get out from this pattern to create your own. Going away from this pattern. This is why distortion chaos is the thing that help us to exist.

Chaos is the thing that took us to diversity.

So everything in the universe is destined to go from cosmos to chaos. Because this is the only way to set ourselves free from patterns.

So here we have this thing that patterns are order. Because order is basically that you feel comfortable with something that repeats once and again.

So nobody wants to change the patterns. Because it makes people feel comfortable. But when you want to change you need to break the pattern to create something new to change your life. And for sure it happened to you that when you wanted to change the patterns of your life you brought your life into chaos and you 're a time of chaos in your life.

Did you? Chaos is a synonym of evolution. Cosmos is a synonym of stability. Cosmos order can also be horrible.

For example the people that get in relationships that their partners hit them , kick them , do bad stuff to them. And they repeated once again once again why? Because the brain interpreted that that 's the way be. It 's a pattern they have to follow.

So this is why if I want to change that pattern I have to break with this pattern. Understand the first why this pattern came from. And from there I changed it from a different point of view. I switched it.

Bringing chaos in my life of course because it 's friend from before. But that break me to evolution. Everything in the universe goes through this process.

So everything in the reality goes through this process. And we call this process. Life and death. Life and death.

So what do we have in between? We have the path from life to death , from cosmos to chaos. And that 's called to perish. That 's why in the past these two tell us , welcome to life the path towards death.

Because we could understand in that time that going to death , chaos is nothing else but a way in which the body , the reality , distorted itself , to evolution. Nothing really dies in the universe. What really happens is that it evolves.

So to perish is a path of evolution. But we see that as a defeat. We are so much attached to the idea of the patterns of the cosmos , of life and existence that we are a threat of change in chaos and evolution. We think that death is like the ones that defeat life.

When reality death is the one that gives meaning to life. This is a constant , a constant of transformation. This is why death takes us to another way of organization. It transforms ourselves in a different pattern what we call to rebirth , rain , creation.

So to recognize that we live our lives , perish that we are heading to chaos today. It helps us to set ourselves free from the shapes , from the forms , acknowledging that all what we do is in order to transform ourselves in something new , something deep. And what is this all about to keep trespassing data , information , energy. Constantly , one sun again.

Evolving into different ways , better ways in which we can exchange that information.

So this makes to us to acknowledge what is to perish. Helps us to keep going , acknowledging that all the things that we love , all the things that we believe and we want for them to exist are not forever. But we must embrace the idea that they will transform themselves.

So we can not get stuck in one of them because they will be transformed. And if that transformation is not done by ourselves , the universe will get in charge of doing it.

So the task for today is to think about what is the thing that we can not get rid of or the thing that we know , sorry , the thing that we do n't want to get rid of. The thing that we want to to leave behind and find a place to do kind of a ceremony where you just or paint or do or write something that you want to change and you just break it and disarm it and leave it away. In this chapter.

So , so , some people where someone was asking about death.

So you can check about death in November. I spoke about that in November.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the task for today for example , I do n't know , each one can find it some way that imagine , I do n't know , like drawing something that you love the most and you really like and you do n't want to get rid of this and put fire in it , set fire , burn it and to ashes. That 's it. Let 's go to the information for the vibration for today is whole. The statement for today is I am the designer of task.

I have become aware of the space that surrounds me. The body I inhabit in my own breathance. Oh! I hope you serve.

The divine spark under my feet , the light of my body , and I ignite it. I ascend the divine spark to my feet. They recognize my feet as two sacred legs that give birth to two rivers , one white and the other blue. And give its energy.

## Guided Meditation

They set in tension. Yet all the things that does n't allow my path to go on to perish. They breathe and ignite my feet. And I ascend the divine spark to my knees.

I connect both rivers , feminine and masculine in the center of my history. And I ascend the tainted and let perish all those things that does n't allow me to fall from my history. I breathe and ignite my knees. I ascend the divine spark to my root chara.

I recognize me the energy of the vital force , the lake of the Kundalini. And I ascend the tainted and let perish all those things. My desires , my needs , that 's an allowing me to keep going on in my life. I breathe and ignite my chin and toss.

I ascend this divine spark to my sacra chara. I recognize within it the temple of the mother of creation , the signing and life between darkness and light. And I ascend in tension to let perish all those things that I created and that 's keep me attached to this world. I breathe and ignite the sacra.

I ascend the divine spark to the solar floors. And I recognize in it the temple of the body where I find the attributes of my being. I ascend in tension to let perish all those things for myself that I do n't need anymore. I breathe and ignite my floors.

I ascend this divine spark to my heart. I recognize in it the temple of life and love , even as the ageing to the world. And I ascend in tension to let perish all those emotions and feelings that I do need anymore. Here and now.

I breathe and ignite my heart. I ascend this divine spark to my throat chara. I recognize in it the temple of the sun , here are the achievements light. It 's race of light with truth to the entire world.

And I ascend in tension to let perish all of my life. I breathe and ignite my throat. I ascend this divine spark to my third eye. And I air in the front of me the eyes of the things contemplating me.

And I ascend in tension to let perish all the ideas that I had for myself and the world. I breathe and ignite my third eye. I ascend this divine spark to my count. And there the inner eye opens itself in a crown.

The delta. The delta like a lot is surrounded with pyramids as a crown. And I ascend in tension to let perish may be least about all things. I breathe and ignite my crown.

I recognize that this inner the shadow path helps me to set my soul free from all the things that I do n't need anymore.

So I can move forward.

So from now on I can design my own path. I am the designer of my path. I am the designer of my path. I am I am I am I am the designer of my path.

And I start to bring this consciousness taking into breath , dodging and stretching all the body. And each one at a time come back here and now. Thank you everybody for being here another day and see you tomorrow.
