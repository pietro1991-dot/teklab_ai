## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you. You hear me?

So welcome all of you.

Today , I 'm going to talk about the first day of the day of the month of the day. I hope you read the blog because that explains too much , but I would try to make a summary of what I wrote today. Just do n't worry because there was a lot of information. It was two intense and I will try to make some videos explaining it specifically.

Each one of the topics discussed in that post.

So first of all , I would like to clarify that the post that I write every day , I have no idea what I 'm writing. I just sit and start to write and the information just expands and starts to appear.

So , , so , , and the things that I wrote today for me was also like , oh , now I get it , now I get it because I was supposed to write about sadness today. I thought it would be sadness , but I had no idea when I started to write the direction took a very different way and , , and suddenly I knew what it 's like , who , I know I get so many things. , it was , even for me , at discovery of many things and also to understand what happened yesterday , after the alignment that I had no clue of what was happening yesterday.

So now I 'm going to trust , plain.

So , , yesterday for those who had no idea about what happened yesterday , you can see it in the video from November 14.

So during the alignment , I started to feel this being there was really like dark , but also like , light clear , it was weird , but he was really heavy and very inactive , like moving constantly all around like it hit , , plain and , and suddenly I , I , I , I , he was he wanted to talk. But I , I did n't allow him to , , to go inside of me because he was very crazy , so I did n't want him to just turn my energy.

So , I said , , okay , , tell me what you want to say and I will translate it. And , and he said , and he said , no , and I said , who are you? And , and he said , I 'm Pablo , and I said , , that 's , that 's not your name. And he said , okay , I am Pedro , Pedro , and he said , , okay , I will just call you entity and that 's it because I do n't know , I , you 're , you 're playing with me.

So I 'm not gon na name you.

So , , so I will just say you are entity.

So he said , so the message he , he gave was , the things like us , he said , the things like us are here in this existence to try to take us away from the center.

So to prove if we are in the center or not , so they are here to try to take us away from the , from the center. , so because they know how to do it , he wanted to share an information and advice with all of us of how to find the center. And he said , the way you do it , if the law of 12 , the law of 12.

So that 's why I 'm going to explain the law of 12.

So when I start to write and explain to myself today what happened to me in the alignment , , suddenly I started to realize about the information of all the , , the data from the last week that I have in channeling. Since early , I do n't pay attention to the , to the channelings so much because they never have a meaning in the very moment.

So you have to wait until something happens that clarifies everything.

So I do n't , I do n't try , I do n't usually think much when there is a channeling. I just do n't think about it and later it takes all the meaning. And that 's what happened.

So the thing is that suddenly when , when , when he , when the higher self started to explain to me , what was this being that came to me yesterday , he said , he was playing , he was having fun.

So he 's reminded you of all those beings that they , all those things that they play with reality that they are like kids that they represent the , the , the game all the lower , the lower , ways of living like sexuality like the games , all this lower thing lower vibrations playing like a kid. And , , doing jokes and so on.

So he said , what are those beings that usually , we know that that are with that energy.

So he said , the , the founders , the elf. And what is the word for elf? And I was looking into that and he said , pan , pan is the name of the god in of the god , the semi god in Greek mythology. And the man is the name of the phoenix.

They are , , this , this beings represents fertility. They take care of the , of the kids. They , they are playing all the time.

So they represent all the lower passions of the , of the world.

So it 's the pan. That 's the name and he , and he said , and what was his name? And he said , he said Pablo Pedro. And I said , so what is the English name for Pedro in English is Peter.

So it was like Peter pan. No , it 's to , that 's to weird. He said , no , Peter pan , that 's a joke. And he said , well , is not the character from the movie or the book.

It 's not that character. What , what , he represents is the pan. The pan is that being the being that place with reality.

Okay. And , , is the kid that plays with reality.

So , , so Peter pan , the character from the , from the , from the , from the movie from the book. That story is , is , is a character with the energy of the pan of the phoenix and elves from the metallurgy.

So that 's , that 's why they call it like this.

So he was playing , but trying to explain me from where it was. That was , he was trying to say , playing with me.

So , , what my herself explaining is that all of us have this part of the phoenix. The phoenix in the metallurgy represents the lower passions. And the salvage , , energy that we all have within , which is the animal energy that we have inside.

So the phoenix energy is like the kid without the thinking and the morality of the grown-ups , , no wisdom , no reason , just feeling. If the phoenix , the kid is excited is okay. Express this excitement. If the kid , the phoenix is sad or is mad or whatever , it does n't hide anything.

It is what it is. It shows everything.

So that energy we all have within.

Okay. That 's the , , the lower part that says , if I feel this , I have to show what I feel. That 's it. Nothing else.

So this is why it 's so difficult for us the energy of the phoenix because it 's more related to the kids that feels and act according to what they are feeling at any moment. They do n't. Rationale , they do n't think about the consequences of what they are doing.

So the energy of the phoenix is , , it does n't have control. It 's impossible to have control over that because it 's a passion. It never thinks about what is going on. It just feels it just do it.

That 's it. This would mean that if the phoenix , the energy of the phoenix like the kid , it represents the lower passions. And lower passions are not only about sexuality.

Okay. Lower passions are all those actions , those energies that we have , , that we can not control it.

So the passions never think about the consequences of what they do. They just do it. They just play with it. They just do whatever.

Okay. And it does n't matter what happens after that. When you grow up , the adults start to think about the consequences of what you feel what you react.

So you start to control , okay. You start to control the lower passions.

So as older you get the much limitations and control you get.

So basically the , , this , the control over the lower passions is the thing that separate humans from animals and also the kids that have no idea yet about the consequences of their actions. If we have this idea that the adults control the lower passions of the kid. Lower passions.

So you feel safe by the control of your mind. But what happened if the person , if an adult , lose the control. If a person loses control. This means that it comes back to the house of the founders.

So the kid.

So when you lost the control , you go back to the founders home and Greek. The owner is Pan and home is O'ikos.

So pan O'ikos is the house of the founder , which is for us the word panic. What means panic is to lose the control. To lose the control of your own emotions of your own low emotions and have no idea how to control it.

So another important thing to understand is that. It 's not only related with fear. Panic is related to lose the control.

Okay , that 's it.

So fear is one of those emotions over which you lose the control.

Okay , but fear is one of the most important ones because fear was the key for revolution.

So is the main one. Fear is the main one that holds all the the information of what you are now. And I 'm going to explain why this.

Another thing that I want to clarify because maybe this creates some mistakes is about the word panic. Greek also pan means everything.

So we 're not talking about that pan because for example pan the num is the origin of pan demi. And pan demi comes from the word all the demons or all the bad things.

Okay , that 's what it means pan de pandemic and also pan jia all the lands. Pan sexual all the sexes.

So that would be a different thing.

So the importance of fear talking about the panic.

Okay , panic is fear to lose control.

Okay , so so fear. Basically it 's the most important emotion that we have because it helps us to survive and to be what we are today. The very first cell that existed in the ocean survived because of fear because it was a threat of anything that could happen around. And it was looking for different ways to survive and we used that even today.

We have fear to things because we want to survive.

So fear is not something bad. We have to also clean this idea this preconcept of fear because fear is not something bad. Fear is something useful for our revolution if we are trying to survive in this world.

So it 's important. What happened that fear starts to be useless when we are trying to transform ourselves because fear says , hey , you have to be protected.

So if there is nothing to say care off.

So do n't do it , do n't do anything.

Okay , you have to preserve yourself. And that 's the moment when fear is something negative for your growth as a self. But fear is something negative for the growth as a self as a being , but it 's useful for your species. It 's useful for your body.

The reason why fear is something that does n't allow us to move forward is because fear was designed to put all its strength in order to help us survive under circumstances that ca n't kill us.

Some situations , some enemies that ca n't kill us.

So that 's when the fear is activated and protect ourselves so we could survive before as a species. But what happened with the moment that myself with my mind say , I want to change myself. I want to move forward.

So fear is the one saying , but why? There 's no danger around. Why do you want to change? I do n't understand.

We are fine now.

So just keep here. That 's why fear is not helpful when you are trying to awaken from yourself.

So now pay attention to this. All the fears in the history are the ones that put pressure me to locate myself in the place where I find myself now. I mean what I am now.

Okay? We are here.

So the fears are the one that molded where we are now.

So if fear was the emotion helping to evolve , to become when we are and to be where we are , this means that our body is basically made up with fears. Basically , our body is designed by the lower passions.

So what our consciousness is trying to do is to contain this lower passions. The consciousness is trying to give a purpose to those lower passions. And those 12 lower passions are divided in 12 systems.

Remember , in our biology , is the are. The nervous and the brain. Circulatory , digestive , excritory , reproductive , reproductive , respiratory , muscular , bone , immune , emphatic , and inter-gumentary.

So what this means that our body is built by 12 systems that were created through the lower emotions. This is why our body is built inside the house of the phones.

So panic.

So this means that if this consciousness lost the purpose , so one of those 12 systems will get into panic.

So basically , we lost the control.

So the goal that we have according to the message he gave , is that what we have to do is to , if we want to change to transform our reality , the first thing that we have to do is recognize the law of 12. This means that everything in the universe is based on law of 12. Everything is 12. The whole universe is created by patterns of 12 attributes.

Not only us , everything.

So these 12 attributes in our body in biology is distributed in 12 systems , biological systems , that were created through fears.

So what we have to do , as according to what he said , what he suggests , is to find the fears in our 12 systems. And by that , I put consciousness , given the purpose to each one of this systems. And that 's how I will find my center. Let 's go to an example to understand how this works.

Imagine we will take the example of the inventory , which is the skin. The organ of the skin is the system , the inventory system.

So this means that , for example , for some people , to touch the skin to do this , it 's like the best feeling of it. But for some people to touch the skin , it 's like terrible. Like horrible. It 's like if you are cutting the skin , so they do n't touch me , do n't touch me.

So in this system , this means that your inventory system has memory of fear , because maybe you were abused by being hit by your parents or sexually abused.

So you relate the touch with something wrong , with something that hurts. That 's what it would be.

So also what this Peter Pan said is that this emotion is related with someone in the life.

So we have 12 people in the planet that are related to the emotional memory of my 12 systems.

So when I , for example , I touched my skin , somehow my mind will bring me a specific person all the time.

So when you think about person all the time when you have this feeling , so that 's the person that you , in your emotion relate without fear or trauma. That would be an example of one of the systems.

So what he said is that we have nine months until all those next year in 2021. To do this job , to align all that information , to be aware of that information. Because in that moment , we will have to work all together to align ourselves to the law of 12. All the rest of the information is too much and I do n't want to explain it now.

I would do a video separate video during this week , maybe during the afternoon for me.

So I do n't have the time so I can talk whatever. And I will let you know when I 'm going to do it. Plain all the rest of the information because it 's too much and it 's not related to the topic for today.

So I want to just talk about panic today.

So you already know what this being wanted to say yesterday.

So the law of 12 that Peter Pan , it 's funny to say that Peter Pan said yesterday , is that if we find the center. What we are going to do , if we work with it 12 that we have inside in our 12 systems. We will be able to calibrated the 12 parts of our NA , the 12 people around the 12 cultures , the 12 persons , the 12 regions of the planet , the 12 portions of the world , the 12 constellations.

So everything that is 12 will be aligned like the parts of a clock , like everything aligned.

So this is something that he said yesterday that those beings , the the photos , they are beings that are showing us our weakness in the lower emotions , lower the science.

So they are trying to to mess with us so we are not in the access in the balance to prove if we are aligned or not.

So basically these beings are the lower emotions.

So what we try to do is to align that so we do n't get into panic because people usually when we start to think what is coming on. What is what is going to happen , how I 'm going to be prepared , we enter in panic because we think that we are losing control because we do n't have all the clues. And as an advisor will tell you the only way you can set yourself free from panic is to realize that you never had control. The way you get rid of panic is by allowing yourself to lose control.

This is why he said that last work he said was , get fun and enjoy. Because the biggest problem that we create is precisely to try to control something that we should n't control because these emotions are like a river that needs to move forward. The only reason why we usually control all the lower passions is because through thousands or centuries we have been said that this , the lower passions are seen. Do you remember that word?

They are a sin that must be control. We can not control a river that without doubt will go to the sea.

So just picture this. The mind is trying to control the lower emotions and the lower emotions are trying to go up. And why they go up because this lower emotions are the fuel to go up as the Kundalini rising and flowing. If you do n't allow the Kundalini to move , you will never reach the spirit.

So the mind is trying to control something that needs to go up. What we have to try to learn is how for this energy not to do this but to do this movement going up. It 's not about control to eliminate the panic because panic basically is when the mind holds this here and then falls down because it kind of holds it and panic.

So how can I do it? How can I make this flow instead of explosion? Is something that I have been saying since the very beginning of this. This project and is the transfer so word coherence.

The only way is coherence between what I think and what I do. This is why we are doing this three weeks. The mental week , the emotional week and the physical week.

So each day we are working with the coherence between the three parts.

So for this energy to move softly and we not to get in panic we have to find coherence. When I find coherence I set myself free from all expectations. What helps me to set myself free from the doubt of what is coming.

So basically there is no more panic because you are flowing.

Now when you flow there is nothing to control.

So a speaker , instead enjoy.

So the last thing that he said for me was funny but he 's ready to the message of the hammer that said all the stars are moving. In the body of the great mother become the star. And that 's why my house said fly to the skies. Think about it.

You was talking about you shine from inside.
