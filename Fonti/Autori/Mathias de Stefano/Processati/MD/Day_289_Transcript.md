## Introduction

Hi everyone , good afternoon , good afternoon , good evening.

So let 's go to our topic for today , which is the seventh art cinema.

So this word , there is simple cinema comes from line , that means movement movement.

So cinema. The cinema has begun.

So it 's considered as an art art related to the beauty arts , even if it is not really one of the beauty. But we can put it as one , because there is nothing in history that compares to what cinema is.

So it 's the first time that something like this , that this kind of art appears in history. And it concrete , in 1895 , in the 19th century , actually is something really new.

So this is why we would not call it one of the beauty arts , and I will explain why , even though it became one.

So it started in 1895 with the brothers Luière in Paris.

So if we go back in history to understand the beauty arts , we will see that all of the beauty arts began during the Paleolithic , in between the Neolithic. Paleolithic is a period of 150 , 150,000 years ago , and the Neolithic 50,000 years ago , until 10,000 years ago. This period of time , long time ago , was the Paleolithic , meaning the old stone , and the Neolithic , meaning the new stone.

So these two periods , so how humanity discover arts , through painting , through sculpture , through music , dance , literature , and architecture.

So during that period of time , the beginning of our culture and civilization , the tribes discovered these six arts , many arts , that were the main beauty arts. That were considered like the basement of the entire history of humanity.

So all humans were designed culturally from the very beginning with these arts.

So it 's been a long time with this six arts all along the world. But what happened , cinema has only a few years. It began in 1895 , so 19th century , 150,000 years after the other beauty arts.

So this means that not all the cultures have gone through processes of assimilation cinema in their own way of living , in their blood of culture and civilization.

So even though cinema today is something that has spread around the world , this does n't mean that has touched all of them , all the humans.

So this is why we can not consider cinema as one of the beauty arts , because it 's not one of the all this ones that have gone through all the cultures. But even though today it has changed many of the perceptions that we have from the reality , it has changed and molded the vision of our humanity in many countries and cultures.

So this is why we can say that cinema is now the seventh art , is one of the beauty arts , even if it is not actually. Of course that in the middle we have photography. Photography is also one of the arts , but it 's not one of the beauty arts. It 's much more related to cinema , even if it was.

Even if it is started at the beginning of the 19th century. But it 's also very far from the other arts.

So it 's not one of the main ones because it did n't touch all the cultures as much as the cinema did or the other ones did.

So it 's kind of a , is one of the things , but it 's not considered one of the main arts. For it to be one of the beauty arts , it has to have been encoded into the culture of many thousands of beings in different cultures , different timelines.

So different throughout the history , this arts has to be related with all the beings , with all the people , for the entire population. And photography was not that , it was not something that went through all the people in every culture is not something that everyone can use or feel related to. If you think probably you would see that all the other arts has been through the common life of the people , but somehow photography did not equal the theatre. The theatre is one of the expressions of literature , okay?

So it 's a way in between other arts.

So why cinema can be taken as one of the most important arts that you can even call the 7th art , because basically cinema reunites and integrates all the rest of the arts.

So why the cinema is considered the 7th art , because basically , it unites all the other arts. Like for some , to make a movie , you need a story.

So you need literature. The literature narrates the story , the plot of a film. You need photography and painting to see the colors to understand , you mean if it is black and white , you need the framework to know how to show precisely the images. You need action , theatre , actors , actresses , you need architecture also in order to in order to make the scenery of the movie.

In its culture , if you are doing something , then you need to show , then you need to create or science fiction. You need sound in order to move the aim to put emotion in the image. You need dancing , not only just for dance , but also for the movement of the person that is showing something , how it moves , how it interpreted.

So as you see cinema needs all the other arts and put all the other arts together. It connected and put movement into it. It moves.

So from this we can say that not only from the passive point of view , the cinema put everything together , unites the six main as one and sets movement into that. But also , as its name is Saint-Waz , sub-debtively , it also moves us within. It moves our souls. Cinema began with the Luière brothers in Paris because they came from a family that their father was photographer.

So what they did was basically photos , one aside the other one , one aside the other.

So when you take many pictures , one , many frames like photographs , many photographs , but they did was to put all these photos into into a very thin skin , that in Latin , skin is kelly and tiny is alla.

So pelly-cool , pelly-kool is the name of that cello skin.

So the cello skin was the pelly-kill , okay , which this pelly-kill was moving all the time.

So that 's why we call it movies. They are in movement moving constantly.

So they were made of cello , that 's why we also call the cinema the cello.

So what they did actually was to put a light behind it and our eyes can not perceive in many pixels.

So as fast it moves the pelly-kool that the around.

So we see all the pictures moving like fast and we perceive movement in the in the screen , but actually it 's not , actually it 's basically many pictures , one along the other one.

So the first the first movies that were done with with color , they were painted.

So here 's the painter. Each one of the of the photographs were painted.

So what they did was was to paint everything. They used maybe three or four colors. That 's why the old movies had kind of the same colors , all of them.

So the first movies that the Luière did were not a movie like we know today. They were just photographs in movement.

So they would just film a train or film a factory , but that 's it. Common situations of life in movement.

So no narrative , no plot on the story.

So of course that they had no idea how to use it for because there was no purpose on doing that. They were wondering , so what is the use for this?

So it was n't until it arrived to the states , of course , that people started to design a tiny little story a few seconds or a minute to tell a story that entertained people , not only by watching images moving , but also telling something.

So of course that eventually Editor , of course , he started to follow everyone trying to to forbid everyone to do this movie because he said that he had invented something before that was that.

So what they were doing is worse than illegal.

So all the producers that were starting to do this kind of tiny movies , they went all to the new state that was created , which was California. California started to become free part of the states. Even though it was very much populated by Mexican , so that 's why it was very Christian and all the names of the places were related to the Bible. Life , for example , the Holy Wood , which is the cross , the Holy Wood , and they created the first places to roll to make the movies in that little town.

And they started to do what we know today , of course. What happened , and here we go with the concept of stopping that I to rage , which is the movement within. The context of that moment , of that time , was that the state was receiving a lot of people from other parts of the world , mainly Europe , that they had many wars , hunger , and they were suffering a lot in different parts of the world.

So they started to go into , they started to go into the states , to live in the states , escaping from hunger and wars and poverty.

So they wanted to become free and also there were other people that started to be free after slavery.

So a lot of people that had no idea how to read or how to understand English. Everyone was speaking their own languages.

So a lot of people , more people than the same population of the states , that started to come and to live in the states without knowing any word of English.

So the only way in which people had to communicate the states , the laws , the propaganda , was through images , in movement.

So cinema was very important at that time to help people to communicate , to know what was going on. It 's in this moment , the reason why cinema started to become something really , then it 's all unimportant. Because what we knew through the cinema was not like the news we read on the paper. The images in movement , they were showing us emotions , movement , actions , things that moved ourselves that we can need to.

So what the cinema did was to to take the , to not only inform and send information , notify about things , but also to tell us story.

So suddenly the people started to act to show emotions , to show histories , stories , stories , stories , ideas that could move people than watch.

So it was kind of a theatre , but in great case , so one of the important things that does here , the cinema , is that a city is able to show us what we expect. It also like literature takes us to imagination , cinema can show us what is coming in the future. It can show us science fiction , things that we expect.

So cinema not only started to show entertainment , but also to promote technology , science ideas , revolutions , and of course philosophy.

So it started to be a way to awaken the people or to set people to sleep , depending on who is controlling it. In the 19th century , with the second industrial revolution , the speed of growth was so fast that everything started to go quicker. This took the people to realize that there was no much time now to read much books , to do minmarks , because whatever you study or whatever you want to do in , suddenly , if you take longer , suddenly it was obsolete. It changed so much that it was so fast that you could n't adapt.

So cinema was kind of the way in which a lot of people could receive many data in a short period of time. This is why the cinema became such an important tool.

So what happened that there was until not much time before , the cinema controlled by those who could pay the cinema.

So kind of the stories were told according to the beliefs of the person that put the money to make the story. But the electronic revolution with the technology of this past two decades , what did you have in the independent cinema? Which means that all the stories that before were able to be told , now are being able to be told.

So this is why they more than ever , many stories and many things can be said , can be told to a weak , different ideas to make it think , not only entertain.

So today talking about the inner movement , cinema can be the only art that can really change the consciousness of the world. Because minimized one that can hold all the other parts together and give them a purpose. This is why the change of consciousness is in the hands of cinema. And of course we have many things in cinema , many options.

And the problem is not the people that is sending about message through cinema. The conflict here is what are we choosing? What do we choose to see? To watch?

## Q&A

Because it 's about us , the viewers , which depends the content of the movies. It 's about what we are asking for.

So of course that when you see cinema , you will see kind of what the people in the world is waiting for. And if you take a look , you will see that there are many content right now that is about waiting. Many things that takes us to think. Of course that there are many other things that does n't give you anything.

But you can tell that there is people waiting in because of the content that we see in the movies today. This is why minimized is one of the main arts that can help into the change of consciousness. Because it moves within the people to make it part of a story , moving the inside in order to push ourselves to change and move the outside. Cinema means movement.

So if we want to move , I invite you to look for movies to watch movies that can move yourself within.

So then you can inspire in order to move the world outside.

So also by saying a movie that awakens consciousness is not movies of spirituality. It 's not related. It does n't matter. It 's about literature.

It 's about interpretation of the message. It 's art.

So in a movie , you wo n't see the precisely message like this is like this and you will have to do that on that. That would be called a documentary or propaganda. What we have to understand is that it 's art and it can show the different ways of something.

So every viewer can perceive something different.

## Daily Practice Elements
