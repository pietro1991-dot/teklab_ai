## Overview

We're on **Day 3 of the Emotional Week of Libra**, working with the **Throat chakra** and exploring **Cognition and Ignorance**.

Before we dive in, Matías acknowledges that Mercury is still retrograde and affecting communication. He apologizes in advance if things feel confusing or unclear—this planetary influence makes it challenging to express concepts precisely. This humility and transparency are important; even teachers experience cosmic cycles that affect their ability to transmit information clearly.

**Cognition and Ignorance** might seem like clear opposites—knowing versus not knowing. We typically think:
- Cognition = intelligence, understanding, wisdom
- Ignorance = stupidity, not knowing, being uninformed

But as always in these teachings, we're going deeper than surface definitions.

Today we'll discover a revolutionary perspective: **The first information you receive is not through the mind—it's through EMOTIONS.** And we'll see that modern civilization, despite having more information than ever before in history, may actually be the **most ignorant civilization** precisely because we have so much information that we've learned to deliberately deny what doesn't fit our preferences.

This teaching will fundamentally change how you understand knowing, learning, and the relationship between heart and mind.

## Core Teaching

### The Root: Gnosis

Both **cognition** and **ignorance** come from the same root word: **GNOSIS**.

**Gnosis** means knowledge or wisdom.

In ancient times, **Gnostic people** were those who were constant students. They were people who would take information from all sides, from all sources, from all parts of knowledge, and would try to unify and understand it.

A Gnostic person is someone who tries to seek for knowledge and wisdom everywhere, not just in one specific field or one specific belief system.

This is important because both our words today share this root of seeking wisdom and knowledge.

### Cognition: CO-GNOSIS (Putting Knowledge Together)

**Cognition comes from CO + GNOSIS:**

- **CO** = together, with (like co-worker, co-pilot, co-exist)
- **GNOSIS** = knowledge, knowing, wisdom

**So cognition literally means: putting together the knowing, putting together the wisdom.**

**Cognition is the ability to put different concepts, different knowledge, different information together.**

It's not just about having information. It's about **connecting that information, relating different pieces of knowledge to each other, seeing how different concepts interact and create understanding.**

When you put different information together, you create a broader understanding, a deeper wisdom.

### Ignorance: IN-GNOSIS (Cannot Hold Knowledge Together)

**Ignorance comes from IN + GNOSIS:**

- **IN** = not, without, denial (like invisible, incomplete, incorrect)
- **GNOSIS** = knowledge, knowing, wisdom

**So ignorance means: to not have the gnosis, to be without the capacity to hold or receive or understand the knowledge together.**

**Ignorance means that you cannot hold the information together. You cannot receive or understand the information as connected.**

Ignorance is the opposite of cognition—not because you don't have information, but because **you cannot or will not connect the information you have.**

### Agnostic: Without Metaphysics

There's another related word we should understand: **AGNOSTIC**.

**Agnostic means: without gnosis, without wisdom.**

In spiritual terms, agnostic people don't believe in anything metaphysical. They only believe in what is physical, what can be proven physically, what can be touched and measured.

**For agnostic people, there is no metaphysics—only physics.**

This is an important distinction because it shows how the same root word (gnosis) creates different relationships with knowledge and reality.

### The Revolutionary Truth: Emotions Come First

Here's where the teaching gets profound and challenges everything we've been taught:

**The first information that you receive is NOT through your mind.**

**The first information that you receive is through EMOTIONS.**

Let's understand what this means:

**Emotions are pulses—impulses, movements of energy** that come inside, that go outside. They're like electrical impulses moving through your being.

**These pulses create FEELINGS.**

**Feelings are more metaphysical than physical.** You cannot touch them. You cannot see them. They're internal experiences.

**Then your brain uses the data of these feelings to act toward the outside, to respond to the world.**

This is the actual sequence:
1. **Emotional pulse** (energy impulse)
2. **Feeling** (metaphysical experience of that pulse)
3. **Mental processing** (brain using feeling-data to understand and respond)

Most people think it goes: See something → Think about it → Feel about it.

But the truth is: Feel something (emotion/pulse) → Experience it (feeling) → Understand it (cognition using the feeling-data).

### The Process of Cognition: From Feeling to Knowing

**Cognition works like this:**

You bring all this separated information from the outside world **inside yourself**.

This information comes first as **feelings**—emotional pulses, energetic data.

Then you **put these feelings together, connect them, relate them to each other**.

**This is wisdom: connecting feelings, understanding the relationships between different emotional/energetic data.**

When you achieve this connection of different feelings and information, when you see how they relate—**that is cognition.**

**Cognition is the process of bringing separated information within, connecting it through feeling, and creating wisdom.**

### The Process of Ignorance: Deliberate Denial

**Ignorance works like this:**

You receive information (through emotional pulses, through feelings).

But instead of connecting it, instead of allowing it to relate to other information you have—**you pick only one thing**.

**You deliberately ignore the rest of the information.**

**This is ignorance: to receive information but to deny it deliberately, to refuse to connect it with other information you have.**

### Two Types of Not-Knowing

It's important to distinguish two different states:

**1. Unknown (no data available)**
- You genuinely don't have the information
- You haven't encountered the knowledge
- It's not accessible to you yet
- This is simply **not knowing**

**2. Ignorant (data available but denied)**
- You DO have the information
- It IS accessible to you
- But you choose to deny it, ignore it, refuse to see it
- This is **ignorance**

The difference is crucial: **Ignorance is not the absence of knowledge—it's the refusal to acknowledge knowledge that's available.**

### Modern Civilization: The Most Ignorant in History

This leads to a shocking conclusion:

**Modern civilization is probably the most ignorant civilization in all of history.**

Not because we don't have information—**we have MORE information than any civilization before us.**

But **we are more ignorant because we have learned to deny information that doesn't fit what we want to believe.**

**We have so much information available, yet we deliberately choose to ignore most of it and only pay attention to what confirms what we already think.**

This is the paradox of the information age: **More information has created more ignorance** because we've become expert at filtering out anything that challenges us.

### The School System: 300 Years of Giving Answers

Part of the problem comes from how we've structured education:

**For the last 300 years, the school system has been giving us answers instead of teaching us the process of cognition.**

Schools teach: "Here is the answer. Memorize this. This is what you need to know."

They DON'T teach: "Here's how to connect different pieces of information. Here's how to think. Here's how to process and relate concepts to create your own understanding."

**We've been trained to receive answers, not to develop cognition.**

**We've been trained to accept information passively, not to actively connect and question and relate information.**

For 300 years, generation after generation has been trained in this passive receiving of pre-digested "truth" instead of learning the active process of creating understanding through connection.

### The Internet Problem: Information Overload Without Discernment

The internet has amplified this problem exponentially:

**We now have access to ALL the information we could ever want.**

But we have **no training in discernment**. We have no education in **how to process and connect information**, how to determine what's useful, how to relate different sources.

**Result: We're drowning in information but starving for wisdom.**

We have access to knowledge everywhere, but we don't know how to **put it together** (cognition). Instead, we pick what we like and ignore the rest (ignorance).

This creates a civilization where everyone has "facts" to support whatever they want to believe, and no one has the cognitive skills to connect different perspectives into broader understanding.

### It's Not the System's Fault—It's Ours

Here's an uncomfortable truth:

**We cannot just blame "the system" or "the schools" or "the internet" or "the government."**

**The system is made of individuals.**

And those individuals were shaped by their families.

**If we're ignorant, it's because our families trained us to be ignorant—not maliciously, but because THEY were trained to be ignorant by THEIR families.**

This has been going on for generations.

**The responsibility is not "out there"—it's within each of us.**

We have the power to break the cycle of ignorance by choosing cognition—by choosing to connect information instead of filtering it, by choosing to learn the process instead of just collecting answers.

### The Unity Code: Everything is One

The **Unity Code** that accompanies today's teaching states:

**"Everything that exists is the hologram of a unique particle. A particle that vibrates in everything. Expressing infinite variations of itself. Everything that exists is me. And all variation is me expressing in different ways."**

What does this have to do with cognition and ignorance?

**If everything is one**, if all information is ultimately connected (because everything comes from the same source), then:

- **Cognition is recognizing this unity**—seeing how different pieces of information are connected because they all come from the same source
- **Ignorance is denying this unity**—treating information as separate, competing, contradictory pieces that cannot be reconciled

The universe is a hologram. Every part contains information about the whole. **True cognition sees this. Ignorance fragments it.**

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch your body. Yawn. Cross your limbs.

Relax your body, focusing on your breathing.

### Becoming Wind

Start to perceive the air coming inside your body.

Feel how it moves inside you, making you feel like you are empty.

Only air and wind is spinning within you. Feel the air around your body connecting with the air within your body.

Feel yourself soft and light like a feather.

### The Soul's Energy

Perceive the energy of your body moving like wind within your body in a spiral of colors.

Expressing outside through the skin like a twister around you.

### Illuminating the Throat

Put your hands facing the sky at the height of your heart.

Perceive the light of the I Am, of the sun, coming towards you, going through the crown and anchoring in your throat with a beautiful turquoise color.

Perceive the turquoise light coming down through your throat, down through your heart, and into your hands, filling them with this beautiful light.

### Integration: Cognition in One Hand, Ignorance in the Other

**In one hand, perceive the concept of COGNITION.**

All the different parts of information, data, concepts, and knowledge that you have gathered through your feelings and experiences—they're all connecting, relating, creating understanding. This is cognition.

**In your other hand, you have IGNORANCE.**

The deliberate denial of information, the refusal to connect, the filtering out of anything that challenges you. The separation of knowledge into disconnected pieces.

### Understanding Both

Become aware that **cognition is what helps you grow, evolve, expand your understanding by connecting different information through your feelings.**

Become aware that **ignorance is what keeps you small, stuck, limited by refusing to see connections and denying information that's available.**

### The Choice

Recognize that **both potentials exist within you in every moment.**

In every situation where you encounter new information or challenging perspectives:
- Will you connect it with what you already know? (cognition)
- Or will you deny it because it's uncomfortable? (ignorance)

**This choice is happening constantly, every day, in small moments and large ones.**

### Unification

Take both hands to your throat, bringing cognition and awareness of ignorance both as one within your throat—your center of truth and expression.

Unify them with the vibration of your being:

**SSsher... SSsher... SSsher... SSsher...**

**"I Am the Flux of Truth."**

All information flows through me. I receive it first through emotions and feelings. I have the power to connect it (cognition) or deny it (ignorance).

**I choose cognition. I choose to connect. I choose to see the unity in all information.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and start to spread this consciousness, stretching, caressing, and yawning.

Come back here and now, opening your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Catching Yourself in Ignorance

This is uncomfortable but essential work:

**Throughout your day, notice when you encounter information that contradicts something you believe or makes you uncomfortable.**

Pay attention to your immediate reaction:
- Do you dismiss it immediately?
- Do you think "That's wrong" without examining why?
- Do you avoid it, change the subject, or distract yourself?
- Do you look for reasons to discredit the source?

**These are moments of ignorance—not stupidity, but deliberate denial.**

**Then practice cognition:**
- What if this information AND my current belief are both pieces of a larger truth?
- How might these seemingly contradictory pieces connect?
- What would I understand if I held both pieces together instead of choosing one?

You don't have to change your beliefs. You're just **practicing the cognitive process of connection instead of the ignorant process of denial.**

### Emotions-First Awareness

Challenge the mind-first assumption:

**Notice that you FEEL things before you think about them.**

When you meet someone: You feel comfort or discomfort before you think "I like/don't like this person."

When you encounter an idea: You feel resonance or resistance before you think "This is true/false."

When you face a situation: You feel opening or closing before you think "This is good/bad."

**Your feelings are data.** They're the first information. Your mind's job is to **use this feeling-data**, not to override it or ignore it.

Practice: **"What am I feeling right now? What is this feeling telling me before my mind creates a story about it?"**

### The School of Cognition You Never Had

Since school didn't teach you cognitive process, teach yourself:

**Practice connecting different pieces of information:**

Take two concepts that seem unrelated or contradictory:
- Science and spirituality
- Logic and intuition
- Individual freedom and collective responsibility
- Your pain and someone else's pain

**Ask: "If both are true, how do they connect? What larger truth contains both?"**

This is the Gnostic approach—gathering wisdom from all sources and connecting it, rather than choosing one source and denying all others.

### Family Pattern Recognition (Without Blame)

Matías said we're shaped by our families, who were shaped by theirs, in cycles of learned ignorance.

**Gently observe (without judgment):**
- What topics were "off limits" in your family?
- What information sources were dismissed or forbidden?
- What beliefs were you taught to accept without question?
- What questions were you discouraged from asking?

This isn't about blaming your family. It's about **recognizing the patterns of ignorance that were passed down unconsciously.**

Once you see them, you can choose differently. You can break the cycle by choosing cognition.

## Q&A

### Q: Are you saying I should believe everything I encounter? That seems dangerous.

**No. Cognition is not about believing everything—it's about CONNECTING everything.** You can hold two contradictory pieces of information without accepting either as absolute truth. You're looking for how they relate, what larger pattern they reveal together. Believing everything = ignorance (accepting without processing). Denying everything that challenges you = ignorance (refusing available information). Cognition = holding multiple perspectives and seeing how they connect to reveal deeper truth.

### Q: How can emotions be the "first information" when emotions are often wrong or misleading?

**Emotions aren't "wrong"—they're data.** They're giving you information about energetic reality, about resonance and dissonance. The problem isn't that emotions are unreliable; it's that we've been taught to dismiss them as "irrational" instead of learning to READ them accurately. Your feeling of discomfort around someone might be picking up on something your mind doesn't consciously see yet. That's not "wrong"—it's DATA. The mind's job is to use that feeling-data wisely, not to dismiss it or be enslaved by it.

### Q: If modern civilization is so ignorant, why have we advanced so much technologically?

**Because we've developed incredible TECHNICAL cognition (connecting information within specific fields) while developing massive HOLISTIC ignorance (denying information across fields).** We can connect concepts within physics or medicine or engineering brilliantly. But we're ignorant about how technology connects to ecology, how economy connects to human wellbeing, how progress connects to meaning. We're cognitively brilliant in narrow fields and ignorant about the larger connections. That's why we're destroying our planet while sending rovers to Mars.

### Q: Isn't some information just false and deserves to be ignored?

**There's a difference between discernment and ignorance.** Discernment says: "This information is inaccurate based on evidence, but I understand WHY it exists, what need it meets, how it connects to the larger pattern of human meaning-making." Ignorance says: "This is false, I refuse to look at it or understand why anyone believes it." Even "false" information contains data—about human psychology, cultural needs, the search for meaning. True cognition asks: "What is this information (even if inaccurate) telling me about reality, human nature, or the search for truth?"

### Q: How do I know if I'm in cognition or just confused by holding too much contradictory information?

**Confusion is often a necessary stage in the cognitive process.** When you're connecting information that seemed contradictory, there's a period where nothing makes sense—your old framework is dissolving but the new understanding hasn't emerged yet. This discomfort is why most people retreat to ignorance (picking one thing and denying the rest feels more comfortable than confusion). But if you stay with the confusion, if you keep holding the pieces together without forcing resolution, understanding emerges. Cognition feels like: "Ah! I see how these connect now." That clarity comes AFTER confusion, not instead of it.

### Q: What if my family is still stuck in ignorance? How do I not blame them?

**Understanding the cycle doesn't mean condoning it—it means seeing it clearly without adding the pain of blame to the pain of the pattern.** Your family was trained in ignorance by their family, who was trained by their family... This doesn't make it right, but it makes it comprehensible. Your work is to break the cycle in yourself—not to change them, fix them, or make them wrong. By choosing cognition in your own life, you create a new pattern. That's your power and your responsibility. Their journey is their own.

### Q: Isn't intuition (which comes before thought) different from emotions?

**Intuition, emotion, and feeling are all part of the pre-cognitive information stream.** They're different flavors of the same phenomenon: energetic/metaphysical data that arrives before mental processing. Intuition might be clearer, more direct knowing. Emotion might be more reactive, more intense. Feeling might be more subtle, more ongoing. But they're all DATA arriving before thought. The mind's job is to use ALL this metaphysical data to create understanding—not to privilege thought as the "real" information and dismiss everything that comes before/beyond thought.

### Q: How do I practice cognition when I'm overwhelmed by information?

**By being selective about INPUT but connective about PROCESSING.** You don't need to consume every piece of information available (that's impossible and exhausting). Choose your sources wisely. BUT—when you encounter information that challenges you or seems to contradict what you know, that's when you practice cognition. Don't add more information; instead, CONNECT the information you already have. Most overwhelm comes from accumulating without connecting. Slow down. Go deeper. Connect what you have. That's cognition.

## Closing Reflection

Today we've explored **Cognition and Ignorance**—two concepts that reveal the foundation of how we know, how we learn, and how we create understanding.

**Cognition is not about being smart or educated.** It's about the practice of **connecting information instead of collecting it**, of putting together different pieces through the data of our feelings and emotions to create wisdom.

**Ignorance is not about being stupid or uninformed.** It's about the habit (often unconscious) of **denying information that's available because it challenges us, makes us uncomfortable, or doesn't fit our current framework.**

We live in the most informed and possibly the most ignorant civilization in history—not because information isn't available, but because we've mastered the art of filtering out anything that doesn't confirm what we already believe.

**The revolutionary insight is this: The first information you receive is not through your mind—it's through emotions and feelings.**

Your mind's job is not to be the source of knowing. Your mind's job is to **use the metaphysical data of feelings and emotions to create understanding**.

When you understand this, you stop dismissing your feelings as "irrational" and start reading them as DATA. You stop over-privileging thought and start recognizing it as one part of a larger cognitive process.

**The Unity Code teaches us that everything is one**—variations of a single particle expressing infinitely.

If this is true, then **all information is ultimately connected**. Cognition is recognizing these connections. Ignorance is denying them.

Your work is to **catch yourself in moments of ignorance**—when you're dismissing, denying, filtering, rejecting information because it's uncomfortable.

And to choose **cognition instead**—holding seemingly contradictory information together, asking "How do these connect? What larger truth contains both?"

This is uncomfortable. Confusion is part of the process. The mind wants certainty (as we learned in Day 71), so it pushes you toward ignorance (pick one thing, deny the rest, feel certain).

But **your soul grows through cognition—through the willingness to hold complexity, to see connections, to expand beyond comfortable certainties into larger understanding.**

**"I Am the Flux of Truth."**

Truth flows through you constantly in the form of emotional pulses, feelings, energetic data. Your choice is whether to connect this flux (cognition) or filter it (ignorance).

Choose connection. Choose to see unity. Choose to learn the cognitive process you were never taught.

See you tomorrow for Day 74, as we continue the Emotional Week.

Rest well. Drink water. Notice what information you're denying.
