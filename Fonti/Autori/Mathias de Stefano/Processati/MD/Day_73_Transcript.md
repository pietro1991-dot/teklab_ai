## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good evening , good night , whatever.

So , come another day , today connecting with the throat chara.

So , remember that we are in the emotional week in the month of Libre.

So , just to let you know , from today , from yesterday , from today , we are in the effect of mercury reds or grade.

So , for your , will be difficult for you to understand me , even difficult for myself to understand myself. Communication problems.

So , if there is something you do n't get , if there is something you do n't understand , just wait for another 15 days and watch these videos again.

So , just for all the people that does n't know what is mercury reds or grade , we will have that for another 10 to 15 days. And this is something that happens around 3 times a year. And this means that mercury , the planet , the one that is closer to this , it has a very fast , fast , oh , orbits around the sun.

So , that means that from the point of view of Earth , sometimes the planet seems like if it moves backwards , because it moves so fast , sometimes we see it going this way. And suddenly we see it going it in this way.

So , it 's just a point from our planet that we see that. But we call it retrograde because like going backwards.

Okay , so , so from the point of view of this planet , it seems like if the planet of communication , which is mercury , it 's not communicating very well because it 's not going forward , it 's going backwards , so it 's like talking backwards.

So , nobody ca n't really understand what is happening and sometimes technology , communications fails.

So , this is why this maybe will be kind of weird to try to explain things.

So , I apologize in advance. This is natural , this is not something new , this is something that we have at least three per year , every year of our lives.

So , this is something common , just to know a little bit.

So , what we are going to talk about today is about the cognitive and the ignorance.

So , I will start as I started the topic today in the blog , which is that I felt like we 're that I received these two words for today , cognitive and ignorance , because I would relate them with the mind related with the process of the mental aspect of our work. But the explanation that I believe was that the first thing that we , the first way in which we receive information in our bodies is by feelings and emotions.

So , this is why we have to understand first how we receive all this data in order to acknowledge it.

So , let 's go into this.

So , first of all , the concept of cognition and ignorance , ignorance comes both of them from the same word from ancient times , which is gross. Gross is the name of wisdom , is the name of knowledge.

So , this was the name in which people would refer to those who are trying to understand all the things.

So , for sure you have heard about the groups of gross , the gross people , they are students , constant students , they take information from anything , from religions , philosophies , science , traditions , whatever you can , different colors. They could , they would take information from many , it plays to understand it , to perceive it , to assimilate it , and always study more about any issue , about any concepts.

So , that would be gross. For sure you should know the word , well , no , the knowledge , okay. The word knowledge also has similarity with the word , call no , okay , gross , call no , no , okay. This is the sound of this word.

So , it means co , it 's like together , to put all together , and no , no , gross , gross comes from the concept of wisdom or knowledge , okay.

So , all the things that you could understand.

So , knowing , okay , knowing would be , the connection of things that now I put together , okay.

So , I put together all the things that would be to know the concept of knowing or cognition , okay , which is to know something. The process , the word of cognitive , cognitive would be the ability to put all the different concepts , all the different knowledge is together , okay.

So , it 's the ability to know how to understand something. That 's cognitive , okay.

So , in the other hand , what we have is ignorance.

So , ignorance comes from the word in , in , and no-series , which is the same concept like before , but this one can not hold information , can not receive and understand the whole information , putting together.

So , this is ignorance , okay. This is what it means. If the process of cognitive , of cognition , would be to take the different concepts and to put them together to give them a logic within me , would be so that there is that the opposite , the ignorance or the incognito , okay , the incognito would be something that I can not understand , that the parts are there and I can not understand them. Also , we have another word that comes from all this that you may have heard , which is agnostic , okay.

So , agnostic would be someone without gross.

So , gross means to know things , to other things , the conjunction of things , how they are connected.

So , this is why throughout the time , the gross has been trying to find meaning of the connection of all the things.

So , this is why it 's more metaphysics , okay.

So , the gross is known by the metaphysics because it 's trying to explain what is beyond physics , that 's metaphysics means beyond physics.

So , every that connects physical aspects , which is more philosophical , but in the other hand , the agnostics are those that there is nothing , are those that say that there is nothing metaphysics , there is nothing metaphysics , that everything is here and now and everything is physical.

So , there is no connection between the things.

So , this is why they almost are those who are without gross , without the metaphysics concepts of reality. One of the things that we today think is that the physics is the only way in which you can ignore something , is that you believe that the common people believe that. . .

To hold an information , to receive an information , you have to read a book , to do some things specific , and all this knowledge will come to your mind by logic , okay.

So , this is why we , the logic of the mind says , everything has to be physical in order to be understandable. But in the other hand , what we have is that the connection of the things is not by physics , is by metaphysics. Metaphysics is , as I said , something that goes beyond physics , but it does n't mean that it 's something different from physics. It means that something that moves in a different way than physics.

So , this is why we should not say that cognitive process is only through the mind , because the main way in which the cognitive process works is through metaphysics. The way in which we interpret information , basically , is like this. Everything around , everything that we have around , has an impulse in us.

So , we receive the information from the outside through the pulses that we call emotions. Emotions are the main information that we receive from the other world.

So , these pulses of emotions are creating links of information of data that we receive from the outside , create what we call fillings , the sensations.

So , this sensitive aspect of the self creates the conjunction of data , pulses of information that creates a feeling. The feeling is something that we would call metaphysics , because the information is ordered within ourselves is something that is impossible to explain. It 's something that we do n't have the physics to understand how this works.

So , this information is storage is compressed within ourselves. And after that , what happened is that the brain is using data. That 's that information in order to perceive the word outside.

So , the emotion is not processed by the brain specifically , is storage and created by the fillings and the fillings give the information to the brain , secure , act towards the outside. This is why we call the process of acknowledging the process of knowing the cognitive process as something that is met a physical. Because something physical would be to say that our body is made up with atoms.

So , we are all atoms , very well organized. And no physical explanation for poetry , for example.

So , poetry making something artistic is something that is not explained in the conjunction of atoms.

So , that 's what we call metaphysics , because we can not explain it by the laws of physics.

So , that 's what the Agnostic people would attach to the concept of soul.

So , basically , I was trying to explain this because everything that we have lived in our everything that we have understood that we have acknowledged assimilated in our life as something learned in our life. And this is just because we have been , because we felt it emotionally and with fillings in the moment we were living that. Like , for example , as we have said once before , right in the bicycle , it was something emotional.

So , you learned that because it was emotional to play an instrument , to learn something in the school for sure. If there is something that you hold , like this is really important for you and you got it at the first time , is because maybe the teacher had was really good. Because it created an emotion on the tick.

So , usually happens that , that the first information that we are able to integrate in ourselves is because of the moment. This is why also we have to understand that emotion , that the way we got information is by the emotion. Emotion is like this , more code , like doing , like this , by pulses , electrical pulses , that , that storage information. And then the mind reads that information.

So , what we usually do in school is to learn , like , we do n't learn when we memorize things. Like , for example , when we say the French Revolution was in 1780 , 89. Yes.

So , when we say those data , it 's like we have a storage because it 's memorize when you repeated so many times. That 's from the mind , but it 's not from the soul.

So , when you acknowledge the information and you share the information and you are willing to show what you know , to share the information with others , there is the moment when you are really activating , when you are really activating the learning process.

So , it 's because you feel emotion when you say it , if you feel emotion when you express it. And it can be a negative energy or positive emotion , positive or negative emotion , that storage information.

So , this is why the AM was trying to explain today that the process of cognition and ignorance goes through the emotional process. The process of cognition is something that words basically like this. Around you have a lot of information , data , knowledge that is all separated. And so , I bring all this information within and I put them all together within myself.

So , all this knowledge now by the feeling is connected.

So , they start to be understood by the links between of them.

So , when you connect them all , you call this knowledge as wisdom.

Okay?

So , this is how you create wisdom inside.

So , when I see the different things in front of me , I can see them , they are there. And then I absorb them and make just one thing out of all of them. That 's the cognitive process.

So , in the other hand , when I see all the things in front of me , and I just pick one , and keep just only one for me. And that I do n't care about the rest. That 's what we call the process of ignorance.

So , the reason why we call ignorance to that is because precisely , is to take only one and stay out in ignorance. Stay out of the other knowledge.

So , ignorance basically means to ignore something that I know is there , but I do n't see it. I do n't want to see it.

So , for example , global warming. There is a lot of information that can show you that there is global warming. You can feel it. You can see the weather changing , of course.

So , whoever is denying the global warming basically is in the process of ignorance of a lot of data and information. That is there. There are two different ways of being ignorant. One of them is to , how to say it in English , to unknown , unknown would be , yes.

One is to be ignorant , and the other one would be to not know , basically , the opposite to no.

So , the person that does n't know is not ignorant. The person that does n't know does n't have the data in front. It just does n't know anything about the issue.

So , an ignorant is the person that has the possibility to have the information , but the nice information. That 's the ignorant. The other person is someone that is trying to learn and does n't have the information. We can not say that a person that does n't know all the information is an ignorant.

An ignorant is someone that even if he or she has the possibility of no of having the information , decides to deny it. That 's an ignorant.

So , to explain about our currentization. 300 years ago , civilization , humans , all humanity was people unaware. They had no option to know. They had no idea how to know things , because there was no possibility to acknowledge things.

But now , we are civilization connected with thousands and billions of possibilities to know information.

So , this is why we , this society , is the most ignorant society that has ever been in the human history. We are the civilization of ignorance. We are a civilization of ignorance , because even if we have the information out there , we decide to deny it. Why this problem has started?

Because 300 years ago , school was created.

So , school was designed to give information. But the information that this gives is in a book. And they say , here are all the answers. You have to swallow them.

All information that was in the world was crewed before.

So , you can have it here.

So , swallow it.

So , what happened? It has been 300 years at a civilization that has n't been prepared for the cognitive process. Because cognition means to grab information from the outside and create your own wisdom within. Let 's cognition.

But without the process of looking for information to create the answer and having just the answer , you lost the whole process of a civilization of 300 years without the possibility to make the cognition process.

So , now , what we have is a civilization with internet. We have so much information , so much information that we can learn about anything. But suddenly , we have to learn.

So , suddenly , we have to discern the information that we are reading.

So , suddenly , we do n't know what is the truth , because 300 years have been taught. That information is in this book. We have n't been working in trying to make the process by ourselves.

So , suddenly , we have so much information that we have to discern which is the truth.

So , our nature would say , I do n't know , so anything is the truth. I do n't know. I do n't care. And that 's it.

So , let 's be in the next episode.

So , let 's think about this. Do n't blame the system , because we would say the school did it wrong. The school made it wrong.

So , the whole system is screwed up because of education. But hold on. Because we usually try to blame education as if it is the tool for the governments to call population and so on. Do n't blame anyone.

Listen to this. What happened is that education wanted to give the civilization a tool to know everything. But , but , when wrong. Because they were trying to do something as they thought it was the best.

But now thinking in a different way. If you 're parents , or you have had parents. For sure , someone in your life , in your childhood , or yourself have said to other ones. They would say to other ones , be careful.

Do n't , do n't do this. Do n't go over the table because you 're going to fall. Have you heard this synthesis? You first have a synthesis constantly.

And usually comes from a man and that. From those persons that tells constantly , be careful. You go down , you can hurt , etc. Basically , I want just to say that I did n't read in people saying no , it 's the illuminate are the guilty one.

Oh , blame on the church or whatever religion , whatever. No , just stop there. And think about this. There is no system that is willing to control us.

The system is made up with people. The people create the system. The individual is the individual. The individual is born in a family.

The individual is the one that created the individual.

So all the systems , religion , capitalism , whatever you want to call it. All those systems. Has been born from the mind of an individual. And that mind of the individual was aided through the family.

And that knowledge. That the main problem we have are from the way in which we learn since we are kids , the information from the outside. How we know how we achieve the information from our family.

So basically what the education was trying to do was to give all information that we had n't been able to receive in thousands of years and give all of that to us in just five years.

So all that information was received by us and this created the opposite reaction of the expected. The opposite reaction would be to deny information to deny everything we become ignored. We have a lot of things to talk about this , but the time is running to wrap the idea. And as a summary to remember that in order to activate the process of cognition , we have to allow ourselves to feel more , to feel to be more sensitive to the information that we receive , to perceive ourselves to.

So remember that ignorance is to deny things that you know you have in front of you.

## Q&A

So the question would be how many things have you denied and ignored throughout your life.

So we have to know our ignorance. I have too many ideas to say in my bed. I want to shout out.

So yes , we have 270 days more.

So we are going to talk about this more for sure. 930 already.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the vibration of the day. The statement is I am the flux of truth. The code for today unity. It says everything that was a part now is now is as a unity.

All the degrees of the sphere , everything lived in each time and space is now as one in the center in the center. Unity is the universal concept that everything that exists is not really a part. But everything that exists is simply an hologram of a unique particle in intense vibration. For that , no matter where you are , you will always be in the center.

So we begin stretching the body. Messaging the body. And you are. We feel comfortable with the comforts.

I focus in my breathing. I see you take a deep breath , feel the air coming inside , spinning around. Like a twitter , feeling the void inside the air with your body light as a feather. I feel the air outside connecting with the air within me.

I feel the energy of my body start to speed the air going out through the skin. I 'm spinning around my body as a colorful twitter. I put my hands facing the sky at the height of my heart. I allow myself to perceive the light of the sun coming through my head.

## Energy Work

Take a deep breath and feel the light of the eye coming through the crown. Cross them through the third eye and anchor in the throat chara. I perceive within my throat a beautiful blue light that debate into two rays that goes to the palms of my hands. I can now up them , feeling them up with blue.

In one of my hands , I find all my tip-breath process. And in the other one , I find all the things that I ignore. I become aware that the concepts of cognition and ignorance coexist within me. And both of them creates the idea of how my soul interprets the world.

I become aware that ignorance was trying to protect myself from all those things that scares me.

So I acknowledge its purpose , life. And the cognitive process is the one that helps me to be more wise , to understand the idea of the world. I take my hands to my heart and unify these two concepts and acknowledging that both of them are born from wisdom , from the masses. And I unify them with my sound , remembering that I am the flux of all truth.

I am the flux of all truth. I am the flux of all truth. I am the flux of all truth. I take a deep breath and click.

Start to carry this , bring in this consciousness by stretching , messaging and joining. And I come back and now slowly opening my eyes.

So like this , we have integrated in ourselves this aspect of the I am.

So here is always for being there , for putting like in these videos , so much more people can find them. And for being there , being important.

So see you tomorrow as always at the same time. Maybe tomorrow we will cover her hair. I do n't know.

Today I will cover like this with the hair like that.

So I do n't know. Libre takes me really crazy. I do n't understand.
