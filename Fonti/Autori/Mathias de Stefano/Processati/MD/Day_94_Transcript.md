# Day 94 - Magic: The Unseen Creator

## Daily Practice Elements

**Vibration**: MEN  
**Statement**: "I am the expansion of the heart"  
**Chakra**: Heart Chakra  
**Law**: Law of Transmutation - The only eternal thing is transformation. Nothing ever stays still. Everything is in constant change. Even the void changes its perspective of the whole in relation with its modifications. For that, we can't live our lives based on the idea of eternity, but in the constant awareness of inevitable transformation. And first, we will never suffer crisis, for crisis are for those who search permanence and hate to change.

## Overview

Magic is not about supernatural powers or trickery—it is about being capable. The word "magician" comes from the European ma-hush, meaning "the one capable of doing something." True magic is unexplained science, the ability to see beyond the shapes of reality into the essence of creation. When you open your eyes, you see the created—the manifest reality around you. But where is the creator? The only way to find the creator is by closing your eyes and entering the darkness within, where imagination dwells. This is why, from the very beginning of humanity, the creator has been associated with night, with the moon and stars, with the unseen realm where all manifestation originates.

The path of the magician begins with facing your own darkness. To speak with the spirits of nature, you must first speak with the spirit of yourself. This requires descending into your own shadows, fears, and hidden demons. Once you accomplish this inner dialogue, you can listen to the spirits of everything around you. The darkness is not your enemy—it is the womb of creation itself. What religions have taught us to fear as evil is actually our own power to create freely. By closing our eyes and going within, we reconnect with the divine imagination that allows us to manifest our own reality.

Understanding magic requires understanding that demons were never inherently evil. They are projections we created in the fourth dimension from our own fears and polarities. During the Holocene period, as humans developed consciousness, we shaped beings in the spiritual realm based on our perception that some things were "good" and others "bad." A bear hunting at night was just a bear, but in our imagination, it became a demon. Through thousands of years of this projection, we populated the fourth dimension with creatures of our own making. The so-called evil never existed independently—it is only our projection born from fear of the night, fear of the unknown, fear of our own power.

## Core Teaching

### The Three Meanings of Magic

Magic in modern society is understood in three ways: as illusions and mind tricks that confuse our organized perception; as the fantasy magic of wizards and witches from stories like Harry Potter; and as al-Qimia—the Arabic word for chemistry, the science that ancient magicians practiced. True magic is unexplained science, all the knowledge that exists but that people cannot yet understand. The magician is capable of handling reality, science, music, philosophy—many things that others cannot comprehend. This means everyone is capable of something different, and in this way, we are all magicians with unique magic within us, waiting to be activated.

### Imagination: The Place Where the Creator Dwells

To understand magic, we must go to the unseen, the things we cannot see with our physical eyes. When you look at a pencil, the simple mind sees only a pencil. But a magician sees a tree that transformed itself and a rock that transformed itself—inside the pencil lives the information of a forest and a mountain. The magician sees beyond shapes, and to do this, you need imagination. Imagination exists within, in the darkness you find when you close your eyes. From the very beginning of humanity, our ancestors understood that when you open your eyes, you see the created, but the creator can only be found by closing your eyes and watching the unseen. The creator lives in darkness, in the imagination, in the mind. This is why the divine was connected with night, with the moon, with the stars—the realm where imagination connects with the divine.

### The Four Elements: Day and Night

During the day, the four elements—fire, water, earth, and air—were useful for daily creation. Fire was used by blacksmiths to create tools, water to clean and nourish plants, earth to harvest and grow food, and air was breathed constantly. But during the night, these same four elements stopped being merely useful and became the body of the divine. Water became the medium for creating medicine in ceremony; fire became the life of the spirit; air became the wind carrying the voices of trees; and earth became the womb of the Mother. At night, the four elements linked to divine potential, transforming and creating the beauty of the day's creation. Magicians learned to speak with the four elements, to listen and understand them, so they could take the divine essence and create tools and manifestations for daily life.

### Demons as Projections, Not Enemies

During the night, there were not only the four elements but also creatures like bears and wolves trying to hunt humans. These were dangerous animals, but just as the fire's spirit awakened at night, so did the spirit of the bear and wolf—and humans called these spirits "demons." Before humans, there were no demons in the fourth dimension as we know them today. During the Holocene period, we designed these creatures from our own perspective. Everything in nature has a spirit, a divine energy—neither good nor bad, but we divided them in our minds according to how they affected our lives. The evil we perceive in demons is only a projection from the last 10,000 years, created by people who were afraid of the night. When you take power away from this idea and recognize that darkness is also your creator, they stop being your enemies because they were only projecting the idea you held.

### Offerings: Collaboration with Darkness

Many people believe offerings are something bad or involve selling your soul, but an offering is simply like preparing a meal for a friend. It is sharing something you don't use that would be very useful for others. Your own waste, for example, is not good for you, but it becomes excellent fertilizer for plants. In nature, exchanging through offerings is natural. If you give something the plants need, the plants give you flowers and fruits. Similarly, working with the dark forces is about sharing energy and information. The dark ones are the creators who need energy to manifest, so you work together. If you're able to perceive higher dimensions, you'll see that dark and light are constantly working together—they are a team of creation. Only we humans in the third dimension separate everything and fail to understand how they work together.

### Responsibility and Freedom

To be a magician is to use your inner tools and inner power to create your own reality, but you can only achieve this by being responsible. You must recognize that you are the only one who can create—don't give your power to anyone outside, whether evil or good. We don't belong to anyone; we don't belong to God or darkness. We are creators and the created; we are the divine. Everything in the universe is connected by symbiosis—interaction and sharing. If we don't share with others, we cannot manifest our potential. We are a unique mechanism, each working in a different way, but each way creates everything because we are one. If we remain in the fight thinking there is someone good and someone bad, we will not transform anything; we will stay in the same circle, the same process. Everything you think and speak is created by vibration in the universe. If you think and talk about enemies, all you will create for your life will be enemies.

## Practice

The meditation today takes you deep into the heart of the Earth to discover the magic within yourself and to collaborate with the darkness as the creative force.

**Preparation**: Sit comfortably. Begin to move your shoulders in circles to relax the weight of your body. Let all the weight fall down, focus only on your breathing. Sit deeper and deeper. Perceive the light around your body, going to your skin, penetrating inside to your bones, muscles, and organs, allowing you to feel how you shine from within and outside.

**Descent of the I Am**: Recognize yourself as the light of the I Am, of the higher self that descends toward you. Feel the light descend through your crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacrum, root, knees, and ankles. You are the spirit living in matter, and you manifest your intention: "I desire to live the magic."

**Journey to the Core**: Descend from your feet to the ground, through the roots and stones and rocks. Exit from the crust of the world, heading toward the nucleus through the magma, feeling its heat and pressure. Turn faster until you reach the core made of iron, the heart and darkness of Earth.

**Becoming the Four Elements**: Feel the pressure of the Earth in your field—the pressure of the magma and its fire, the pressure of the oceans, the pressure of the atmosphere. Perceive this strength of earth, of iron, water, and air. Feel the truth and how you become the four elements. You are the earth, you are fire, you are water, you are air, and all of them pulse from the center, from the heart.

**Vibration**: From the heart center, vibrate the sound **MEN** repeatedly, feeling the expansion of the heart.

**Statement**: Repeat: "I am the expansion of the heart. I am the expansion of the heart. I am the expansion of the heart."

**Return**: Slowly bring your awareness back through the layers of Earth, rising through the magma, the crust, and back into your body. Take a deep breath. Open your eyes when ready.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Tonight, before going to sleep, close your eyes and spend five minutes in complete darkness. Don't try to see anything; simply rest in the unseen. Ask yourself: "What can I create that I have not yet imagined?" Allow ideas, images, or feelings to arise without judgment. This is your connection to the creator within, to your own magic. Write down any images or ideas that come to you, knowing they are seeds of manifestation.

### Applying the Wisdom

Notice throughout your day when you are looking at the created (the manifest reality around you) versus accessing the creator (your inner imagination). When you face a problem, close your eyes for a moment and ask your imagination to show you a new way, a magical solution beyond the obvious. Practice seeing beyond the surface of objects—look at a tree and see the forest it came from, the soil that nourished it, the sunlight that powered it. This is training yourself to see as a magician sees: beyond shapes, into essence.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the true definition of magic?**  
A: Magic is the capacity to do something—ma-hush in ancient European languages. It is unexplained science, the ability to handle reality, to see beyond the shapes of things into their essence. Everyone has unique magic within because everyone is capable of something different that others cannot do.

**Q: Why is darkness associated with the creator?**  
A: Because when you open your eyes, you see only the created—the manifest reality. To find the creator, you must close your eyes and enter the darkness within, where imagination dwells. From the very beginning of humanity, our ancestors understood that the creator lives in the unseen, in the night, in the realm of imagination and mind.

**Q: Are demons real, and why should we not fear them?**  
A: Demons are projections we created in the fourth dimension from our own fears and polarities. Before the Holocene period (last 12,000 years), they did not exist as we know them today. We shaped them based on dividing nature into "good" and "bad" according to how things affected us. When you take power from the idea that they are enemies and recognize darkness as also your creator, they stop fighting you because they were only reflecting your own projection.

**Q: What is an offering, and how does it work with darkness?**  
A: An offering is like preparing a meal for a friend—sharing something you don't use that would be useful for others. In nature, this is natural exchange: your waste fertilizes plants, which give you flowers. Working with the dark forces is about sharing energy and information. The dark ones are creators who need energy to manifest, so you work together in collaboration, not conflict. This is how nature operates—through symbiosis and exchange.

**Q: How did religions turn darkness into something to fear?**  
A: Religions wanted to control people's power to be free. By closing your eyes and going into your own darkness, you find the tools to be your own creator, which makes you free. So religions created an enemy in the darkness, saying if you go there you will go to hell. This made people afraid to access their own creative power. But actually, religions were born because many people were irresponsible and wanted a god outside to take care of their problems, so they gave their power away.

**Q: How can I discover the magic within myself?**  
A: Face your own darkness—your own fears, shadows, and hidden demons. This is the first step. Once you speak with the spirit of yourself, you can listen to the spirits of nature around you. Use your imagination by closing your eyes and accessing the unseen. Recognize that you are the creator and the created, and take responsibility for your own reality. Your inner tools will reveal themselves when you stop protecting yourself from the outside and start using your potential to activate your creation.

**Q: What does it mean that "the only eternal thing is transformation"?**  
A: Nothing stays still; everything is in constant change, even the void. We cannot live based on the idea of eternity but must live in constant awareness of inevitable transformation. When we accept this, we never suffer crisis, because crisis comes only to those who search for permanence and hate to change. Transformation is the law of the universe, and embracing it allows us to flow with creation rather than resist it.

**Q: Why do you say we should not fight against darkness or evil?**  
A: Because when you fight, you give strength to what you oppose. If we stay in the mindset that there is good versus bad, we remain in the same cycle without transformation. Everything in the universe is one, connected by symbiosis. Dark and light work together constantly in higher dimensions—they are a team of creation. Only we humans in the third dimension separate everything. When you recognize that darkness is not your enemy but part of creation, you stop creating enemies in your reality. What you think and speak about is what you create through vibration.
