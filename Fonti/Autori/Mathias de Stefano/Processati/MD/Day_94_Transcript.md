## Introduction

Hi everyone. Are you? Morning , Good afternoon , Good evening. I am feeling better and kind of getting out of the fever mood.

So I 'm better.

So besides all this thing of fever and so on , the coaching sometimes , I 've been speaking today with some people and they told me that maybe it could be some sports , I do n't know if you say like that in English , like this fungus that are in the air and humid places , that sometimes people had this problems with breathing when they come to pure minutes or tombs or places like that and I am going every day.

So basically , it can also be that.

So I will let you know when I exactly know if it is because of that.

So the topic for today is related with magic and I think there is a lot of things to speak about it to talk about magic , but I will try to make a summary because I wrote to many things today in the block.

So wherever I want to check it , you have everything in the block.

So first of all , try to understand what is magic for our for our current society. From the point of view of static , the people that does n't believe it anything. Basically for the society that is more scientific , magic would be the mind-tricks like illusions. The illusions are very tricky for our mind because the mind basically is divided in different informations like very organized.

So when someone comes and switched them and mixed those folders of information that we have inside , the brain does n't have the perception , the previous idea of what it is happening , what is happening.

So that is why we have illusions.

So it is very easy to make the mind believe in things because of that.

So basically we call them like tricks of illusion.

So the first thing that comes to us when we think about magic , tricks of illusion.

So in the other hand , we can relate magic with all these people that all these stories of the magicians and the witches and to make a pure things and like Harry Potter and so on. That 's the other kind of magic.

So in ancient times what we call magic was not about to make a pure things and to do all the Harry Potter things but it was about al-Qimia and al-Qimia comes from the out-up word that means the chemistry.

So chemistry physics was the way in which these people , the magicians , used to work with , they used science.

So for the point of view of the ancestral materials , magic would be unexplained science.

So it 's all the science that people have no idea that existed.

So they call it magic. But the concept of magic and magician comes from way before that and it is in the European languages where they would say ma-hush , ma-hush means that one that is capable to do something. Basically in those times we would say that these people were the capable to do many things that others could not understand. They knew how to handle the reality , how to handle science , music , philosophy , many things.

So they were capable to do a lot of things.

So that 's what in the European languages we would say ma-hush , the origin of the word magic and magician. Everything that we relate with magic , not about to do magical things that we can not understand , basically to make magic is to be capable to do something.

So basically this means that everyone is capable of something different. We all can do something that others can not.

So in such a way we are all magicians , in such a way we all have magic within. But we do n't know how to activate it , we do n't know how to do it.

So the way in which you have in which you can go and look for that big is if you go with them to look for your tools , the tools that you have within. How can I look for the tools to understand the magic that I have within? First of all we have to understand the first thing that I said about magic magic is about the unseen , the things that you can not see. Because the reality you can see it , you can perceive it , you can watch it.

So that 's the reality that 's the thing.

So if I put here a pencil the simple mind will say this is a pencil. What is this? A pencil? But a magician would say that this is a tree that transform itself and the rock that transforms itself.

So inside pencil I have the information of a forest and the information of a mountain. This is much more than just a pencil. It has a lot of information within.

So the magician is the one able to see beyond the shapes and to do that , you need imagination. And imagination is within. You have to go to the darkness within , to close your eyes and to picture all the ideas that you have here. We have to go to the very beginning of our humanity to understand why the imagination is the key to understand beyond the matter.

And basically is because when you open your eyes and you see around you see the created , you see the things that are created that are already there. If all the created things are there outside when I look at them , so where is the creator? The only way I can find the creator is by closing my eyes and watching the unseen. This is why from the very beginning of humanity and all religions after that.

When they were sitting in front of a fire and they would start to think about as the creator , they recognized that the only way someone can create is from the ideas , from the mind.

So imagination is a way where is a way where is the place where you can create , then you open your eyes and you manifest the created outside.

So this is the beginning of the idea that the universe , the creator , is mind , is imagination. And from this kind of thing , another idea that if the world that I can see , which is because of the light of the sun , is out there.

## Guided Meditation

So the creator is within the imagination. This means that the creator lives in the darkness , because I can only connect the darkness when I close my eyes and go deep within myself.

So the creator must be at night in the dark , the unseen.

So this is how they started to understand that the creator is in the moon. The creator is in the Milky Way , in the stars.

So under the stars and under the moon , you can be connected with imagination , with the divine. During the night , during the fires.

So they created these fires and they dance around and they celebrate on the stars and the moon , the connection of the creator. When they realized that during the night , they was able to connect with the divine.

So they also recognized that during the day , they created the creation itself was useful for the daily things. During the daily things , you have the four elements , so the fire was used for the blacksmith to create tools. The water was used to clean also to watch the plants. The earth was used to to put the to harvest the soul and the air was there being breached.

So you were feeling the air is where it was around everywhere. During the night , the four elements stopped being useful for the creation and became the body of the divine because you can not see them , but you start to feel them.

So the water becomes the way in which you can create the medicine. In the ceremony , the fire becomes the life of the spirit. The air is the wind , the voices of the trees and the ground , the earth is the womb of the mother.

So during the night , the four elements are linked , it 's divine potential. This projected the idea that during the night , the four elements , the body of the goddess , the god , the creator , transforming and creating the beauty of the day , creation itself.

So this is how in the same way women and men , they were magicians. They started to talk with the four elements to try to listen to them , to understand them , so they could take the divine from them and be able to create , to manifest from their divinity.

So they could have tools and things for the day life.

So what the magicians used to do with their students was to teach them how to become the elements , how to become the elements of the name , to take the divine of those elements of the nature. And from there , connected with the divine , so with the imagination , with the mind , they were able to create to manifest realities.

So there 's another thing that happened. In the night , there was not only the four elements. There were also all these creatures that were trying to kill us to eat us like bears , wolves. They were trying to hunt us.

So they were bad for humans. But remember this , if during the day the fire was useful to create tools and during the night , the spirit of the fire , a weight , and it was alive , like someone , like someone in a life.

So during the day , the bear , the wolf , would be an animal , but during the night , they would be demons. They would awake their inner divinity. Also humans , during the day , there were normal people and during the night , they became magicians. In the last thousands of years , the period of history that we called the Holosim during the appearance of humans and the creation of humans , as we know today , the image of demons were created in the fourth dimension.

Before humans , there is no demons in the fourth dimension as we feel now. During all period of time , what we have done was to shape those beings from our point of view , from our perspective.

So with the imagination , we designed in the fourth dimension these creatures that we call demons. But before it did n't exist.

So all this history , what we have done was to create the idea of evil from beings in nature that they were just normal. They were the spirits of the rose , the spirit of the tree , the spirit of an animal. They were not good or bad , but we divided in our brain in good and bad according to how they affected us in our life.

So basically , all the things that exist in the reality has a spirit.

So it has a divine energy.

So there is a tree in the day , during the day , there is a tree , but during the night , the tree has a spirit and it 's during the night where the magician is able to put it tree. And that 's how we created all this magical stories. Because they were able to speak with the spirit of the trees. Magicians are the ones with the ability , the capacity to feel beyond the shapes.

Remember , this is related with night because it 's not about to see things , it 's about to close your eyes , go with them and feel things.

So now we have this idea , let 's try to go and understand how a magician becomes a magician. The magicians could understand that in order to speak with the creators , we had to go to the night to the shadows because otherwise we are speaking with the created but not the creators.

So to speak with the spirit of the creators , we go within during the night.

Okay , so one of the main things that the magicians has to do was to go into the darkness , going through the fear , transcluding the fear , not to understand that there is nothing to be afraid of.

So you have to show yourself that you were not afraid of the spirits of the night , so you can speak with them.

So which spirit is the first one that you have to speak with in order to be able to speak with the other spirits in the forest in the reality?

So the only way you can speak with the nature and the spirits that are around you is if you go within , towards your own self , the spirit of your own self is the first one you have to talk to. In order to reach that spirit , you must face your own darkness , your own fears , your own shadows , your own demons , all those that you kept inside your body , hidden. And there you can go through all of them and face your spirit. And once you accomplish to speak with your spirit to be with your spirit , then you can start to listen to the spirit of nature.

Everyone around you.

So this is why once I face the darkness that I have inside , I am able to transform myself.

So this will tell you that also , if you get to the darkness and you know how to handle the darkness , you will be able also to transform the reality. Everything. Because they are the creators. Darkness is this spirit that creates nature.

So if I want to change nature , whom I am supposed to be free with. Darkness is the only one that creates nature. This is why magicians use to do the ceremonies and magic , like many things with the darkness.

So they could transform the reality. Let 's go to the beginning.

So understand why demons are that and why I have to protect myself from demons.

So first of all , we have to understand that in nature , this nothing evil , in nature , everything is doing what they are supposed to.

So there 's nothing evil in nature. They are just working. That 's it. Surviving , that 's it.

But remember that , but remember that the ones that create are the spirits of nature and the spirits of nature are connected to the mind , to other dimension , not the real one , not this one.

So whatever you feel , whatever you with your mind , you will be projecting it into the fourth dimension , which is more subtle. And it 's so subtle , the fourth dimension , that everything that you think that you create in your mind , it 's molded in the spiritual world of the fourth dimension.

So to understand how this demons appears , remember there 's no evil in nature. They are doing their own things.

So basically during the whole scene , in the last 12,000 years , approximately , the humans have been designing this reality in a huge polarity , like dividing everything in good and bad.

So this creates a polarity in our reality that makes us believe that we are the good ones.

So therefore , there are bad ones.

So what we have been doing through thousands of years , was to design , in the fourth dimension , a lot of beings that are occupying the place of that polarity , if we think we are the good ones , so they should be the bad ones.

So this is why we have created through thousands of years these beings , these creatures in the fourth dimension.

So all the demons , all the creatures , they were not bad by nature. He created us the bad ones. But before all this happened , basically they were just beings creating things. We used to all the dark ones , the creatures of nature , the creatures of reality.

This is why also Lucifer , for example , that name comes from the Latin word , Lucas Vermosos , that means the brighter light , the most beautiful light ever. That 's his name.

So basically , it 's the light that allowed the universe to create beauty. That 's what it means. It 's the light that allows to create beauty.

So all the things that we have today , they are like a chaos of information that is not how it was before , it 's not how we before.

The reason why we have this idea of the evil being the Lucifer and all these demons and so on , and they trying to harness this conflict began , began cut of religion , trying to control the power of people.

Remember that the power that you have within , by closing your eyes in your darkness , is the power that allows you to be the creator of your reality.

So if you become your creator , you are free. Easy.

So you start to be free.

So basically , religions do n't want for you to be free.

So this is why they and enemy that is in the darkness , where you will find the tools to be free.

Okay?

So they started to create all this , but it 's not because of religion. It was religions were born just because a lot of people were so irresponsible that they , that they had not will to face their own darkness.

So they were ready to have a god in the outside to take care of all their problems.

Okay?

So it 's not about someone trying to control us , it 's about us being so irresponsible that we gave the powers to others so they can fight about if we are doing good or bad. It 's just that. In our civilization , we started to create started to create this concept of the evil. And basically what the regime was trying to do was to take the power from the power from the darkness.

So through all the history , basically , they were saying , if you go to the dark , you will go to hell.

Okay? Basically , the magicians , were the ones able to control the darkness because they were the spirits of creation.

So basically , the magicians knew how to handle the darkness to be free and to manifest to create.

So by religion , they said , no , that 's bad. You have to follow one god and that one god have to protect you , we 'll protect you from the darkness and do n't go to the darkness because otherwise you will go to hell.

So everyone was so afraid of going to the darkness that they would even fight all the darkness inside and not understand the possibility that you have to create yourself if you go inside to your darkness.

So they started to leave in separation and by law of polarity , they created an enemy outside in the darkness.

So we started to create them as our enemies , the evil ones. But the evil ones never existed really. It 's only a projection from the last 10,000 years from a group of people that were a threat of night and that 's it.

So it 's horrible that I love about this but it 's just that even for today , the people in in the path of spirituality , a lot of people still are coming to this planet to fight against the darkness and some evil enemy and you know like we believe we are warriors of light and so on. And yeah , of course you ca n't do it because now it 's our reality but but it 's all just a perception that was born 10,000 years ago but by just being afraid of a tree during the night.

So it 's important to talk about all this because during this whole month we will face darkness and the last thing I want you to believe is that we are trying to connect with the evil.

Okay? No , because the evil does n't exist really if you take the power of the evil. If you you 're just creating the evil because you believe it exists but when you take the power to it and you say , oh the darkness is my creator also with the light and darkness they create myself.

So basically they 're both my creators in different missions.

So when I recognize that darkness is not the king 's me they will be only king 's me because if I create the idea that they are against me they will be just easy like that.

So all of us who have been fighting against the darkness we fight against them because we created the idea that they are the enemies.

So when you take away this idea they are not fighting anymore because they are only projecting the idea that you have.

So this is why the magicians they were using darkness to create. That 's why they were able to manifest.

So if we are here working for the consciousness for a new society and new humanity one of the main things that we have to understand is that the image of the devil , the Lucifer and all these demons were created after the fall of the Roman Empire. The 500 years after Jesus Christ in the middle ages the people created this idea of the demons.

So the kids would n't leave the villages to the forest because someone can rape them. It was an idea to protect the population. It was an idea to create balance between the people of Europe and the Middle Ages.

So it 's all stories. Basically they are stories. In the fourth dimension we have the spirits of the nature.

So when we say but how can we explain the possessions that people are leaving and so on? All these demons.

So this this this things is basically easy to explain with a rat. For example you have a rat in your house. And the rat usually steals food.

So the rat comes , steals food and leave. And in the fourth dimension you have the spirit of the rat that is stealing energy from your house. The same thing.

So if I instead of killing them I always give something to eat the rat but in the garden outside my house. The rat will grow it that as an offer and the rat will leave.

So in the fourth dimension if I leave also something energetic.

So the rat also in the fourth dimension will take that and leave. But if I say the rat is my enemy. I am trying to kill the rat and I am trying to follow the rat and trying to kill it.

So the rat will become also my enemy. And in the fourth dimension that rat will also become my enemy.

So basically it 's about what is the size of the rat. Yeah so there are rats like this and rat there and big.

So basically that 's the compression of why there are very big rats that can come and try to eat your energy. But it 's just nature in the fourth dimension.

So basically talking about offers , talking about what it is to make an offering. A lot of us has this idea that offering is something bad or you telling yourself or whatever. But offering is like preparing a meal for a friend. Offering is to as I was explained right now in a very not very romantic way.

Imagine that you have something that you do n't use but that thing that you do n't use is will be very useful for other ones.

So for example , your own shit. You have your own shit that you do n't use that is not good for you. And so you have a lot of flowers plants outside.

So you give that shit to the plants and for the shit for the plants , your own poo will be very very good. It 's like an offer. It 's everything for our plant.

So then the flowers will give you smell. The flowers will give you fruits , whatever.

So in nature exchanging by offering is natural. We have put a concept of offering to think that that is religious or whatever.

So but it 's not like that. It 's basically about sharing. It 's basically about knowing that something and buy that you will receive something. As I said , it 's basically offering and working with the darkness is basically to share energy , to share information , is like nature itself.

Would you give something that the plants need that plants will give you fruit?

So you 're a changing energy. And if the dark ones were the ones creating the reality , so you are exchanging also and they give you a result. It 's exactly the same. But it 's our culture has thought that created this idea that the evil are trying to kill us.

Basically the dark ones are the creatures. They need energy to create to manifest.

So we work together. If you are able sometimes to go to the fourth to the fifth dimension , you will see that dark and light , they 're working constantly together. They are constantly working. They are a team of creation.

And we , in third dimension as humans , we are the only ones that usually separate everything and we do n't understand how it works together. It 's like the easy way to understand this is to picture that humans usually believe we are the heart. This is the heart. We are the heart and light it hard , whatever.

And you may think that the intestines are horrible. They are the dirty ones. The intestines are very dark. All the shit is there.

So now we only the heart.

So we do n't want anything with the intestines. But what a surprise heart. When the heart recognize that the blood that goes through it is created by the intestines. The intestines are the only ones that are the organs absorb in the nutrients and creating the blood , creating all the things that we need.

So without the intestines hard , can not work.

Okay?

So that 's it. That 's easy. This is how it works. You can get rid of the intestines.

Otherwise you die because you do n't have blood. That 's explanation of how we think we are from the heart in the light and the intestines are the bad ones because they are dark and basically they are creating the blood that we have.

So just to close the idea and of course I think this is very important to be spoken.

So I spoke too much.

Sorry , but anyway , this is free.

So I do n't whatever I want. I feel free.

So the idea would be that we have to start by being responsible of our own creation. Everything that exists is created by us.

So we have to be responsible of our own reality , our own creation. And to be a magician is to use your inner tools , your inner power in order to create that reality. But you can only achieve that by being responsible and to recognize the Jew are the only one that can create not even the power that you have within to someone outside , even evil or good.

So as I said , we do n't belong to anyone. We do n't belong to God. We do n't belong to the darkness. We are creators and the created.

We are the divine.

So we are the only ones capable to transform the ways in which we connect with that reality. Everything that you are universe is connected by symbiosis and symbiosis is to interact to share.

So if we do n't share with the others , we are not going to be able to manifest our potential.

So a unique mechanism and each one is working in a different way , but each way is the one that creates everything. Because we are one and that 's it. You can not take anyone out of the system , we are one.

So just to remind you , if we are still in the fight thinking that there is someone good and someone bad , we are not going to transform anything.

We are going to be constantly in the same circle , same process.

So remember that everything that you and think is created by vibration in the universe. If you think and talk about enemies , all you are going to create for your life will be enemies. And this is the most important say for an magician. What I think what I say is what I create , which you may know in ancient language , the sentence as Aba Kamara.

## Daily Practice Elements

The vibration is me. The statement for today is I am hard expansion. The code for today is in this law reminds us that the only eternal thing is transformation. Nothing ever stays still.

Everything is in constant change. Even the void changes it 's perspective of the whole in relation with its modifications. For that , we ca n't leave our lives based on the idea of eternity , but in the constant awareness of inevitable transformation. And first , we will never suffer crisis.

For crisis are for those who search permanent and hunt at that to change this. We sit comfortable , I begin to move my shoulders and circles. I relax the weight of the body , focus only in my breathing. I sit in the deep and deeper.

## Energy Work

I perceive the light around my body , going to my skin , penetrating inside to my bones , muscles , organs , allowing me to feel how I shine from within and outside. Ok! I recognise myself As the light of the I am , of the higher self that goes down towards me. I descend through my crown , their eye , throat , heart , flex , scrum , root , root , knees , and ankles.

I am the speech living the matter and I manifest my intention. I desire to leave the magic , I desire to leave magic. I descend from my feet to the ground , roots , and stones , the rocks. Going out from the crust of the world , heading towards the nucleus through the magma , feeling its heat and pressure.

As turn faster until you reach the core , made of iron , the heart , and darkness of earth. I feel the pressure of the earth on my field of pressure of the magma and its higher. I feel the pressure of the oceans , I feel the pressure of the atmosphere. I perceive this strength of earth , of iron , water , and air.

I can feel the truth and how I become the four elements. I am the earth , I am fire , I am water , I am air , and all of them pulse from the center , from the heart. I feel the pressure of the oceans , I feel the pressure of the atmosphere. I am the expansion of the heart , I am the expansion of the heart.

I am the expansion of the heart. I am the fire , I am the fire. I am water. I am the fire.

I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire.

I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire.

I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire.

I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire.

I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire.

I am the fire. I am the fire. I am the fire.
