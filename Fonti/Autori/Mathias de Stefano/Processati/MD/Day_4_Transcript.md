## Core Teaching

### The Portal of Heart and Energy Transformation

The heart chakra serves as the portal for love, balance, and emotional transformation. Today’s teaching highlights the importance of acknowledging and integrating all emotions, including darkness and discomfort, as part of the self. By observing and understanding these energies, participants can transform and expand through love.

### Perception, Darkness, and Integration

The process of alignment may bring up feelings of discomfort, darkness, or heaviness. These are projections of inner energies being released and transformed. The teaching encourages participants to observe, contemplate, and integrate these aspects rather than reject them, understanding that nothing outside can harm unless allowed.

### Body Awareness and Preparation

Participants are guided to find a comfortable position, keep the spine straight, and honor the body through touch and massage. Breathing exercises and attention to sensations facilitate relaxation and readiness for meditation, allowing the body to download and integrate higher vibrations.

2. Contemplate the connection between these spheres and your heart chakra.
3. Bring the spheres into the core of your heart, nourishing it with their energy.
4. Visualize the light of your higher self descending through the crown, third eye, and throat to the heart.
5. Observe the light dissolving the spheres, feeding the seed within your heart.
