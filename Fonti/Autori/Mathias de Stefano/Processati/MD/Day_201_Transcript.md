## Introduction

Hi everyone. Odin , good afternoon , good evening. Welcome all of you to the physical wake of the month of Aquarium. I remind you to all the new people that start to follow this connection every day that we are not following the calendar of the tropical or central calendar.

We are following the Atlanta tradition of 12 months of 30 days each starting in the moment of the rising of the star series in the horizon , which last year 2020 was August 4th in the morning. And also for the new people , I remind you that we have been working with astrology in this month , but you must know that every concept that we are speaking every day , most of it I already take it as a given , because it has been like 200 days doing this transition. And I have been working with the rest of the world for the past missions , every day.

## Q&A

So most of the topics that maybe some people are asking or pointing at , I already has spoken about it.

So sometimes I will repeat some things , but usually I want to repeat many of the main concepts that we are already spoken. Which applications may suggest you changes the music , but it looks better way then it shows the other 200 videos.

Another thing for the new ones that are following this , well , first thank you all for joining us in this new days , in these new transmissions. And maybe , most of you are asking if it 's necessary to see all the rest that all the other videos , so you can catch up with us.

So , no , there 's no need to see all the rest in order to catch up , catch us up. You can start just from this video on to join our elements. There 's no problem that. But I would recommend to go and look into the other videos because this August 2021 , we will do work all together.

So , it 's necessary for that work to kind of have the whole information that we are working with.

So , I would ask for all those people and thank all those all these people that are helping me to inform the others , the new ones , to let them know that this information. There is no need to do all the rest in order to catch us up in these elements. You can do it , no problem. But it is better for the task in August to have done the whole thing before.

So , thank you very much for everybody.

So , let 's begin with the information for this week. This next 10 days of this physical week of cap of Aquarium , we will be working with the main stars and planets of our solar system , which are the celestial objects that affect us the most in a physical way.

So , we will speak about all of them and before we begin with the topic for today , which is Trans , the planet Trans , we will begin with explanation of what is a planet and why they can affect us. Let 's begin with what is a planet. The origin of the word planet comes from planet Less , which comes from the Greek planar that means the ones that walk without any goal , not destiny , the dust nowhere it goes. And Less , that means the subject , the person that does an action.

So , this is the person that does an action and this is the action.

So , both together creates the person that does it , which in English I have no idea how to say it. Wondering , perfect. But that would be wonder , but errant is the best one. Because it 's the same errant.

So , means wondered.

So , errant is the English word that comes from the Latin and wondered it comes from the Nordic.

Okay , but is the same origin , is the same word.

So , errant means the one that does nowhere it goes.

So , the translation is the one that makes a mistake. Yes , I mean , it 's because it does no where it goes , basically.

So , that 's that 's a meaning.

So , it 's not describing exactly the one that is looking for something , but it 's describing the one that does n't know where it 's looking for.

Okay , that 's the description in English.

So , errant comes from era that means to wonder to go around to make a mistake not knowing where it goes.

Okay , background , it says , background.

So , , and then we have end , that is the origin of end entity , that means being.

Okay , this means being.

So , end. This is bug , bug , bone , I do n't know how to scroll it. By a bone?

Okay. I was just playing something that is only useful in Spanish.

So , it does n't matter in English. It 's about languages that in English you do n't have , which is this feminine and masculine in the end of the word.

So , what is the planet? The planet for the Greek people was this stars that were moving in the sky. In the first moment in the history , there were not ideas of there is another world outside. There 's no worlds in the sky.

There 's only stars like lights in the sky.

So , because of this , the people who this stars that were moving , the errant stars , the ones that are not finding its place that are walking through the stars. Because of this , they call it the errant stars , the wondering stars.

So , they had no idea that they were worlds. They just thought that were planets. Stars that were moving without a place.

Okay. And because of this , they also imagined that they were the gods walking in the sky.

So , so that 's why they started to name them as gods with the name of the gods. But there was only a few , were able to be seen that until Saturn. The other ones were not able to be seen just normally.

So , this is why the last planets after Saturn were known recently , recently , 18th century in the 19th century and the last one , the 20th century.

So , the people that discovered them , even if they were mathematicians or astrophysics , whatever , astronomers or those kind of people , they kept calling them as gods , because they wanted to keep the tradition of naming the things that are in this sky like the ancient wood called them.

Okay.

So , now we know what is the planet. Let 's try to remember how a planet takes for.

So , important thing that maybe not all the people know , and I guess it 's important to know , which is that this here , the sun , is a star. It seems silly , but it 's a star. And all the stars that are in the galaxy are not suns , are stars. The only star called named Sun is ours.

So , we live in the solar system , because this system is owned by the star named Sun.

Okay. If we were in the star of our tours , we would call the system our tour of system. If we are in serious , we would call it serious system. But because we are in the star named Sun , we are in the solar system , because the name of the star is solid , solid.

So , I guess it 's important to know , and maybe many people do n't have the idea of this. Do you remember where is our star named Sun? It is in the one of the arms of the galaxy , that is called the arm of Orion , and we are inside the galaxy of the Milky Way.

So , some people are asking if there is the Sun in the center of the galaxy. No , there is no Sun in the center of the galaxy. There are thousands of Suns in the center of the galaxy , and maybe we call it the Sun of the galaxy of the center , because we can see each from our distance like one light or whatever , but it 's only , but it 's thousands of them all together. And of course , if there is the Sun , it would n't be called Sun , because Sun is the name of our star.

So , 4,000 billions , I do n't know the name in English , but 4,500 thousands of millions of years , let 's say this way , the Sun exploded. And when you 've exploded , it makes that all these minerals and materials went away like gas and dust all around the system , like expanded. But these particles started to heat one another so fast that they started to create magnetism.

So , by this explosion and the fast movement of these particles , they started to create this magnetism in the collapse in the tune of them.

So , they started to create like irons.

So , this magnets that started to put the irons all together , created the basis of the planets.

So , the particles that were floating around in this dust cloud of dust , were heating these rocks with magnetism , and they would start to compact one another , creating rocks.

So , they started to create much , much , much more bigger structures with magnetism , creating planets.

So , of course , as close as you are from the Sun , the stronger is the magnetism.

So , well , not the magnetism , the gravity.

So , that 's why all the gas and the particles were compact even more.

So , that 's why these four first planets were the ones able to compact this energy , this these particles. And that 's why we started to it started to form mercury that 's put it here. Mercury Venus Earth on Mars. Here in the middle there was another one that was broken , creating the ring of asteroids , the belt , the belt of asteroids.

So , all around here there is no much strength of the gravity of the Sun.

So , all the gas does n't need to and the dust does n't need to compact much.

So , they create this kind of planets with no much , with a lot of gravity , but not not need to be completed.

So , they create it creates the planets made of metal , metal of gas.

So , in this territory we have Jupiter Saturn , Trans , Neptune , and here in the last one which is the rock Pluto. And around all this area we have a cloud of gas and dust named the cloud of ore.

So , when the Sun exploded all this rocks goes away , goes out and then by the gravity and the weight that this Sun has they all come back again , but in a way of the spiral , the weight they fall down is because the Sun has so much weight that it curves the space time.

So , all the things by gravity fall in down to the Sun moves like in a spiral , like falling down , like falling down into a hole.

So , think about this that the Sun is so much weight that if you put it in a terrain , the terrain will go down.

So , imagine picture that the Sun is in a hole and all the other rocks , the planets are spinning around and falling down to that rock. It will take millions of years to do that , but they will eventually fall down into the Sun.

So , the reason why I explained this weight is because we have to understand that everyone is pulled by the planets. Everyone is pushed by the gravity of the Sun and the other planets. We are pulled towards the Sun , our energy is constantly being pulled towards the Sun , but also the other planets move our gravity.

So , that 's why when for example , the Earth is falling down towards the Sun , but Jupiter comes behind the Earth is doing this , but then it 's pulled a little bit to Jupiter and then go back. You have to image , okay? It 's not exactly like this , but just to have that whole planet 's in orbit , the pushing of all the gravity around. Just to make a comparison to understand how they move in this space , have you seen the birds when they are flying?

Usually they take this shape , so when they fly , you have one bird here in front , open in the path , and the other , the others like this. This is because the one in the front is doing all this train to move the air around.

So , the air is here , and this one is making a lot of train to open the path of the air , helping the others to follow him to go faster , okay? But each one that is in front will help the other one and the other one.

So , this is like a chain that is moving the space , pushing and allowing the others to move in this environment , okay?

So , each one of these birds needs the other one in order to move better , something like this , okay? Just kind of a comparison to understand.

So , now think of the planets like this birds that are moving towards the sun , and when they move , they push the air like the birds , they push the air , helping the others to fly faster or pushing the others , and they have conflicts , okay?

So , this is how we can relate , even if I am explaining it with air , and in the space is gravity , but kind of like it does n't matter the distance between the birds , they will help each other to move better or to have problems when they move , okay? That would be that would be the concept of how the planets affect each other. This makes that the movement of the planets helps or not in our process of evolution.

So , this position here helps me to understand something and how the planets affect me. This bird here has to make a lot of strength because it is the one opening the air , so we can fly.

So , the next ones here will help because they will have to do some strength too , because they are in front , but then the other ones will be able to do less work , and the other ones will just go flowing , and the other ones wo n't do anything , just line , nothing. Hmm?

So , this means that the one that is in front , we have much more effect , and we 'll feel what is happening , we 'll feel it much more stronger than the other ones behind.

So , as farther you are from the beginning of the line , the less you will feel the pressure. In this movement of gravity , we can say that this bird here is the sun , and then we have the first planets here and the earth around here with Mars , and then we have here Jupiter , Saturn , and Neptune , Trans , and then a little bit here behind , which is Pluto , very in the back.

So , as farther we go , the less pressure will be felt , and what is the point of this that as farther it is the planet for me , the less I will perceive it , it will be much more subtle. The first one that affects us a lot is the moon , our natural satellite , because the moon is moving the waters , the real waters , the types of the ocean are because of the moon , without the moon , we would n't have tides , no waves in the sea. Basically , the moon is the one that is much more harder for us because it moves our world , our physical world , by its gravity , but then we have the other one closer we have Venus , then Mars , the effects a lot , then we have Mercury , the Sun , and then much more farther in time is Jupiter , and of course Saturn is like in the past is way behind , and of course that the planets that you can not see naturally like Trans , Neptune , Pluto , are so far that you have to make a lot of strength to feel it , to perceive it. There is so far away that the connection is so subtle , the gravity is so subtle , then it 's impossible to just feel it.

You have to go deep within in order to perceive those planets.

So , of course that all this explanation is just to help you understand how this planets will affect us and how Trans is going to affect us. For those who asked me about the moon being a natural or a artificial satellite , if you ask me , I will say is natural , is natural satellite others. Did you get it? I hope so.

Of course that always the first day is a bit longer because as always I want to explain the context of the topics that we are going to explain in the week. Let 's do this horrible human.

So , this are the three bodies , the three bodies. The spiritual in the center , the soul around and the physical in the outer.

So , I was explaining a bit of why we are able to leave in this planet because we are adopted to the pressure of this planet.

So , we have gravity , we are really explaining gravity , but now the pressure of the planet. The pressure of the planet is the pressure of the atmospheres that a planet has. Atmosphere means the steam spheres , that 's the that 's the translation of atmospheres. Atmosphere is the steam layers that cover a planet , but not just cover that goes towards the planet.

So , it 's very heavy.

So , the weight of this atmospheres is the weight of this atmosphere is the one that puts pressure on our bodies.

So , it 's so much weight that we in this world had to be adopted to that pressure in the environment. This is why our body has blood pressure , arterial pressure , all these pressures from inside are the ones that goes against the pressure from the outside.

So , we can move in the environment.

So , it 's so heavy. The pressure outside is so heavy towards the body that the bodies create another kind of pressure to be able to survive in the environment.

So , these pressures of the atmospheres are the ones that creates the weather , the low pressure , the high pressure are the ones that creates the storms , the lining , the rain or the clear skies is because of that pressure of the of the steam and the vapor that are floating in the plant.

So , we have this inner pressure in order to survive in the pressure of the plant.

Something that is really incredible about this is that the thing that that sets much more pressure to us is the sky. We think that the sky is like something that that we expand in the sky and the air is floating in the soil. But no , it 's totally the opposite. The sky is pressing us to the ground.

And the reason why we feel like we are open in the sky is because of the inner pressure , not the outer. The outer is trying to kill us pressing us towards the ground. It 's totally the opposite.

So , this weight is the one that tells us that we are holding the weight of the whole sky. The weight of the gravity of the planets , the stars , everything is pressing us. That 's the psychological concept of how the ideas , the world of ideas is pressing us and condition in us. Literally , a person has a weight of 180 kill kills on the head holding that weight from the sky which is air which is gases.

But it 's so much gases compressed that we are holding 180 kills every day in our heads. And it 's the inner pressure that holds us a lot basically. If we lose the pressure , the inner pressure , we fade and we can also die.

So , set this we can understand now that this sky is the heaven , this sky is the thing that sets much more pressure on us than anything else.

So , now the things that that set much more pressure on us are the closer things. The things that we have here.

So , the closer things are affecting our physical body , the physical body , the pressure that we are feeling constantly from the skies is molding our bodies. What is farther? What is farther? It affects the soul , the energy of our body.

And what is really far away affects the essence , the pressure of the essence.

So , as farther it is , the less pressure it puts on us.

So , we wo n't feel it really.

So , I 'm not speaking about metaphysics here. I 'm speaking about literal things. We are being affected much more by the things that are close to us. Pressure , setting pressure on us from close.

What is really far away it sets less pressure on us.

Okay? This is why in order to feel the pressure of something that is really far away , we have to go much more within to the essence. For example , as an idea to understand this frame. What is the closest planets that we have?

The closest planet for sure is the moon. The moon is the first one. And the moon is the one that moves the water by gravity.

So , it 's moving our blood pressure.

So , it is related to our blood with our body , the organs , the body itself. And of course , the gestation of our body.

So , it 's related with the uterus and the mum.

So , the moon is related with our birth , our mum , everything that we have within and how we have been shaped.

So , that 's the moon and controls our daily life , our life is human. Then we have Venus as closer.

So , Venus is the beauty , the shapes , the symmetry , the order and so on.

So , that 's why we have the physical. It affects the physical because it 's all about how it looks , what do I like , how do I feel about my life and the partners and relationships and so on with friends and family , etc.

So , it 's something that I can relate the most. Then we have Mars and Mars is all about action , what do I do , how do I act?

So , it 's something physical , something that you can see. And then you have Mercury , which is the communication , the learning process , the sharing with others. But then we go beyond a little bit farther. When we go beyond and farther we find Jupiter and Saturn and Jupiter is the purpose and Saturn is the karma , the history of the soul.

So , it 's much more deeper because you have to find the purpose of your soul. You have to find the history of what happened to you , what do you have to heal and so on. It 's much more deeper. It 's not something that people can see easily , it 's something that you have to discover within.

So , the gravity is affecting less and then we have the essential ones. The ones that you can not see that are kind of invisible , the rhinos Neptune Pluto. But Trans and Neptune are about the mind , about the dreams , the connection with other levels of dimensions , the subconscious things that you have to go very deep. Very deep within.

And of course , the last one we have Pluto , which is death , is the one that says , I do n't know what 's happening then. It 's just unknown.

So , now we see this , we can understand the next days , in how , how they affect us as they are farther , in distance and not set and not put in pressure on us , how they mold us in our way of living.

Okay? I hope , yes.

Okay , this is how we can understand now Trans , because Trans is this guy , Trans is the whole environment where all the planets lead. And if we do n't understand the whole picture , we want to understand how Trans is effectiveness.

So , let 's try to understand who is Trans. Trans in history is the name of the God of the Says , the heavens.

So , the the Sky itself is the father of all the things in that mythology.

So , all the things were created by the sky , because it 's the mind , the mentality has all the ideas , but this mind tries to create again , to regenerate , to regenerate constantly the idea of itself.

So , it 's trying to create new things , different things all the time , has so many ideas.

So , it destroys everything and requires from ways , from what it has thought.

So , one of his sons , which is Trans , the time , also called Saturn , by the Romans , killed his father , Trans , killed him , setting all the others free , and how he killed him , he takes his textiles and destroy them.

So , all the mines falls down into the ground , into the mother earth , yeah. And this celine is the ring , the first ring of the planet. And when it pulls here , it creates after it , which is Venus for the Romans.

So , it 's the life , the beauty , the creation.

So , Krakkos becomes the father of all , so begins the evolution , which is time in life.

So , that 's the relation of the story , how the Greek people used to explain the creation itself.

So , this is describing the creation of the things of the universe itself , because Trans is the mind , the ideas of everything , is the mentality that is creating everything without any limits. But then one of his sons , the time , kills him and creates the structure , past , present , future , it creates the time , and time is evolution through life , which is Venus , the beauty of creation.

So , that 's the story that this tale is saying.

Another thing that the story is saying is that the sky , the divine , the mentality , creates itself all the spirits. And when each dies or the process of just the mind ends , all these spirits , all these beings of the mind , starts to be like drops , falling , pouring in the earth , in the earth.

So , this is speaking about all the spirits incarnation in the process of life , to leave through time.

So , even if Trans ended in this story , is the origin of the whole story , because everyone has come from it.

So , this means that we are mind , and it does n't matter where we go. Does n't matter where we go , the mind is with us , is conditioning us , constantly by the patterns of thinking. We are mind in matter.

## Energy Work

So , the sky is pressing us all the time. This is why we put this planet in the crown today , because this planet means the weight of the ideas of the thoughts that sets its pressure in the way we think , in the way we perceive the reality. The ideas. It 's very difficult for most of the people to see and perceive Trans , because this planet is one of the most difficult to feel , because it 's in the core , it 's a spiritual planet.

It 's so subtle that you have to work very hard in order to find it. Usually , we people stay here in the outer aspect of our reality , which is the moon with our family , Venus in our relationships , Mars in the way we act. Mercury in the communication with others , the sun that shows how we write in the world. But most of the people not even go into Jupiter , looking for purpose in their life.

Most of the people do n't even go into the commons into the trauma to heal the history with Saturn.

So , even less people go to Trans , because it 's impossible , it 's very difficult to find. And when you find it , you become responsible of your own reality , because you find there yourself. The main idea is that we need yourself. To see this planet , Trans , we have to go to the death , to the shadows of ourselves , deep within.

Trans is saying that the only way we can find really the I. M. Is if we dare to go to the death of our shadows and to go through our own beliefs. And just one last thing that I would say about this , and you can go to , you can go outside , like , and it 's Saturday , so , have to enjoy the day.

So , the last thing to say today is that Trans is the only planet that turns , that makes it spin like this. Normally , like Earth , the planet spins this way , no , sorry , that way , the planet spins that way , with the North here and the South here , that 's how usually all the planets spin , okay? But Trans is like this. But Trans turns like this , South North , turns like this , and the Sun is here.

And for sure , the reason why it is like this is because maybe a very huge asteroid or comet , he 's the planet and turn its axis this way.

So , it 's turned like that. The really , the final thing is that this planet is spinning like this , instead of doing like this , like other planets.

Remember that Trans is a gas planet , and nothing can live there.

Sorry , I was just thinking that the Trans is a gas planet in English , she 's funny , but , and can kind of reel actually , and nothing can live there.

Sorry , I might buy it.

So , the key to understand this spinning like this for us , what is useful for us now , is that if this planet represents the opening of the mind to other levels of consciousness , to the connection with the self , with the mind , with the creator , is that in order to get to that point , we need to turn 180 degrees always , that will be always through crisis , will be always through changing completely our way of thinking. We need to break with our all patterns of thinking in order to access to the divine.

So , this means that if we really want to connect with our divine , we need to make a change of 180 degrees of our lives , or in the way we usually do the things.

So , for example , I wrote today the blog that usually my way of doing things is by traveling , I connect myself when I travel , I find myself inspired when I travel , but this year , the universe told me if you want to connect with the I am , within , you will have to change completely , to stay in one place , and that 's what I did , to change completely the way I usually do the things.

So , I was able to connect with myself. I always say sorry because I speak too much , because I have not pretty in cancer.

So , I think that I explained everything that is needed to to understand what we 're going to speak this next stage.

## Daily Practice Elements

So , if you see anybody asking why or what is , why is this or what , what is happening in this next stage , please send them to this video. The vibration for today is done. The statement for today is I am divine balance. The code for today is north.

In a sphere of elemental materials like iron , the amount of pressure and rotation generates magnetic discharge effects that for having positive and negative charges , or through the particles , the particles ions , looking towards those directions forming an axis. The north point of a sphere is the positive discharge of this electromagnetic field related with the visible , the external , the future , to where the forces of life direct themselves. Let 's go to the language. One last thing , now that we begin the week of the body , to remind you all that Mater is putting her body for all of us inside the pyramid every day , because now I am in Spain , so she is taking my place in Egypt.

So , remember to think about that because she is holding the connection every day in the morning.

So , just to remind you that said your intentions be connected there too.

So , let 's begin with the linemen for today. The closer eyes sit comfortably more , and concentrate in your breathing. Take your breath and become aware of your physical body , We want to do this. I let my body relax even more.

Become aware of the place you find yourselves. You really have the building you find yourself in. You come aware of the seating , the village , your art , the country , and the art of the art of the continent and the earth.

Now take the breath and start to expand your own body. Become the room , take the breath and become the seat. Take the breath and become the country. Become the living room , the earth.

Become the living room , the earth. Become the living room , the earth. Take the breath and become the room. Become the living room , the earth.

Become the living room , the earth. Become the living room , the earth. Become the living room , the earth. Become the living room , the earth.
