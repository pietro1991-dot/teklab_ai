# Day 85 - Food and Fast

## Overview

Last day alone before trip participants join. Today explores feeding and fasting through solar plexus—the chakra related to emotions, bonds with others, sweetness (pancreas creating insulin that brings glucose to cells).

Feeding is energy exchange evolved from atoms trying to balance themselves. The first process of looking for information: proton or electron seeking opposite charge to create energy. Negative electron, positive proton looking for other's energy to create balance.

Through thousands of years of evolution, this same process evolved into: photosynthesis (absorbing light, transforming light), then organisms eating plants, then animals eating those animals. This constant energy exchange is feeding—helping something grow, filling void.

We must look at feeding through three consciousness levels: subconscious (survival/meat), unconscious (culture/sharing), conscious (listening body). All crossed by emotion because emotion is energy. Food is energy, energy is emotion.

Veganism is future culture—this will be natural. But remember, veganism is philosophy of life protecting animal rights, not just diet. Vegan people should become teachers, not fighters. We need education, not fascism. Fasting gives cells holidays to regenerate potential. It's not a race to become pranic—it's giving breaks to cell society.

## Core Teaching

### Feeding: From Atoms to Organisms

Everything created is conjunction of atoms trying to save energy. Atoms create molecules, chemical elements—organizing to hold, save energy (inorganic structure: crystals, minerals, rigid). Then we have other way atoms relate: exchange of energy. By exchange, it means loss of energy.

This structure transforms constantly into different things, looking for more energy because they're wasting energy while transforming. This movement makes concept of organisms. Inorganic structure (rigid) vs. organic (moves, transforms constantly).

Only about organic aspects: they lose energy while changing/transforming/adapting. So they have to go out, look for new energy to earn energy to create balance.

First process: proton or electron looking for opposite charge so they could create energy. Through evolution, this became photosynthesis (absorbing light), then eating plants, then animals eating other animals. This change of energy constantly is feeding—to help something grow. Food: to give opportunity to grow.

When you receive energy, you transform your energy, cells divide, they grow, expand. To feed yourself is to allow yourself to grow, expand your structure/system. Biology constantly looks for energy outside to fill void, gaps you have from transformation, loss of energy during transformation process.

### Three Levels of Feeding Consciousness

**Subconscious (Survival):**

Process of feeding through three consciousness levels: subconscious, unconscious, conscious—all crossed by emotion (electrical pulses = energy). Food is energy, energy is emotion.

In subconscious (library where all humanity history stored through living, all experiences registered in cells), lot of information encoded since civilization beginning. What happened at beginning? Humans were tiny groups walking around, easy prey for predators. Not sedentary—nomads running around planet trying to look for food.

During winter (hardest part—no vegetables, no fruit), only way to survive: following animals, kill one, eat them. Nothing else to eat. Since very beginning, during thousands of years, humans survived by eating meat.

Meat for us was basis of survival. Not only meat—animals gave fur (cover winter, make clothes), bones (make tools). So many things, not only food. In our subconscious, we relate meat with survival, eating animals with feeling fine.

Today we can go to supermarket to buy pumpkin. We can eat vegetables. But not all countries can do that—many have problems with bacteria in vegetables. They still need meat to feel safe, not die of disease. We should not think from point of view of modern spirituality saying "no, don't kill animals." We must understand humanity history to understand why humans still need to survive.

Subconscious is about feeding through survival—what we have to do to survive on this planet.

**Unconscious (Culture):**

Next step: civilization created culture when it could be settled (sedentary). Created security in civilization. During this process, more food available, people could exchange food, buy/sell. Easier. Everyone could have lots of things.

This created new way of eating—not survival, but to share. From very beginning at home, mom used to say "you have to finish everything in your dish" to make mom happy. This creates bond, link with food that's more emotional than survival.

You start relating food with family, with friends, sharing with others, inviting people to eat at home to make them feel loved. You understand that by food, you're feeling part of something. You eat what others eat because you want to feel part of that society, that group.

In past times (even today), kings and queens used to share dishes so they could see food wasn't poisoned—trust between each other. There would be peace just by sharing meal.

Unconscious feeding is about feeling yourself part of group. Sharing, feeling love, trust when sharing food.

**Conscious (Listening to Body):**

Conscious way is when you realize you don't need to survive anymore, you don't live to eat. Also you're not willing to be part of anyone/anything—you don't need to be accepted in any group.

You begin taking care of yourself, thinking about what's good for you besides what other things. What's good for you by culture or survival is when you think "I have to feed myself with energy I need." You start wondering what your body really needs.

Maybe you feel really heavy, so you don't need meat anymore because meat is very heavy in energy. Maybe you want to feel more light, so you eat more vegetables. You start changing your relation with energy you're bringing in.

In that moment of consciousness, you stop just taking energy in food because you need it. You start eating energy of what you need—way of sharing energy, exchanging energy, then really storing energy for yourself just in case.

### No "Right Way" to Eat

Some people ask constantly: "What is real way of eating? What's best way?" I would say there is no way better than others. There's a way for each person because each body is different.

You cannot eat just because someone says "this is good thing to eat" because that's good for their bodies, but not your body. You have to listen to your own body to see what your body wants to eat every day.

But you have to be aware and conscious about from where you're eating: from subconscious (I need it because I don't want to die), from unconscious (I always ate that, so that's how it's always been—cultural), or conscious (listening to body).

When you're conscious about your process of feeding yourself, you start listening to body, feeling body. You realize what you need. Sometimes your body needs meat. You should not feel guilty if you feel need of meat—some people still are related with memory of cells that says "I need meat."

You must not stop eating something by guilt. You must become responsible of what you eat, but not feeling guilty because there's lot of people saying "you have to change your way of eating, don't eat this, this is killing animals, blah blah."

Cells don't understand morals, souls, spirituality. Cells understand energy. That's it. If they need meat, your body will need meat. What you have to become is responsible in way you eat. You can start to change, step by step, your way of eating. It's process.

You cannot say to others to change way of eating just by morals. You have to teach and show process so body can get used in new way of eating. It's long process. You've been thousands of years eating same things. You'll need not just one day to change diet.

To be responsible means to understand why. Why you're being addicted to eat something. Because your cells are first addicted of your body. They're addicted to energy. You have to think about why you become addicted to some things. You have to go to origin of first times.

### Veganism: Future Culture, Not Fascism

Another thing I want to say: veganism. Veganism is not way of eating—it's way of living, philosophy of life to protect rights of animals. Don't make mistake thinking it's just diet. It's philosophy of life.

I know veganism will be way of life for most countries in future. Veganism will be natural in future. Now it's kind of new thing, but really veganism will be way of living of future.

In some day in future, people will study what's happening now with animals like Holocaust. It will be same. This will be law and lifestyle for future. No doubt about it.

But thing is, remember: veganism is culture, philosophy of life. It will become culture for lot of people in future, entire civilizations in short future. We should not—vegan people should not—become like fascists of that culture.

Why I say that without problem? Because fascism is when culture tries to put over other one, blaming other one, trying to make it disappear because they believe they're better. That's fascist.

What vegan should do is educate, not impose culture. We have to educate people to understand that future will be vegan. We have to make people understand in way that they love vegan, not hate vegan. Our goal is to make all people understand and love culture of veganism for future, not try to get rid of them because you can't understand them, but fight.

This will be natural, and we need vegan teachers, not vegan fighters. It's long process for lot of people to understand. We have to educate subconscious.

### Fasting: Cell Regeneration

One of ways you can start transforming your own body is through fast. Fasting would be tool to help regenerate potential of your own cells.

Imagine each cell in your body is person in society. Today our society is consumerist society—consume, consume, consume constantly all time. Our cells do exactly same. We constantly eat and eat and eat, receive all this information, do the cells constantly. Cells are eating constantly like we do in society.

Only way we have to relax and stop consuming is give space, give moment for cells to take deep breath, allow potential of cell to go out. You're not allowing cell to express its own potential because they're trying to process information constantly.

What we have to do is make some fasting—few hours, then day and so on. Give break to our cells so it could transform itself.

Process of fasting: Please, if you eat lot, don't stop eating and start other day. Never do that. Lower your amount of food for week—less and less. Until you eat tiny little food like five times a day for whole week, then skip for week the breakfast, then another week the main meal, then dinner like that. Then go back again with meal, dinner, breakfast, again with food.

Just don't put yourself goal to be pranic person. Those who are pranics, perfect. For those who don't know: pranic persons are those that eat energy of environment, energy of light. Best light to absorb is sunrise and sunset.

But don't put goal like becoming pranic. No, no, no. Good for them who accomplished that, but it's not goal. This is not race to be pranic. Give break, holidays for cells, then go back to work, then again holidays, then go back to work. Something you have to do sometimes, sometimes not.

Remember: feeding yourself is way of exchanging energy, fasting is way of generating your own self.

## Practice: Solar Plexus Activation

**Preparation:**
- Comfortable position (lying, sitting, standing)
- Stretch body, massage, relax
- Focus on breathing

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation sequence

**Solar Plexus Work:**

19. Pay attention to energy of I Am above head
20. I Am goes through crown, third eye, throat, heart, anchoring in pancreas/solar plexus
21. With two hands, press with two fingers each hand (pointing and heart fingers) on stomach below sternum and above belly button
22. Massage in circles all around stomach by belly
23. Also down and below last ribs
24. Do massage pressing belly, moving from belly up under ribs—like opening portal in stomach
25. Let yellow light (plexus) go out

**Integration:**

26. Relax hands, allow perceive energy of this light coming from plexus
27. Spread light toward all directions
28. Vibrate: SSfaner
29. State: "I am evolution of the being" (repeat)
30. Bring all consciousness through each joint (opened as portals) by stretching, warming, massaging
31. Return here now, open eyes

**Closing:** Drink lots of water, rest to assimilate.

## Key Insights

1. Feeding is energy exchange evolved from atoms seeking opposite charges to balance
2. Through evolution: photosynthesis → eating plants → eating animals
3. Organic systems lose energy transforming, so must seek outside energy
4. Subconscious feeding = survival (meat helped humans survive thousands of years)
5. Unconscious feeding = culture (sharing food creates bonds, feeling part of group)
6. Conscious feeding = listening to body's actual needs beyond survival/culture
7. Food is energy; energy is emotion (electrical pulses)
8. There's no one "right way" to eat—each body different
9. Cells are addicted to energy; being responsible means understanding why you crave
10. Veganism is future culture and philosophy of life, not just diet
11. Vegan people should be teachers educating, not fighters imposing
12. Fasting gives cells holidays to regenerate potential they can't access while constantly processing
13. Don't race to become pranic—give cells breaks, then return to work
14. Becoming conscious of feeding means not eating by guilt (moral pressure) but by responsibility (understanding)
15. You can't change diet overnight—it's long process educating subconscious

## Integration

**Daily:** Before eating, ask: "Am I eating from subconscious (survival fear), unconscious (culture/habit), or conscious (listening to body)?"

**Weekly:** Solar plexus practice opening "portal in stomach." Feel yellow light spreading—this is emotional energy center where food and feelings meet.

**Monthly:** Try one fasting practice (skip one meal for week). Notice how cells respond when given break from constant processing.

**Ongoing:** If considering veganism, approach as education (learning philosophy of life), not moral judgment (guilting self or others). Future culture emerges through understanding, not force.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If veganism is future, why can't we force it now?**
A: Because force creates resistance. Fascism (imposing culture, blaming others) creates hate, not transformation. Education creates love for change. Long process of understanding needed.

**Q: Should I feel guilty eating meat?**
A: No. Guilt doesn't change cells' needs. Become responsible (understand why you crave it, educate body gradually) but not guilty (moral pressure disconnected from cellular reality).

**Q: How do I know what my body actually needs?**
A: By listening consciously, not reacting from subconscious survival or unconscious culture. Feel body after eating different foods. Notice energy levels, heaviness, lightness. Body tells truth when you listen.

**Q: What if I can't afford vegan diet?**
A: Veganism as future culture will become accessible naturally. Don't impose on yourself what body/circumstances can't support now. Consciousness shifts first, then circumstances follow.

**Q: How long should I fast?**
A: Start tiny—skip one meal per week. Gradually extend. Never shock body by sudden long fasting. It's holidays for cells, not punishment. Return to work (eating) after rest.

**Q: Why do emotions relate to food?**
A: Emotion = electrical pulses = energy. Food = energy. Solar plexus (pancreas/insulin/glucose) is where emotional energy and physical energy meet. Food and feelings are same: energy.

**Q: Can I become pranic?**
A: Some achieve this, but it's not goal or race. Focus on giving cells breaks (fasting), not achieving extreme state (no eating). Process matters more than destination.

**Q: What about people who need meat to survive?**
A: Respect their reality. Not all countries have safe vegetables, resources for vegan diet. History matters—thousands of years of survival patterns in cells. Education changes this gradually, not judgment.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching reveals feeding as sacred energy exchange evolved from atoms seeking balance to humans seeking sustenance, connection, conscious choice. Your solar plexus—where pancreas administers glucose to cells like heart administers blood—is where food and emotion meet as one: energy.

The three levels of consciousness (subconscious survival, unconscious culture, conscious listening) show how complex feeding truly is. You're not just eating food; you're navigating thousands of years of cellular memory (meat = survival), cultural conditioning (sharing meals = love), and personal body wisdom (what do I actually need right now?).

Veganism emerges naturally as future culture when we educate, not impose. Fascism happens when one culture tries destroying another by claiming superiority. But teachers who love both animals and humans create space for transformation through understanding. This is long process. Cells take time to release old patterns.

Fasting gives your cellular society holidays—breaks from constant consumption letting potential emerge. Not race to become pranic, just rhythm: work (eating), rest (fasting), work, rest. Like heartbeat: receive, give, receive, give.

You are evolution of the being when you listen to your body's truth instead of guilt, fear, or external pressure. Feed yourself consciously. Fast occasionally. Let cells breathe. This is how transformation happens: not by force, but by education. Not overnight, but through patience. Not through judgment, but through love.
