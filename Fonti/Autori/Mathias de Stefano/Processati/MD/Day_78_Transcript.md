## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning. Definitely good evening to all of you.

So I hope this find you well so we can start working with me.

So yesterday I , because I left myself , my personality , to be able to connect with my higher self , gun. I stopped in head again that moment. There was nothing hurting at all. I was really fine , really well.

But I had so much energy that I could n't sleep until 4 a. M.

So that 's what happened.

So I would try not to be constantly in my I am because otherwise I wo n't be able to sleep.

So for those who maybe was the first time , yes , what I just did was to let my personality aside.

So my higher self could speak. And yes , my higher self is very strict and direct. It goes to the point and does n't care about pedagogy or whatever.

So you already know that if I am feeling weird or tired or whatever , I would just let my higher self to speak.

So if you see me very , very serious.

So it 's my higher self.

So today we go to the work to work with the niece. And these are related to mom and dad.

## Q&A

So some people were asking also what this means. And this is this means I am. That 's all it means. It basically is vanish your soy.

Which is one why here the DS in the middle the other O and the other why going down.

So that 's your soy. And this represents the spinning of the cycles , everything. Then the two circles is the basic pieces , which means which is the two cells dividing the meiosis process of the creation of a bean. And in the middle is created the , sorry , is created the NA , of course , the library of our life.

And also it has the spiral , the orig spiral up and down. And it represents the positive and the energy energy is creating everything.

So if you ask who did it , I did it. I created. I drew it and then the designer. I 'll bet he did it more properly and beautiful.

And then someone did it here in Egypt , handmade.

So let 's go to our thing today.

So mom and dad. Let 's remember that mother that mom and dad are two ways in which that comes the words mother and father. And mother comes from the origin word of mother is matrix matrix matrix because matrix because matrix means womb uterus.

So the matrix is is that thing that surrounds us. It 's the womb where we are being created.

Okay.

So the word mother talks about the matrix , which is the womb that estates ourselves. And in the other hand , father comes from the Latin word pattern that means pattern.

Okay.

So pattern pattern means law. It means the path you have to follow.

So we could say that we can relate mother with the with the sphere and circle. The mother is the shear circle and the father is the line and the path.

So when we are being created , we are in the womb inside a womb. And then when we are going to be born , we follow a path towards light.

So that 's why we relate also the mother with the darkness in the womb and the father with the light ahead.

So as always , you may see that all the aspects that we talk about are biological because biology is the transcription of how the cosmos works.

The reason why we go always to biology to understand things is because it 's because not it 's not because biology is the explanation to everything and the spiritual is not.

Okay.

The reason is because biology has been the tool has been the expression , the creation of the spiritual world in order to understand itself.

So this is why we should not think of biology as the origin of all our things , but biology as the way in which we can understand the spiritual world because the spiritual world has projected itself into biology in order to be able to experience itself.

So this is why to understand how the universe in the spiritual realms works , we have first to understand biology. Let 's picture this that we can talk about the universe like this void where everything is born from.

So the void of the universe is like this matrix , like the womb where everything is stated.

So from this womb all the energy goes to the center to the core and creates the everything and the everything will look for a direction in order to express itself so it could manifest reality so it could experience a reality. Imagine this that the cosmos the void is like a sphere and this fear is neutral is not moving is void.

So it 's making a lot of pressure to the center sending vibes into the core.

So the core starts to violate so hard that it creates energy expanding towards the outside in different directions creating the everything. When you have the whole the void , the sphere , you can picture that everything is inside of it.

So the sphere of nothing , the sphere of is the one allowing and allowing the everything to exist.

So that 's why we call it the matrix because it 's the womb creating the everything inside and then the everything is called the pattern because the everything expands in different directions that shows the different path that you have to take to experience the everything and those path are called the laws.

So the laws the universal laws are those patterns that you have to follow in order to understand the everything within the void that is the matrix.

So the cosmos start to beat like the heartbeat and we 'll create a rhythm by a pulse.

So this is like the rhythm of a music.

So this pulse constantly will create different ways in which the cosmos can create and expand.

So in each one of these harbours , the universe can experience itself. Being created and being guided towards a new creation. From the point of view of the vibration we call this process like the pulse or the rhythm. This is a constant pulse.

From the point of view of energy we call that balance which would be positive and negative. And from the point of view of matter we call it fractal.

So remember that fractalization means basically to repeat the same pattern once and again once and again dividing the main pattern towards the inside or towards the outside.

So that 's how we came up with the concept of the universe that a macro cosmos and the micro cosmos. By fractalization what we could kind of acknowledge is that the cosmos the universe is constantly repeating the same pattern of creation and law , creation and law , creation and law. And these two patterns that these two concepts that are repeating constantly will be projected into everything that the universe is creating.

Okay.

So that 's the fractalization.

So through this process the universe has found a way through biology in which it can express and create in billions and thousands of different ways of laws and creation.

So this is why the closest concept that any level being in matter can have from the very origin of the universe is from the void and everything is mum and that. We usually when we start this path of consciousness and spirituality we try to reach the origin , the source of everything in the cosmos , the father that shows us the laws of the universe and so on and so far away. And suddenly the universe says no , no , no , the shortest way get there to get to the source of the universe is mummy and the shorter way to get to the laws of the universe is daddy. Do n't put any excuses in this.

It does n't matter if you have no idea who are your parents , if they have died , it does n't matter. They exist because you are born because they exist. We usually say we 're happy to find and find my dad , my mum or if I do n't have them. Well , let 's try to picture this.

What am I? I am not a different being. I am not a different individual apart from mum and dad. Because the universe is a fractal.

The law is fractalization.

So this means that I am a part of them. And why is that? Because the only reason why I exist is because there was a cell with the genetic information of my dad and a cell with the genetic information of my mum that we call egg or modulus and the spermatosoid. That got together and they created this and suddenly both of them being one did and created two and four and eight , sixteen and so on.

From one concept , it created my body.

So it means that I am my dad and my mum.

So if you are not able to see them , to touch them , just watch yourself in the mirror. And there you have. And here is when I start to become responsible what I was writing today.

Sorry , but I am nervous about the hair because my guy told me to let it long doing this process for something of energy. I do n't know what. I ca n't stand it. I want to cut it down.

But they say no , no , hold it until it ends.

So in the path that we take of spirituality , I 'm related to this image that I wrote today in the blog. We have been living a life through the fields , through the mountains. And when we start in the material world , but when we start the spiritual life and when we start to for the conscious life , suddenly we start to get inside the scene into the ocean of subconscious unconscious unconscious.

So we start to swing because it 's like waves are flowing. When the other one was the structure in earth , so the water is like flowing.

So picture this image that all you have in your life , all you are in your life , has been something that you have taken from your parents , from mom and dad. And all of those things that you inherit from them , they are tools to survive in life.

So in such a way , what your parents are doing to you is give you the tools to survive in the path of life. What we call kind of a shield. This is your shield. This is your sword.

So those are the things that they give you in order to protect yourself in life. But what happened? When you have all this stride like the middle ages to protect yourself in life , when you are walking in land , it 's fine. But when you start to swim in the ocean , you just sink very deep in the ocean.

You are sinking in the ocean suddenly you realize that , oh , I 'm sinking because I have all this weight. And all this weight is because of my mom and dad.

So I have to get rid of this. I have to set myself free. And for sure you have noticed that every therapy psychological or interstitial , you always come back to mom and dad. Everything takes you to the family.

Everything is like , I do n't want to keep doing the same things as my mom , my dad. I want to set myself free. All this is a karma from my mom 's side , whatever. We all say that.

So when you realize about this , when you acknowledge that , that you have all this weight , you start to try to let all this weight out. Set yourself free from that. But basically all those things that you have , they are the tools for you to survive in life. They gave you everything that they could give you.

So you could go through life to survive , to fight for whatever you want in life. But the thing is that suddenly you change the place , you go into the ocean.

So the same tools that you were using to fight life in the ground , they are heavy , they are not useful.

So the question would be , are my parents guilty for the tools that I have? Or the problem is that I just change the environment and the ground , I am walking.

So here you find the paradox of this , that you are escaping from two fractal from mom and dad. Trying to cross the ocean of consciousness to reach the other shore. To find yourself with another mom and another dad. The mom you call Gain , the Earth , and the dad you call the cosmos , the heavens.

And suddenly you realize , but it 's the same because these two are fractal from those two. And here is when you just recognize this , that the way in which I project the expectation towards Mother Earth and Father Heaven is the same thing that we have felt for mom and dad.

So if mom and dad are just a fractal of the universe , my conflict is not just with mom and dad. My conflict will be with the matrix and the patterns.

So the only way I can reach the core of the universe is if instead running towards the ocean , what I do is to turn back , watch my mom and dad and honor them. They used to say , you will honor your mother and father. And it 's not just a cultural thing , it 's a cosmic thing.

So this is why it 's going to be impossible for us to build a balanced world in the future between heaven and earth. If first we do n't just do the same thing with mom and dad.

So now the question would be , how do I honor mom and dad?

So the way you honor them is by recognizing that mom and dad gave you their energy , they gave you your information , they gave you. They gave you their energy , they gave you their information.

So you have inside of you all the energy of your mom and dad.

So have both of them here and now in your body.

So the way you honor them is to use those tools , become in yourself , your mom and dad and not blaming them for anything outside , but to take responsibility of your life right now. I know that sometimes when I explain this , that when I say this , it seems like I 'm speaking about good things that they give us good things , but not. Not usually they gave good things , most of them give bad things to us , but they are tools.

So just as an example , maybe my dad gave me a tool that is a hammer.

So I have a hammer.

Okay , no , I do n't have a hammer , but with this hammer , my dad maybe hit me in my head , in my hands , in my back. I have a hammer to hurt me , but later my dad has passed away.

So now I have the hammer , what I 'm going to do with the hammer , I 'm going to hit everyone in the head with the hammer , what I will try to learn how to use it. I want to try to learn how to nail how to build a house , how to use it for a useful thing. What it is to honor your parents is not to do exactly the same as they have done and the mandates that they said , like , you have to do this , you have to become this and the way you will honor them is by doing that. No , that 's not honoring.

Honoring is to recognize that the things that they gave to you were the things that they had only had to give you. They had no better to give , they had no idea what to give you. Those are the only things they knew , they thought that would be good for them. When you recognize that , you honor them by accepting what you have received from them , acknowledging that that 's the only thing that they were able to give you.

And with that you will build a new thing.

Remember the reason why you are honoring them , honoring them in your life , in the present , even if they are not there , is by doing with that energy and you think.

Remember , in your body you are made up with them. This is your mom and your dad.

So by doing the action of that , you are honoring them because you are allowing them to transcend themselves.

So this is why and how by actions you can transform your parents. And pay attention to this. I never said you have to go to your parents , you have to hug them and talk to them. No.

It 's all their self.

So also , I know that the first thing you have to work with is the biological one. And maybe you have been , I do n't know , how to say , orphan. Yes , you have been left. No parents , no idea about them.

You have been adopted. And , but there you have a lot of things to work with. Even if you do n't know them , you know that they give you away.

So how do you feel about that? The working with you , you have been given.

So how do you feel? Is the cosmos living you? How do you feel? The earth is living you?

How it is? How do you feel that? Not being accepted , given away. That 's a lot to work about your relationship with parents.

And then , in the middle level , the adopted parents and anyone that you can relate with patterns and matrix in your life , they will be all parents.

So it does n't matter if they are not biological. They could be anything. And another thing is that even after all this work that we are going to do with the planet , with society , with everything , healing , whatever we are trying to do to transcend anything to save the world , whatever. After all that , we will be always children and parents.

So this is the constant in the universe. That 's all that exists.

So this is why even if we have done so many things and so different things for the cosmos in our life , we will always work with the concept of mom and dad. And the reason why is basically because mom and dad are the matrix and the pattern , the everything and the void. And then if you do n't have kids , it does n't matter. It 's just another path.

## Daily Practice Elements

Maybe you will have a project or something. Let 's go to the information for today. The version for today is full. The statement for today is , I am the flux of time.

The code for today is secret. It says , all being all being made by this elements , the five elements. All being made by this elements has six attributes that make it an entity. These six are the tribe basis of the positive and negative path.

The way to see them is , it says two combined tetrahedron and there are kebab. Pointing up is the positive energy with its three attributes as base that help anchoring sound light and shape. While pointing down is the negative with its tribe , it 's its tribe base towards the heavens. Attributes that help awakening from density will wisdom and love.

When I speak English I speak English. Oh my God , I speak and I 'm terrible with English right now. I think it 's better when I 'm channeling. When it 's not myself , I speak better English for sure.

Let 's go to the alignment. We sit comfortable , start to stretch the body. John. They relax the body.

## Guided Meditation

I let all the weight fall down. I focus in my breathing. As I breathe , I feel the air going to each organ until I feel them soft , becoming like wind inside of my body. I perceive the air and wind in the outside.

It connects with the wind within my body. I try to feel myself soft and light like a feather. I feel the energy of my soul beginning to spin with the wind inside my body. All the colors of the energy starts to go outside through the skin , expanding to the wind around , spinning like a twitter with rainbow colors.

## Energy Work

I feel the energy of my soul beginning to spin with the wind inside of my body. I feel the energy of my soul beginning to spin with the wind inside of my body. I put my hands on the high of my heart facing the sky , feeling the energy of the eye on the sun. I take a deep breath , bring in the energy of the eye and it 's light through my crown.

The fair eye , throat , heart , plexus , scrum , root , and unclear in your knees. With a beautiful color and gentle. I feel , imagine , two rays of light coming from your knees towards your hands. Feeling up your hands with this beautiful light that holds the vibration of the eye and your soul.

In one of my hands , I find my mom. My mom represents the matrix , the negative , the creator , the generator of realities. And my dad represents the pattern , the law , the positive , the destiny and guidance. Both of them have given to me all a say could in order for me to be who I am right now.

Here and now. This is why all the things that the universe has done through time and space. Join now in me , here and now. I take my hands to my heart , taking a deep breath , uniting my mom and my dad within me.

I am father and mother. I am mom and dad. I am the everything and the nothing. I am the matrix and the pattern.

I am the result here in space of my history through time. Take your deep breath and unify both of them with the vibration. Take your deep breath and unify both of them with the vibration. I am the everything and the nothing.

I am the everything and the nothing. I am the flux of time. And take a deep breath. And start to take this information through all the body by tracing , messaging , stretching.

Open your eyes here and now. Even if we are in this month working with the creative process and trying to draw all what we feel , I would tell you that maybe it is good that when you do the process and understood most of the things that we have spoken today , if you have your parents just try to take it in a tiny conversation , maybe about your childhood when you were born.

So without the need to go very deep in the conversation , if you are aware of what you are doing , those kind of conversations helps you to balance a lot of information from them within you. Nothing else to say , so thank you everybody and see you tomorrow at the same time. Bye.
