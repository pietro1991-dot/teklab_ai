## Introduction

Prev заг WhoaمU Good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

So today is the last day that I am with my friends here.

So we wanted to make this video like a kind of a firewall.

So I 'm going to do something like that.

So tomorrow they leave at midday noon.

So I will be alone again for the next 45 days.

So before we start with our sharing , I would like to to explain a concept related to the topic for today , which is between flame , that I do n't know if it was understood or not.

So I wanted to clarify something and then we share a little bit. This is a case. Let me tell you last. For sure , as you have seen , these transmissions have been very , very good night.

I do n't know why it would happen. Besides the case , I hope that you enjoyed the last transmissions as I did , of course. You remember that I am in the airport , then I am here. Also , you are lucky.

So just for you to remember , the soul , we have said the soul is like a wave , like a flow , and the flame is much more related to its structure.

So these two points of view , this vision , remember , soul is related to the concept of anime-animated.

So something that is like an animal , that something that moves is energy. That 's why we 're related with the flow.

So in this flow of energy , where we have is a positive and a negative.

So this means that everything is moving into waves. Everything is flowing through.

So in this point of view , the soul would be the one that allows the being to leave and experience to acknowledge , to go through different realities and to understand different realities. In that hand , the flame would be the structure , would be the being itself , how it is formed , the being.

So when we say the twin soul , we refer to that movement that we need in order to move ahead in order to set ourselves forward. But when we are related to the twin flame , is a concept that is calling for the other parts that we miss in that structure to recognize who we really are.

So that would be the difference between one and the other.

So one of the main things to understand , when we talk about this culturally , is that suddenly when we speak about the soul , the twin soul , the twin flame , we start to relate that with couples. We start to relate it like someone has something that I need in order to fulfill myself to be one together , to be complete. But in reality , what really happens is that in all those relationships that we have with love and so on , is not that the other person has something that we need or we are in lack of. But the other person is just showing us something that we are not seen within from ourselves.

So that 's why we relate the other person with that thing that we do n't feel that is activated.

So this is why culturally we are pushed to the world to find someone that can feel and feel the lack that we have , the gaps that we have within. But actually what really the people are doing when we fell in love with them when we share with the others is that they are showing what we have within and without someone else , we would n't be able to see.

So acknowledging this , we can understand that the soul or the flame has a twin are not outside. They are within. It 's something that we have inside.

So what I 'm saying is not something that is telling you that if all these things like the soul , the flame , the twin , the twin flame are within , I 'm not saying that because of that , you should not look outside for other people to have relationships , to feel love , to fall in love and all those kind of things. It 's not about that. Actually , it 's by love , by relationships , by exchanging with others , how you really reconnect with those missing parts that you have within that you could n't see.

So basically it 's not about that the only thing that we have to do is just to change our point of view , not expecting for someone to appear that can feel feel what we do n't have , but to find the people , the right people that helps us to recognize that we had that thing with us , all the time and we could n't see it.

So I explained you about the soul , between soul , so I wanted to make graphic what I explained you today in the post regarding the twin flame. This is the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron is one triangle , another triangle , and one that is behind. A tetrahedron is a polyhedron that has four triangular faces.

So this concept takes us to understand that the universe needs wisdom , love and will in order to find the eye. In order to find the eye , sorry , oneself.

So this is the structure that the eye needs to find coherence. Then we have the other structure which is the other tetrahedron.

So in this basement here , we have vibration , matter and energy. That will create the eye.

So we have one triangle related to the eye and other triangle related to the eye.

So the eye and the eye needs to shape the integrity of an entire beam.

So the tetrahedron is the structure that the platonic solid related to fire.

Okay. This is why the tetrahedron shape is known as the flame.

So we have here one flame. And the other flame. This is why when we speak about the between flames , we are talking about this structure. We are not talking about another person.

Basically , what I have to do in my life is not to find the other person that has that thing that I do n't have. It 's basically to allow myself to know the person that will help me to find my own wisdom , my own energy , my own will , my own love , my own vibration , my own matter.

So I will have to relate with different people. And sometimes there is only one person that can show me all of them. And sometimes we need six people , different people to show me what do I have within.

Okay.

So I will have to do this. What would be? It would be like touching and finding the links of others.

So I can understand this.

So remember that when we are looking for the between soul , between flame , it 's not about finding someone that is perfect for us , that we match in our life and kind of this things. It 's basically to be open to receive people in our lives that can show us the attributes that we have.

So we can awake the I am. But so I 'm so sorry , but this would be like kind of killing. Copa? Copa?

Copa? Copa? Copa? Copa?

So we are entering the the age of Aquarium.

So enjoy much more and try not to fall in love so much.

Sorry , I just I just was. I just I was just saying that if they wanted to share something about what happened in the in. Not the tribute self , but maybe.

Something , you know , whatever would do.

Okay , I was telling Matthias that being a part of the idyllic. My own. For the biggest learning I get from this is that. We were working most of the last year and a half in a virtual way by.

Through the computer to the alignments online and this is the second time we are actually all the idyllic together plus Matthias.

So we are working to work in a complete and physical way being all together at the same time in the same spot. And for me it has been the greatest achievement in us. Towards the job we will do in February , 2022. In which we will be once again all together reunited.

So for me that has been the greatest achievement. Thank you. Yeah , they want to hear you. You have to shout.

If you have anything to say. Just agree with what Kita said. And just big thank you to everyone for everyone physically here and everyone supporting us and being collected to us all over the world. That 's all.

I think everyone here and that 's. More than that.

So I wanted to just speak about. She is doing like yes , it was a lot.

So much. Her first time on all this. Right? On the sunglasses.

And that 's all she does.

Now we have to translate that.

So well basically.

So basically. He was saying as not a year. As not a year. He was saying that he thinks all of you all of us because.

And it 's been one year working on this and doing this every 10 days connecting each other. And of course that without all of you that are there and the people have come. This would n't be possible. Everything that we are trying to do day by day.

All this has been possible because of that. And of course that. And of course that 's all of the things that we were able to see. And you were able to see this days is that.

## Q&A

We have been showing you that this is not like we are doing a task , a spiritual task. And then we have our own lives in another. In another moment. But that we are connecting this spirituality with biology and living here today.

And what we have been showing and living is exactly how we are. All the time in science spirituality and outside spirituality. It 's all the same all together. It was for us really important to share with all of you what we are doing sharing as friends and.

And this has been very notorious in this in this in this days.

So so I guess that is that he said , I guess it 's very important. For us to show this for this new time in which it 's much more about friends doing things together. Then something. Strait or in a in a pyramidal spirituality kind of so.

I guess that that 's what we wanted to share too. We will we will do a alignment now. We will do the alignment now with. Leave me leave music so.
