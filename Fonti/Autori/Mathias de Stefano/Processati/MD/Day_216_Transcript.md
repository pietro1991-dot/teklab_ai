## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

And maybe good night. Because I 'm so tired.

So tired that I have no idea why. I did n't do anything.

So I do n't know why I 'm so tired. Just wanted to clarify something from what I said yesterday that because some people believed that we are blocking comments or erasing comments and so on from our social media. And we are not actually , I do n't know why , even mine to Facebook Instagram. They are , I do n't know if by algorithm or whatever.

They just take some comments or they erase some comments. I do n't know why because there 's no really logic on why some of them disappear. But no one from the foundation , not even me are erasing things.

Okay , comments or stuff. We are not doing that. The only thing that happened is that if I see that someone is someone is , how to say , say , bad words to someone or something like that. Like in a bad manner , then I will block them.

Of course because I do n't allow that in my social media. But erasing the messages and many of that , I do n't know. It 's Google , Facebook. I do n't know.

We do n't do that. Oh , this is respectful. Yes , so that 's the word I was looking for. This is respectful.

Comments for myself or to others. That I would block , but the rest , I do n't know why they block comments.

So today related to the scrum chara , the creative chara , we are going to talk about the sixth dimension. We have the fourth word.

Okay , I do n't know why I 'm going to say that.

## Q&A

Okay , I do n't know why I 'm going to say that. And I will ask you something. Do n't make me draw the sixth dimension because I do n't get to that.

So I do n't know.

So today in the post of the blog , I put a picture a gift that kind of is close to how the sixth dimension would look like.

So I will try to make it more simple , more basic.

So I 'm trying to think about , from where can I begin to explain to explain , and dimension without beginning and without end.

So the sixth dimension.

So I do n't know if it 's been a lot trying to process all dimensions. But well , you will have time to see it in another moment. Maybe. Of course , that it would be very difficult when you tried to understand a dimension through.

Through the vision of the third dimension.

So maybe that if you first try to break your perception of the third dimension to transcend the idea of how you see things in this reality in order to allow yourself to perceive them in another reality.

So some people ask me. For example , how can I listen to the guides? How can I hear the guides? And it 's not that you can listen to them with your ears because in the fifth dimension everything is connected by.

All the perceptions , the five senses connect themselves as one again.

So there 's no division.

So that 's why it 's possible that you feel the words of your guides. You that are resounding in your chest instead of listening in the ear. It 's different. It 's not exactly like the five senses.

It 's not like watching a color or looking to face. It 's like if you feel it , you taste it. I do n't know altogether in one.

So that 's why in order to understand those dimensions , we have to transcend the idea of the senses of this dimension. And think like if we feel it all together. Almost how recorded it is , it 's not.

So let 's remember this. We had one third dimension.

So remember , we have a third dimension related to this space and the fourth dimension related to the time.

So now we have another dimension which is the fifth dimension that will be the third and the fourth together united as one. Hmm.

Okay. I 'm sorry.

Okay.

So we have two more dimensions.

So the way we are going to do that is by connecting again.

So we have to communicate in the structure.

So now , I 'm going to do a third dimension. It 's a weird of the entire process. And by consciousness , how to handle this two can create a new reality in the sixth dimension. This takes away all the magic.

All the poetry to the dimensions , of course. It 's a fractal mathematics.

So from this point of view , very cold. We would say that a cube in the third dimension is just an object. Through the fourth dimension is an object that is moving. And this process of an object moving through the time.

## Practice Structure

The unity of both of them is the fifth dimension , the one that holds the structure of this object going through a process.

So in the sixth dimension , all this entire process being understood will be changing a little bit to create a new one.

So this here is the fundamentals , the basis of all of this.

So it 's not all the time like this.

So what I mean is that I 'm speaking about a cube here. And a cube is simple. It 's like this , and you multiply a cube. And so on.

So it 's very , very easy , very structural , very cold. But we can also take this cube and make a tree or a person or an animal.

So the pendulum which being is here. The structure will be much more complex. Thousands or billions of times complex.

So it wo n't be just this projection. It will be very different.

So for example , in the third dimension , I can see a tree. I go in the tree. I see a tree. In the fourth dimension , I do n't see only a tree.

## Energy Work

I see the whole history of the tree. Since the seed , when it takes the first leaf , when it takes the roots , when it is growing , then we see the flowers , the fruits , all in one. We can see all of that in the fourth dimension.

The reason why we can not see the whole process of the tree is because we live the tree. And we can see only the depth of one thing.

So in the third dimension , we can see only one stage of this life of the tree.

So we can see the seed and then we can see how it grows and then we can see the tree and then and so on. But we need a time. We need a process going to all the stages to see all that.

So in the third dimension , we see the tree , but in the fourth dimension , we can see all the stages of the tree in one instant.

So what I 'm going to see in the fifth dimension of this process of the tree , I will see the patterns that hold the tree. I will see the energy that makes the tree happen. It exists. In the fifth dimension , I will understand the logic of why a tree exist.

So now , how am I going to see the tree in the sixth dimension? I will see the tree as if it is inside a kaleidoscope. That 's it. Thank you for the word.

That 's it. I will see the tree like kaleidoscope.

So the tree suddenly will have very weird shapes. Like if it is divided itself and projected itself , like in many options. And suddenly in the kaleidoscope , when I turn the image , the tree starts to turn upside down and the roots are at. And I start to see like this shape.

And they start to replicate ones and again until they are smaller and smaller and smaller.

So suddenly it stops being one tree and it turns out to be many options of that tree. This is what we call the bending and the intending of time.

So here we have these two constant , the constant of time and the constant of space. Why are they called constant? Because constant comes from the Latin word , the entity that stays together all the time.

Okay , so that 's what it would be.

So time space are the two constants of the universe. It 's always there.

So in this constant , we can understand that we have here different crosses that represents different times and different spaces.

So what determines the difference of these times and the difference of these spaces?

So when you have the integration , according to the level of integration you are in higher place or in a lower place in a higher time in a lower time. To a , to a place that is in a high vibration , we will call it up and a low vibration , we will call it down. At that time in a low vibration , we will call past at time in a high vibration will be called future.

So now , in each one of these crosses we have emerging of these two times space.

So it is a singularity here.

So now , all the energy in the universe when they get together in a constant of time and the constant of space , get together at positive aspects and the negative aspect. What happened when you put a positive and the negative that they will try to find a neutral point , so get together.

So this magnetic field will discharge the energy through the positive and absorb the energy through the negative.

So because time and space are a constant , so it is not only one positive and one negative is a constant of positive negative , positive negative.

So the energy will move in a higher way way here.

So if I have here one positive and one negative , this dot here will start to spin.

So this will generate a source of energy.

So what this will create is like this turning point like a key , like if you are adjusting the strings of a guitar.

So what happened? As much strength it has , the other weak points will tend to go to this dot here.

So this will begin to do like this. You see it?

So now this is where we call the bending of time and space. It is curving the lines of time and space.

Okay.

So suddenly the notes that before we are in the process will be bending towards this regions here.

So this will be like a sun , like a sun and the stars and the planets moving around going around it.

So this makes appear the third dimension. Here we have the first dimension in this line. Then we have the second dimension. And here with the depth of this movement , the spiral we create the third dimension.

This is how the third dimension appears in the constant of time and space.

So matter is not something that moves through time and space. Matter as you see here is the entangled of time and space. Is a result of all those things together and compressed. And this is what creates the gravity that something that was vibrating like.

It starts to violate like. Gravity.

So this strength in which you regulate the scrolling like this is the fourth dimension.

So what is the fifth dimension? The fifth dimension would be this.

So what is the fifth dimension? The angles of observation of one process.

So the fifth dimension is basically the observer which is the angles that are observing the process that they hold.

So now to see and understand the sixth dimension we will have to go backwards. Behind this. And I will try to draw it a little bit much more simple. And then I will draw it a little bit more.

And then I will draw it a little bit more.

Okay.

So now I hope you can understand that this what I drew here is like another perspective of what before was into dimensions.

So now I am trying to draw it in a third dimension.

So you can see how the center point that before all the lines were heading to the core is really here because of the gravity , the readiness.

So all these lines that I was drawing here they are going down there.

So this is how you see it in another perspective.

So this is the bending of the time. The time is curving itself like this.

So remember that what I was explaining the other day. This is like if you have a bed and you put a weight very heavy ball. The other tiny balls around they will try they will come to that it will fall down towards the bigger one.

So that 's the gravity.

So now what we have here that all this space that is holding the weight of this is the fifth dimension.

Okay.

So we have here that time and space they curved themselves creating an object.

So now let 's go into what is happening. In the sixth dimension is happening the same but in the opposite side.

Okay. See.

So what this means that what is happening here will transform itself and be able to be experienced here.

So first dimension we have a fourth dimension. We have a third dimension. We have a fourth dimension. And we have a fifth dimension which is what is holding the entire picture.

So each angle of the whole pattern here is the fifth dimension. See.

So here we have as I said first dimension here second dimension. The third dimension the fourth dimension the bending which is the time. And the fifth dimension which is the observation that holds all this that is happening in the grid.

So where is the sixth dimension? The sixth dimension is the opposite side creating the opposite of it. The sixth dimension here would be the one that completes the entire creation that gives the fourth of the entire creation.

So we have to see it more simple. Fifth dimension. Six dimension. What is doing the sixth dimension to multiply this structure , this concept of time and space towards within and towards the outside as many times as possible.

So it will be bending time and space towards the depth and towards the outside.

So it will replicate the same system. I can not draw it properly because it is very complex the design. It would start to expand towards the outside.

So the sixth dimension what it does is to take something. Is it the dimension of the architects of the universe is one that creates that science all the things.

So basically the sixth dimension is like going into the third dimension , taking a concept , a data and objects and transform it into a different thing into a new reality. And it does this once and again.

So we do n't have examples in the third dimension to see the sixth dimension because it is impossible. The only way we can summarize this is by explaining an evolution , for example. Evolution is the sixth dimension , but we see it through the vision of the third and the fourth dimension.

So it takes a long time to see how the things transform itself in different things. We need billions of years in order to appreciate that in our dimension. When in the sixth dimension you can see the whole in one moment.

So now to understand for example something much more human and something that you can leave , how the sixth dimension would work. It 's like for example the letter A. When you say for example when everyone is born usually say the letter A as a sound. When we cry.

Okay , so we prepare our voices to say , then someone explains us to say no , no , no , it explains us , but we start to imitate the words , mom , dad.

So we have the letter and code it in something in a word. Later someone will teach us the letter A , so we will write a letter A. And then we will learn about a word with the letter A.

So we will learn the concept of that. And then someone will teach us how to read a text.

So we will forget about the A and we will think only about the content of the text. And so on you will find yourself in doing a degree. I have to say this. A test is let 's say a Ph that that 's a word.

A Ph I know with 25 years old and you want to think about the A. You will think about the concepts that you are learning with wisdom knowledge and so on.

So the concept here in the sixth dimension. The concept here is that the sixth dimension does exactly the same as we do. With the letter A. For example , the sixth dimension takes the letter A from the third dimension and grab it here and transform it into a word.

And then takes the word again and transform it into a concept. And takes the concept and transform it into a text and takes the text and transform it into poetry. And so on.

So the sixth dimension is the one transforming. Only one thing frees the license it and making it much more complex.

So it 's making it complex and complex and complex from one only thing.

So in the same way as from one tiny letter. We can create thousands and millions of books speaking about so many things. Many topics , different topics.

So the universe also from one tiny particle can create all this. And the sixth dimension is the one that allows that this fractalization. Good word is the one that allows the. And of course , as everything this dimension is a polar by dimension.

This duality is the one that we call.

So this dimension is cure. And this means that like this like the hands are exactly the same are equal. But when I put one of it over the other , they do n't fit. They had these two fingers out.

So this is the concept of a cure all thing that two equal things. Anyway , they are opposite.

So why are you explaining this? Because the dimensions when they separate each other like this , like the fifth dimension , the sixth dimension are like this. Here the fifth dimension , here the sixth dimension. And in the middle we have to design that I did before of the octahedral.

So when they turn when they turn like this , they does n't fit. They are equal , but they do n't fit each other.

So this is what explains why. There are thousands of options of parallel realities in the sixth dimension. But even though even though they are equal to us , they do n't match with us so we can not interact with them. And this has a logic in the universe.

So why is important to understand this concept of cure all? Because in the sixth dimension , let 's say they found a way in which we can keep moving and not stuck in the reality. And this is by creating a polarity in which both realities love eternally each other , but they can not match.

So they will look for billions of ways in which they can match. This is a very cold way to explain the twin souls and the twin twins. All of you who are romantic or looking for your twin soul in this moment take it a breath. Let 's say let 's see if you can understand this.

Love him.

So as I explained before , this design that I did born from the conjunction of time and space. It 's the beginning of the spark of a fire that you can see this way or this way.

So these two flames are opposite one another , which means that they are complementary.

So each one of them needs to help each other to find the path to find how to connect with the other side.

So these flames must to multiply , fertilizer itself thousands and thousands of times in different directions until it finds the path to activate the flame exactly the same as the other. As the other , matching with the other. And this will give us our famous shape , which is the path the way.

So all this is basically to connect the two fires of a beam which is the soul and the spirit. The one we call alpha and the one we call omega. Feminine aspect here , masculine aspect up.

So now , during all this path , trying to find the connection between the soul and the spirit of myself , what are all this here? All them are fractalization , trying to reach the unity.

So these are people , people that I myself created and I have been created by people.

So we are all created reflecting ourselves the attributes of our soul and the attributes of our spirit. That 's why we fall in love with other people believing they are our twin souls , our twin flames.

So as they were saying , pay attention to this , I am not saying with this that you should not look for your twin soul or something like that because you are the only one that must love yourself. No , because everyone is yourself. The entire universe is yourself.

So you can fall in love with everyone looking for this attributes of yourself. The only thing that I am saying is that we should rethink about living like this name.

So the sixth dimension is the one that is creating thousands and billions of options of only one reality.

So if the sixth dimension is the one that allowed to create all these options of myself , what I have to do in order to handle the creation of my own self. Is to allow myself to love every option that I have created. Love the others as if they were yourself. Because it is like that.

## Daily Practice Elements

We could be hours speaking about the sixth dimension. But I 'm tired. Let 's go to the information. The vibration for today is the statement for today is I am love in expansion.

The code for today is to die. The last process related to the with the cosmic transcendence and earthly winter is the physical death that implies the release of all the contain of all the contained energy in the world of forms. The participation in the environment and the release of earthly magma matrix. Leaving this way space to new expressions of oneself.

The death the death process is the universal gift to the spirit. Given it the chance of letting go everything to go back to its origin. Those who are joining us in this days. Maybe you will have your head very De.
