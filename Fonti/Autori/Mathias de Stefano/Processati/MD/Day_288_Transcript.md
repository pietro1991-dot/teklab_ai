## Introduction

Hi everyone. How are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

So let 's start connecting today with the chara of our knees and our topic for today , which is our architecture. We 're speaking with this topic , which is one of the beauty arts that affect us the most , because it 's about space. All of us are affected by it , because we all live surrounded by space , by places we all move through places in our life. We can not escape from that.

So all the spots that we can go has architecture. I hope to have time to say everything that I have to say about it.

So let 's go to understand what is architecture. Perhaps maybe architecture is not affecting us as the beauty , like the other arts tab , like music or painting dancing , which are much more moving in our emotional. But even though architecture is kind of the one that affects us all every day constantly.

So it 's important to know about it.

Okay. Architecture comes from the word at a key that means , principle main first , tick done , that means constructor , the one that builds. That comes from the word tick in the language meaning to weave. And the suffix ria that means product.

So basically architecture is the product made by the first or the main constructor.

So from where comes this name from the time in which we started to need someone that got the construction of something.

So to go to the past , to go to the first people that started to build. We have to remember that we at first were nomads. We travel along the African Middle East and we were following the animals and building some tents and then keep going.

So there were many , many people that were traveling around. But eventually when they discover when they started to become sedentary , so they discovered agriculture and they started to build. The place for the animals and so on , they had to stay close to the animals and the fields that they were taking care of.

So they started to have to build houses. And the way they did it was of course with mod , play and stones.

So they started to make these kind of caves with these materials and they created these first houses. These made that many of the people that became sedentary , they just did all the constructions as the best as they could , as best as they could. They were trying to do their best. But what happened is that not all of them knew how precisely to do it.

So with experience , some of these people , the stop being the ones that worked in the fields and they were the people helping how to build the structures.

So they were kind of the masters of construction.

So because of these , they were guiding others and they were called , of course , the main constructors , which English was called the architect. A first course people were in call the , they were in called architects because they had no idea what it was to be an architect. But there were people that had a lot of vision that they knew how to make things , how to take matter and to make something new , a tool to solve problems.

So it was said that they have ingenuity. It 's that how you say it in English in density.

So they were kind of called that they had a genie. They were genius. Let 's go into the history of this. Of course , that people were not called like architects , as I said , it was ingenuity.

So this means that you have a genius.

Okay? In density is that you have a genius. What is genius? Genius comes from the word , gene.

Again , that means origin that means to give birth. And it 's a word that we relate to being born. In all traditions , they said that in the moment you are born , you have someone that accompanies you throughout your life.

Today we call that the guardian , the angel that is guarding us through our life. We can call it our guides or masters in the past they call it the genie , which means the one that is from the moment of birth. That 's the meaning of genie.

Okay?

So this being that accompanies us from another level protecting us through our lives through our life. This being was the one that we know now as a genie , the genie of the lamb , for example , the old traditions , that there were some genes that they sit here and they speak to you and they accomplish your dreams. Well , basically this story is because the idea that all people had in that time was that there were I 'm genes from the moment of birth that they were helping us to solve problems to keep alive and to have in genie. Which means that whenever someone has a problem , this genie can tell to the ear what to do.

So we know how to solve the problems , we ideas. They help us to solve our problems.

So this is why we used to say that the genes that come to show our desires are wishes.

So throughout many years , thousands of years , the people used to celebrate the genes and to give something in return to those genes. And because they were called genie because they were from the moment of birth , they would give this gifts and this ceremonies in the moment of birth every year.

So every year , they would celebrate and give offers to their genes. And that 's the origin of celebrating the birthday. Before we did n't celebrate birthday in all cultures , we were just celebrating the genie that we had.

So that 's interesting. And so it was celebrating for them. And so we call in genie , in genie , to have disability to know how to download ideas.

So this is why the people that had the ability to take the matter and to do something to transform reality , work called the engineers. Engineers are the people that has the genie that knows how to take the matter to build a tool and to solve a problem.

So basically that 's the origin of engineering.

So that 's a bit of story.

So you know from where you come from.

So when you take a look backwards and you see those people like soccer , like play to NG after many centuries. And all this kind of people , you will see that suddenly they knew about many things about mathematics , biology , they knew about construction , about geometry , about spirituality. They kind of mix everything. They had knowledge of many different things.

And why is that? Because they were holistic because they loved wisdom. They loved to know a bit of everything.

Today we have people that is specialized in only one thing. And they know a lot about only one thing. They 're separated from the rest. That 's why we have this perception that in the past , the people knew much.

So it 's not that those people in the past were genus or they were special. It was basically that they were free to open their minds to know many things. To open their minds to accept many other options. That 's not to be superhuman.

## Q&A

No , it 's basically that they were open to receive to question reality , to wonder. They wanted to know the connection of everything. That was a point.

So today what people does is to go and study something. I want to know this and I have to be the best one on this and all the rest I do n't care about the rest. I 'm just going to do this as best as I can. And that 's what makes us so bad as a humanity.

Because we have no idea about many things which is how we have only our thing. But in that time , they were so open to any possibilities that they were kind of the hippie of that time. They were open to receive. They were having sex altogether all the time.

They were taking drugs. They were just wandering , why do you know like , or the people that used to things?

So they were that. They were living in peace. They were thinking , sharing and open to everything. Open to receive to understand , to share.

They were not close to anything. That 's why we look at them as genes. But they many things.

So eventually some of these philosophers understand that everything in the universe , everything that they were trying to understand , was all related through mathematics and geometry. That you can take any one of the arts , any of the knowledge , anything that they could possibly try to understand , music , paintings , everything. And it will all summarize in numbers and patterns. And this numbers and patterns were kind of shaping the whole reality.

So they started to understand that flowers , trees , the sun , the moon , astrology , astronomy , biology , arts. Everything was related with numbers and geometry. That was the summarized of everything.

So what they started to do is to say , if we want to understand God , the divinity , we have to think in terms of numbers and geometry.

So we have to leave that by building , you seem that to feel the connection with the divinity.

So what they did was to take the genes people to turn all these numbers and geometry into one of the main and most important arts that could make us feel the divine , which is architecture. In that time , an architect had to know a little bit of everything , had to know about nature , botanist , mathematics , music , biology , spirituality about light and color.

So what they did was to know God to understand the divinity. The universe was called the great architect. The architect said that all the things were taught and the architect was just trying to understand how he created things. This is why they created the idea that God , the universe , was called the great architect.

And this great architect was one that designed all things , that designed everything through mathematics and geometry.

So the architects were willing to connect with the idea of the divine. Through construction.

So people eventually , when they accomplished to get that big of everything to understand the whole , they were able to build things like the pyramids , for example. That even today , people have no idea how they were built. And this is basically because people from today are looking into the pyramids from the point of view of just engineering , of just structural construction , slavery , architecture. But in that time , it was not only that , it was many other things.

So this is why architecture is one of the most important ones to understand , over , not only to make a planning and to build a house or a building. And this is why architecture goes beyond , goes to try to understand how everything was created , how to build reality. And this is because architecture is related with two main things.

So when we say void , void is a place where nothing exists. And that eventually something starts to occupy a space on it. For example , a desert , a forest , a mountain , they are architecture , they are constructions , because they have a mathematics and they have a geometry on it.

So from the void of nothing appears the space that starts to reproduce in many shapes.

So space is basically the architecture can be done.

So this space , when you modify the space , whoever modifies the space , it turns immediately that space into architecture. Like a very old human that creates a path along the place.

Someone that constructs a small down.

Someone that makes a boat that curves the land to so a seed. Whatever someone is doing with intention to modify a space where that person is considered the first or constructor of something , even if it is just a tool , not a house. That 's why it is architecture. Whatever we do with ourselves inside or outside is basically architecture.

So if we want to modify ourselves to transform ourselves , we have to become architects.

So to build ourselves into a new shape into a new reality , we have to take in count the secret Trinity of architecture. Then try to write here just in case that. If I do n't know if you are going to see it , but anyway , I will let it here. Beauty.

Performance.

Okay , secret Trinity. The secret Trinity of architecture. Beauty , fitness , utility. This secret Trinity of architecture.

Was written and signed by a man called Betruvius in the first century before Christ. For sure , you know the name Betruvius because the Vinci has done the man of the attributes , which is a drawing that he made honoring this architect that. That has written how the architecture works and he established this , the Trinity of architecture. And what the Vinci was trying to do was to honor this man that has designed the basement of geometry and.

And the construction itself. Even if today architecture has changed a lot , of course , that this three are not the base of architecture anymore because today the architecture is much more different architecture. That 's a neat exactly today to be related to beauty. It does n't really have to be related with fitness because it does n't need to be firm exactly.

And it does n't have to be useful for some certain things. Because today is very different the way we see in which we see the architecture. But the goal of understanding this is not about the. The reality of architecture , but much more related to the concepts of architecture.

Okay , the the the meanings behind the the reality.

So the reason why I say that these three maybe are not specifically today related to architecture is because this are related to the canon of the. Rig Roman cultures that they had this idea that. Architecture was to build something a building okay so this building has to be firm in order for it to not fall down. It has to be useful for.

For a state for. For. For the population and of course had to be beauty according to the culture that they had in that time. But of course today architecture is much more different maybe.

Architects today can build a space and where it does n't need for fitness because it 's a free space that is considered much. More I can say in her. Of a situation than something that must be whole and maybe it 's not useful. Maybe it 's just something of expression.

That is. That is. That is. That is.

That is. That is. That is. That is.

That is. That is. That is. That is.

The main one. But. In the essence of the beginnings of architecture and the ideology of architecture. This.

This. This. This.

So let 's try to understand this three according to. To our own process so we can become our.

Remember , for the ancient ones , the universe was the great architect , the ones that could design everything.

So everything is us too. We are also part of this creator of this creation itself.

So this is why we also have within ourselves power of creation. We also can build our own realities.

So the first thing is that we have to remember that the main structures in the universe are created through particles. Particles are the main and first reality that we can perceive in the universe through the waves of time and space.

So these particles have two different beings in them , which is positive and negative. And this positive and negative are trying to find a medium point to search for , to find balance. And this is why they create atoms , the conjunction of different particles , that will find a utility in their own energy , which is exchange and save energy. This is why utility comes from.

So from that atomic reality , they start to build structures that are bigger and bigger. And they evolve trying to , of course , to save energy and exchange energy.

So after all this thousands of years of evolution , we have these bodies made up with cells and organs. And when we look into them , each one of them has a goal , a purpose of a changing and storage in energy.

So each one is useful for something.

So each one has a utility.

So then with this exchange of energy , these different parts of energy will try to find a structure that holds as much as possible this exchange of energy and saving energy. And that 's what we call fear. Fitness is the idea of holding as much as possible one structure. The first one that exists is the tetrahedron.

The tetrahedron is the basement for all the patterns that will exist in the universe , because it 's the most stronger one is impossible to break in the universe.

So the idea of fitness would be to find the patterns that hold the energy.

So of course that then this one will find different other ways. Like this one here , I have more but this one 's here.

So all these structures are going to be the fitness that the structure needs in order to save energy , okay?

So to save energy. Perfect.

So then from this multiplication comes the third part , which is beauty. Beauty comes when you have these structures and suddenly you are able to design structures from it like this beautiful flower of life or here with this structure suddenly you get this and you find the star of David and many other stuff will appear giving beauty to all creation. Many possibilities to create.

So of course that this is the reason why Jim wants called God. The great architect , because by mathematics entry , I have here the utility of a structure , the fitness of a structure and the beauty through its multiplication. And the way in which we use this building in ourselves is nice and remember that each one of these structures are organs , are emotions , are charts.

So when we start to recognize which chara is each one of this , if I know the utility , the use , useless , the utility of each one of these structures in my body , when I know my organs , when I know my charts , if they are useful for me , what things I can use from me. If they are firm , if I am in my own axis , if I find myself strong or what are my weakness , whenever I recognize the beauty that I can give to the world through my attributes , my gifts.

So I will be building myself up.

So basically to become the builder of my own reality of myself is to know these mathematics and geometry. And to know how useful are each part of how firm I am and what are my attributes that I can share with the world.

## Daily Practice Elements

So this lets go to the information for today. The vibration is rule. The statement is I am the guardian of the path. The code for today is the divine.

Commonly consider like the god or the goddess , does n't imply that this kingdom is a plane of superiority of an entity that is above but grows through. The divine kingdom is where all the potentialities of the I am converge or the higher self , the supreme ideas of the web of consciousness and the universal mind interact , create a reality in all dimensions and planes of consciousness or parallel universes. Thus , the kingdom of divinity is within every atom and thereby within every reality and living in. Sit comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate in your brilliance.

I become aware of this space surrounding the body I inhabit on my own. I use my imagination to make every object of this room disappear. I become aware of how every one of them vanish. Until it does so , the roof , the walls and the floor.

Until there is nothing more than void and myself in the center of it. I bring all my attention , all my focus , until only one does not end that void. I bring all my energy , staring at this spot. I take deep breath on the side of the Earth and this point becomes a spark.

In this park , the kids into many others , it can be night in the fire , fire grows and grows. Until it lights my surroundings and I can feel the heat of the humans kingdom. I become aware that this fire is the essence of my soul and for me I can feel the home of my dreams. I take this fire with my hands and I start using it to build around me in this void.

The house of my dreams and I do it softly and slowly , like in a dung. I take the body and take this fire and build the walls and the ruins and the gardens. I become aware of what I am building for my own instructor. I recognise the design of the home.

I feel that I have been trained to planes to the signs. Growing this house up to the sides or below. I become aware of every door , every window , the furniture , the kitchen , the walls. I recognise how ingenious I am building up my home.

I am building up my home. I am building up my home. I am building up my home. I am building up my home.

I design in the center of this house as a structure. I have to be building up my home. I can become useful for me to create my future. I am holding all the things that allow me to build my future.

I am building up my home. I am building up my home. I am building up my home. I am building up my home.

I have beauty , fairness and beauty in me. I am building up my home. I am building up my home. I am building up my home.

I am building up my home. Thank you for being here and I am seeing you tomorrow.
