## Overview

Today marks the first day after the December 21, 2020 Great Conjunction - the beginning of feeling the Aquarius energy. We begin Physical Week by connecting with Antarctica, the crown chakra of planet Earth. This teaching explores resurrection energy (recovering the Instagram account), the Christ consciousness available to all beings, and understanding Earth's chakra system through its continents. We learn that Antarctica represents neutrality, freedom of spirit, and the crown for the entire Earth - not for any individual human.

## The First Day After December 21, 2020

### Entering Aquarius Time

**"This is our first day in the Aquarium time and Aquarium era."**

We're now smelling the Aquarius air with our nose outside the window - beginning to feel it. The energy is already affecting physical manifestation (like Matias's hair standing up like a "whole lady from the 70s").

### Recap of the Great Conjunction Alignment

Yesterday's alignment brought together over 11,000 people simultaneously - an unprecedented gathering holding the planetary network together.

**Key messages from the channeling:**
- The Christic energy activated
- Multiple beings aligned, all representing the Christic consciousness
- The code **144,000** explained
- Preparation for three nights of transformation

## The Instagram Resurrection Story

### Losing the Account - Losing the Concept of Self

Three months ago, Matias lost his Instagram account to a Turkish hacker. This wasn't about losing followers or material things - it was a spiritual message:

**"You have to rethink who you are. You have to rethink how you show yourself to the world."**

The account represented an incomplete version of self - needing to accept many other aspects to share from a different perspective.

### Fear of Dying to Become Something More

**The fear:** "Will I become someone different and leave behind the Matias that I know myself?"

The message kept coming: **"You have to die. You have to let yourself die."**

**This conceptual death is something we all must face someday** - letting go of what we expect from ourselves, allowing the old concept to die so we can create ourselves again.

### Accepting the Christ Consciousness

The resistance was about accepting complete inner power and not being afraid to recognize the entire power from within.

**The concept of Christ** relates to:
- The Messiah (one who has been sent)
- The Avatar (divine downloading into matter)
- The representation of divine into matter

**The critical teaching:**

**"We have polarized the concept of the I AM. We put it in someone - that's the biggest mistake we are doing every time."**

**The avatar, the Messiah, the Christ is just a concept related to yourself. Each one of us NOW is that Christ.**

### The Resurrection on December 21

After accepting this energy of resurrection during the alignment, immediately after finishing, Instagram sent a message to the hacker in Turkish saying password had been changed incorrectly.

Matias changed it from inside the hacker's account and recovered his Instagram.

**"The symbolism of taking back my Instagram was so precise in the moment that I just took back my own power as my new self."**

**"2000 years ago, the miracles were to make wine into water. We are starting Aquarius time - maybe the first miracle is to hack an Instagram account from the heart."**

### The Crowned Laughter

When "she" (the channeling entity) finished yesterday, she started to sing the first sentences of the Argentina national anthem about freedom, freedom, freedom - freedom of body, soul, and spirit.

**"The coronation of this new humanity should be laughter."**

Laughter is the best way to receive this new time.

## Understanding the Code 144,000

The 144,000 is **NOT** about 144,000 people. It's a vibrational code.

**The mathematics:**
- 12 × 12 = 144
- 144 in time and space (past, present, future) = three zeros
- **144,000 = the reset of time and space**

The code 144,000 speaks about going back to the beginning - **0,000** after 144 means we have to restart everything from zero.

That's why yesterday Jupiter, Saturn, Sun, Moon - everyone was at **grid 0** - the restart of everything.

The 144 is the code we need to use to get balance and coherence.

## The Three Nights

**The Three Nights are NOT about the sun being covered for three nights.**

They represent the night of three bodies - the three zeros from 144,000:

1. **The Night of the Body** (happening now) - The pandemic, physical darkness, everyone can die, the virus
2. **The Night of the Soul** (coming next year) - Emotional darkness, inner conflicts
3. **The Night of the Spirit** (later next year) - Spiritual darkness, ultimate purification

We have to go through the night of these three bodies in order to find balance.

## We Are All the Christ - No More Waiting for Saviors

### The Universe is NOT Patriarchal

**"The universe is free. The universe says always: you have to choose your own path."**

We should not wait for anyone to save us. We've been waiting 2,000 years - now it's time to understand:

**Each one of us is a WAY through which we can arrive to the core of the universe.**

- Each one of us is LIGHT
- Each one of us is the LIFE
- Each one of us is the TRUTH

### Transcending the Pisces Era to Live Aquarius

Just as we transcend "I, me" to find "I AM," we must transcend Pisces era ideas to live in Aquarius era.

**Of course there are people with special abilities who come to do tasks** - bringing revolutions, opening paths. But the problem is:

**"When we take our own power to give the power to that person to think that all things must be done by that person - that's the moment when we lose our own power."**

### Aquarius Time: We Are a Network

**"We are entering Aquarius time, so we are a network."**

Even if there are people opening paths, bringing revolutions:

**"No one can do a very big mission if each one of us don't take our own power to take the responsibility of accomplishing our own mission."**

**"It's not about waiting for a savior or master or avatar to say 'oh, he will save us.' No, it's about to say 'oh, there's the avatar - let's see what he does. I WILL DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO.' This is a TEAMWORK."**

### The Power Exchange

Matias explains his own power:

**"I can be considered a master of the new time, for example. But if none of you is here listening, if you are not here, I can do nothing. It's useless what I do. There's nothing."**

**"It's because of YOUR power that I have this power."**

**"I get my power because I decide by myself that I have to be here. But the power is really expressed because YOUR own power is creating what I say."**

## The Christic Consciousness: Accepting the Crown

**"Have you heard this idea of 'accept the Christ within your heart'? Well, it's not talking about Jesus. It's talking about the concept of the Christ."**

The concept of Christ means:
- You have been blessed by the oil to become the king on earth
- This is the metaphysical concept of alignment
- To be the king/queen on earth means we have to build our own law and our own power here and now

**To receive the Christ within = remember that we have to be coherent in our own power. That's the Christic consciousness.**

**The responsibility we have is to accept the crown of our own self - to be the kings and queens of our own power.**

## Antarctica: The Crown Chakra of Planet Earth

### Only Crown for Earth in Aquarius Time

**"In this new time of Aquarius, what we are doing is FOR EARTH. So there's no crown for any man or any woman in this time."**

**"The only crown possible is for Earth, and that crown is Antarctica."**

To be coordinated for this new time, we have to remember: **This crown is for all of us. This is the crown of the world and WE ARE EARTH.**

### The White Continent - Neutrality and Freedom

Antarctica represents:
- **Neutrality** - No close emotions, only void and freedom of mind, soul, and body
- **Freedom of Spirit** - No humans, no charge of emotional or mind, only fresh cold air
- **The Memory** - Storage in the ice
- **The Axis** - Connection point for spiritual consciousness

**The alignment takes us to:**
- Recognize we are connected to the white continent
- Feel the fresh, arctic wind
- Perceive glaciers, highest mountains covered with ice
- Experience transcendental mountains (thoughts of life)
- Feel freedom of all thoughts

## Physical Week: Journey Through Earth's Chakras

### The Physical Week of Sagittarius

**Week theme:** Traveling, journeys through life and earth

Sagittarius in the physical aspect is about traveling, looking for destiny. This week we travel through the earth day by day, aligning with different continents representing different chakras.

**The goal:** To recognize that **we ARE the body of Earth.**

We're not living ON a planet - we ARE the planet. Every continent, every region is like a part of our own body.

**When we understand earth this way, we're able to live fully in this reality.**

### Today's Focus: Antarctica = Crown Chakra

Just as humans have a crown chakra, Earth has its crown in Antarctica - the axis, the connection to spirit, the neutrality point.

## The Meditation Alignment

### Becoming the Kingdom

The alignment reminds us that with our body we represent the whole animal kingdom. Through acknowledging this, we share wisdom with all the kingdom where we belong.

### The White Continent Experience

**The journey:**
1. Recognize the light blue color surrounding (the atmosphere, the celestial sphere)
2. Understand Earth shines FROM earth TOWARDS sky (not from sky down)
3. Watch Earth as a sphere of light - a celestial sphere
4. Take the world in hands softly, bring to palm
5. Remember the power we have

**The coronation:**
- Receive attributes from divine mother and father
- Receive the imprint of creation, energy, will, wisdom, love
- Become the power of coherence

**The Antarctica connection:**
- Perceive the great infinite white rising
- Feel it flourish in the body
- See glaciers, highest mountains covered with ice
- Feel the freedom - no humans, no emotional charge
- Experience only fresh, cold air - water run to ice

**"All that exists there is the freedom of the spirit living in the matter."**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Practice seeing yourself as Earth's crown chakra:**

1. **Morning Recognition:** Before starting your day, touch the top of your head and say: "I am the crown of Earth. I am Antarctica. I am neutrality and freedom."

2. **Breathing Practice:** Take 7 deep breaths imagining fresh Antarctic air entering your crown, cleansing your thoughts, bringing clarity and neutrality

3. **Network Awareness:** Throughout the day, remind yourself: "I am not separate. I am part of Earth's network. My crown connects to Earth's crown."

4. **Evening Reflection:** Write down one moment today when you acted from your own power (not giving it away to anyone else, not waiting for a savior)

### Applying This Teaching

**Living as the Christ (your own I AM):**
- Stop waiting for external saviors, gurus, or masters to do the work
- Take responsibility for your own mission and power
- Recognize that teamwork means EVERYONE activates their power
- When you see a teacher/guide, acknowledge them AND do your own work
- Remember: their power only manifests because of YOUR power meeting it

**Connecting to Earth's crown:**
- Spend time in cold, fresh air when possible
- Practice neutrality in emotional situations (like Antarctica - no charged emotions)
- Honor the freedom of your spirit while living in matter
- See yourself as extension of Earth, not separate from it

**Accepting your own crown:**
- Daily affirmation: "I am the king/queen of my own power"
- Make decisions from your coherence, not others' expectations
- Build your own law (your own inner guidance)
- Accept the Christ within means accept YOUR divinity, YOUR connection to source

## Q&A

### Q: If we're all the Christ, does that make us better than others or special?

**A:** No - this is precisely the trap we must avoid. The teaching is that EVERYONE is the Christ, EVERYONE has the divine within. The problem in the past was putting the Christ concept on ONE person, making them special. Now we recognize it's the "I AM" in each being. You're not special because you have it - you're connected because EVERYONE has it. This is Aquarius network consciousness, not Pisces hierarchical consciousness.

### Q: How do we balance honoring teachers/guides while also claiming our own power?

**A:** This is beautiful teamwork. A teacher opens a path, shares knowledge, brings revolution - and that's their mission. Your job is NOT to worship them or wait for them to save you. Your job is to SEE what they do, RECEIVE the teaching, and then DO YOUR PART. Matias explained: "If you're not here, I can do nothing." The power flows both ways. Honor the guide AND activate your own mission. It's collaborative, not hierarchical.

### Q: What does it mean practically to "accept the crown of my own self"?

**A:** It means:
1. Stop giving your decision-making power to others
2. Build your own inner law (your moral compass, your truth)
3. Be coherent between what you think, feel, and do
4. Take responsibility for creating your reality
5. Stop waiting for permission to be powerful
6. Recognize you're the king/queen of YOUR life (not others' lives)
7. Make choices from your essence, not others' expectations

### Q: Why Antarctica specifically as Earth's crown chakra?

**A:** Antarctica is the south pole - from the universal point of view, the south is where spirit comes from. North is where we manifest and create. Antarctica represents:
- The axis of our essence
- Pure neutrality (no human civilization distorting energy)
- Freedom of spirit in matter
- The crown for ALL Earth (not for individual humans)
- The memory stored in ancient ice
- Connection to celestial realms

In Aquarius time, the only crown is for Earth itself - and we are all Earth.

### Q: How do we work with the code 144,000?

**A:** The 144,000 is a vibrational reset code, not a number of people:
- It represents balance and coherence (12×12 = 144)
- The three zeros represent past, present, future all returning to zero
- It's the code to restart everything from the beginning
- We're in the reset now (that's what December 21, 2020 activated)
- Work with it by: releasing old timelines, accepting the restart, finding balance in the 144 frequency, going through the three nights of body/soul/spirit purification

### Q: What are we supposed to DO during the three nights?

**A:** The three nights are process, not punishment:
1. **Night of the Body** (now) - Face physical fears, survival issues, body limitations. Don't panic. The body is transforming.
2. **Night of the Soul** (coming) - Face emotional darkness, wounds, shadows. This is soul work - feeling everything you've avoided.
3. **Night of the Spirit** (later) - Face spiritual void, dark night of the soul in mystical sense. Deepest purification.

Each "night" is about going through darkness to find light on the other side. It's necessary for balance. Don't resist - move through.

### Q: How does the Instagram recovery relate to spiritual resurrection?

**A:** It was perfect symbolic timing:
- Three months = death period (letting go of old self-concept)
- The loss forced: rethinking identity, facing fear of change, releasing old image
- Acceptance of Christic power (own divinity) came first
- THEN manifestation happened (recovery of account)
- The symbolism: taking back power in new form, not old form
- Hacking from the heart = Aquarius miracle (technology + love)
- Shows: when you own your power, external manifestations align

It demonstrated: resurrection isn't about dead things coming back the same - it's about transforming, accepting new self, and THEN manifesting from that new place.

### Q: What if I don't feel powerful or ready to be the Christ?

**A:** The Christ consciousness isn't about feeling powerful in an ego sense. It's about:
- Accepting you have the divine spark (everyone does)
- Taking responsibility for your own path
- Not waiting for others to save you
- Recognizing your coherence matters
- Doing your part in the network

You don't have to feel "ready" - you ARE it already. The readiness comes from accepting it's already true. You're not becoming something new; you're REMEMBERING what you already are. Start small: make one decision today from your own power, not someone else's opinion. That's practicing Christic consciousness.

## Final Reflection

Today, December 22, 2020 - the first day after the Great Conjunction - we step into a new energy. The Aquarius era is not some distant future; we're smelling it now, feeling it in the air. And with this shift comes a profound invitation: to stop waiting for anyone else to save us and to recognize the Christ consciousness living in each one of us.

Antarctica stands as Earth's crown, reminding us that in this new time, no individual human wears the crown - only Earth itself. We are all cells in Earth's body, and when we connect to Antarctica's energy, we connect to neutrality, freedom of spirit, and the divine memory stored in ice. This is the fresh, clear air of awakening - no charged emotions, no distorted beliefs, only the truth of spirit living in matter.

The teaching of today is resurrection - not the resurrection of one man 2,000 years ago, but YOUR resurrection, MY resurrection, the resurrection of humanity remembering: we are the ones we've been waiting for. Each one of us carries the seed of light, surrounded by the darkness we've created. To awaken our light, we must be responsible for our darkness - face it, integrate it, transform it.

The Instagram recovery was more than a funny miracle - it was perfect symbolism. Three months of death, of letting go, of being forced to rethink identity. And in the moment of accepting the Christic power within, in that moment of owning the crown of the self - manifestation happened. This is the Aquarius way: transformation first, then manifestation. Heart first, then technology.

We're entering the reset - the 144,000 code activated, the three nights beginning. The night of the body is here (the pandemic, the physical fears). The night of the soul approaches (emotional purification). The night of the spirit will come (deepest void before deepest light). But these nights are not punishment - they're purification. They're necessary. And on the other side of these three nights, we emerge renewed, reset, reborn.

So today, stand in your power. Accept the crown of your own self. Stop giving your authority to anyone outside you. And remember: you're not alone in this. We're a network - 11,000 gathered yesterday, millions more in spirit. Each one doing their part, not waiting for one savior, but BEING the collective salvation through our individual coherence.

You are the celestial spirit. You are Antarctica - the crown of Earth. You are the I AM. The only question is: will you accept this crown and wear it with responsibility, coherence, and love?

The Aquarius era has begun. Welcome home.
