## Overview

On the third day inside the pyramids, working in the Great Pyramid, we receive the third gift: understanding that the universe's only goal is not external achievement but internal enjoyment - to shine from within by transforming darkness into gold. We learn that the spiritual realm is the "most funny one," that the universe is like a child playing with creation, and that our purpose is not to find something outside ourselves but to enjoy what we've created within. Through the metaphor of alchemy, we discover how to transform our inner shadows into light and how to balance shining like the sun (by ourselves) with shining like the moon (through others).

## Context: The Great Pyramid - Third Kingdom

This is the **third day** inside the pyramids:
- **Day 1**: Pyramid of Menkaure (Second Kingdom - Soul)
- **Day 2**: Pyramid of Khafre (Second Kingdom - Soul)
- **Day 3**: Great Pyramid of Khufu (**Third Kingdom - Spiritual Realm**)

Today the group worked with the **four elements** within themselves to activate their potential.

The third gift received: **The transformation into gold - becoming your own goal.**

## The Universe's True Goal

### The Universe is Playing

One of the things shared: **The universe created itself with the goal from light to darkness to manifest different realities in order to enjoy itself, in order to have fun in creation.**

The universe is like a **kid that is playing with creation**, trying to find itself through enjoying.

So it's a very important aspect, an attribute of the theory: to have income, to have fun.

### The Universe is Not Looking Outside

The universe is not looking for something in the outside to fulfill itself.

**It's basically expanding itself in order to find a different way of its own self.**

If the universe is trying to expand to find itself, to meet itself in different ways, this means:

**The idea that we create of "the purpose" - to find a purpose ahead - is something very human, from our point of view, our perception.**

**What really is happening: the universe is trying to find itself, to figure out itself.**

**The only goal of the universe is to find a different aspect of itself.**

## The Third Kingdom: The Spiritual Realm

The third gift comes from **the Third Kingdom, which is the spiritual realm**.

For them, **the spiritual realm is the most funny one, is the most enjoyable**. They would say.

**For the spiritual world, it's important to play.**

**There is no goal outside, but the only goal is within - to enjoy what you have done, what you have created. That's the only goal.**

## The Goal is to Become Gold

**Precisely speaking about English: The GOAL of the universe is basically to become GOLD.**

**That's the gift they said.**

**The gift of the universe is the transformation into gold.**

**Becoming your own goal. That's what the message was.**

### Why Gold?

Because what they were working with is **the four elements**.

We in nature are made with darkness. Darkness means all the structures that create from the light this reality. The four elements are the basis of this reality in the darkness.

In the **path of the alchemist**, they would say: in order to transcend to another level, you have to take all this nature, all these elements, and **make them into gold**.

## The Path of Alchemy

### Physical vs. Spiritual Alchemy

When we talk about alchemy, we usually talk about the **physical aspect of alchemy** - to make something heavy into something brighter.

**But for the real path of the alchemist:**

**In order to transform the matter, you have to transform yourself first - the inside.**

**All the darkness that you have inside, you have to make it gold - which is to bright within, to bright inside, before you are able to make the reality shine.**

### The Only Way to Shine: Feel Happy Within

**According to this concept, the only way you can shine and transform yourself into gold is if you are feeling happy within and you are feeling in balance and harmony with your own self.**

When we feel happy within, usually it's because things from the outside provoke us happiness. **But this feeling is something that we feel within. It's not something in the objects outside.**

**This means that without the objects, we can also activate the same vibration.**

**Because of this, you don't need the things from the outside in order to feel happy within.**

**This is why the universe says there's no purpose outside that we have to look for. The only thing that exists is the purpose within - which is the only goal: to find yourself within and to find the balance within with your own self.**

## How to Shine

**To shine from within is not to take all the shadows out so you can shine.**

**It is to take the alchemy - to make all the weight that you have within, all the shadows, all the darkness that you have within, and take it as the plumb to make it into gold.**

**All the dark sides that we have within should be used in order to light your own self. That's how you start to shine.**

### The Process

1. Look within ourselves and find our own shadows
2. Find the shadows we think are bad for us
3. Look into the shadows and think:
   - Why we hide them
   - Why we feel them
   - Why, if they are useful for some situations now
   - If they are really my shadows or tools I don't know how to use

**It's important to understand that the lightness and the darkness is not something against - it's something that was put all together for the experimentation.**

**Within the experimentation is the same tool to transcendence.**

**By finding this dark side and this lightness that we have within, we can take all that and use it for our own transcendence, transforming the density into light as a tool for us, as an attribute for our evolution - for us and for others.**

## The Ego as the Philosopher's Stone

**The conflict we have:**

When we say "take your darkness and make it shine bright like the sun," the core of how we're going to make this light shine is something that we have been taught to not use and that is something bad:

**The EGO.**

**The ego is like kind of the philosopher's stone because it is the core where all the rest are built, because this is attracting all the other systems towards it by gravity.**

### The Utility of the Ego

**The utility of the ego is that it helps you to shine by yourself, not to be reflected into the others.**

You are relating all the information to yourself, relating all the information to what you are. So you don't waste energy in others - **you are just lighting by yourself. Like the sun.**

## Shine Like the Sun AND Like the Moon

### The Sun: Shining By Yourself

Even if we have to shine like the sun with the ego by ourselves, **we should never forget also to shine like the moon does.**

**The moon can't shine by itself. The moon shines because of the light of the sun.**

The light that we see on the moon is just the **reflection** of the light of the sun. The moon needs the light of others in order to shine.

### Why Both Are Needed

**If the reason why it's important to shine also like the moon:**

If we only shine like the sun, it's like if we are forgetting about the others. I know what is my bright, okay, but I cannot see the bright of others. I start to believe that my bright is the only one that exists, that I am the only one shining here.

**What the light of the moon tells us:**

**In order to shine and to see other perspectives of myself, I have to learn to receive the brightness of other ones.**

**I have to learn from the lights of the others. I have to be open to receive the reflection of the light of others to nourish my own bright.**

### Creating the Network

**This is why it's so important to learn to receive the wisdom, the knowledge, the brightness of the other ones.**

**In order to create the network, each one of us must shine by ourselves, but to create the network, we need to contact and relate with the shine of the others. Otherwise there is no network.**

## The Goal is to Become Gold (Oro/Aura)

**The third gift is to remind you:**

The word **GOAL** in English is to convert to the word **ORO** (gold in Spanish), that is **AURA** (gold in Latin).

**The maximum objective we have is to learn to shine in this great game.**

**According to the gift, the third gift they gave us today: We have to remember that in order to come back to ourselves, we have to follow our goal, which is to become gold.**

**And the only way you do it is by shining within.**

**The goal of the universe is to shine. And the way of doing it is by enjoying the game, playing with the reality.**

## Guided Meditation: The Cosmic Legacy

The meditation connects us to the cosmic memory and the journey from ancestors to present:

1. Take a deep breath, relax the body
2. Caress the body with the tip of your fingers softly
3. Become conscious of being below a tree surrounded by animals in the savanna
4. Recognize in this air, find yourself in a beautiful fertile valley
5. See a side the river, a small village
6. Go to the fields where you find the farmer
7. The farmer takes fruits and a stone from the ground and gives it to you in both hands
8. Take a boat from the river heading north
9. Find a path going up to the mountain between the clouds
10. On top of the mountain, see the night's sky with moon and a lion
11. See in the sky a big star coming to you
12. It becomes a spaceship - big people come out (three times bigger than you)
13. They give you a crystal in your hands
14. You give rock to them and hear them say: "Human"
15. Go down the mountain, find another human at the shore of the river
16. Become this new human and cross the river in a beautiful ship
17. Enter a beautiful port, full of colors - behind, see the pyramids
18. Walk through a white path to a great city full of people of all colors
19. They surround the great red lion - the Sphinx
20. Get closer to the Sphinx, give the crystal to a priestess in front of it
21. **Become the priestess**
22. Give this crystal to the Sphinx through your singing
23. Deliver it for the memory of all humanity
24. **I am the priestess. I am the cosmic legacy.**
25. Look into the eyes of the great lion - see yourself
26. Deliver this crystal to the Sphinx as your legacy
27. **I am the cosmic legacy to bring heaven on earth**
28. **I am the ladder of the world**
29. Feel the distant arms of the Sphinx: I give this service

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Choose one aspect of yourself you've judged as "dark" or "bad" - perhaps your anger, your selfishness, your pride, your fear. Today, look at it as the alchemist would: What is the gold hidden in this shadow? How could this quality, properly understood and used, be a tool for your evolution? Write down what you discover.

### Applying This Teaching

Notice when you're seeking happiness from external sources. When you want to buy something, achieve something, or get validation from someone, pause and ask: "What feeling am I seeking? Can I activate that feeling right now without the external object?" Practice generating your own internal gold.

Balance your sun and moon today: Spend some time shining your own authentic light (sun), and also spend time genuinely receiving and appreciating someone else's light (moon). Notice how both are needed for the network.

## Q&A

### Q: How can the ego be good if we're taught that ego is the enemy on the spiritual path?

The ego is not the enemy - it's the **philosopher's stone**, the core that attracts everything else by gravity. The utility of ego is that it helps you **shine by yourself**, not just reflect others. The problem is not the ego itself, but an **unbalanced ego** that only shines like the sun and forgets to shine like the moon. A healthy ego says "I have my own light" while also remaining open to receive the light of others. Both are needed to create the network.

### Q: What does it mean practically to "transform darkness into gold"?

It means looking at the parts of yourself you judge as bad (your anger, fear, selfishness, pride, etc.) and asking: "What is this really? Is it truly darkness, or is it a tool I don't know how to use?" For example, anger might be gold that teaches you about boundaries. Fear might be gold that teaches you about care and caution. Selfishness might be gold that teaches you about self-worth. The alchemy is transforming your judgment of these shadows into understanding of these tools.

### Q: If the goal is internal enjoyment, not external achievement, does that mean we shouldn't have goals or accomplish things?

No - it means recognizing that **external goals are just the universe playing**, trying to find different aspects of itself. Go ahead and create, achieve, build - but do it from a place of internal enjoyment and play, like a child building sandcastles, not from a place of thinking you need external things to be complete. The goal is not outside you - the goal IS you (goal = gold = your shining essence). External creation is just how you express that inner gold.

### Q: How do I find happiness within when I'm surrounded by difficult circumstances?

Remember: when you feel happy, it's because things outside provoked happiness **but the feeling is within you, not in the objects**. This means the capacity for that feeling already exists inside you. The external circumstances are just triggers - but you contain the vibration itself. Practice activating feelings of peace, joy, contentment without waiting for external circumstances to give you permission. This is advanced alchemy - making gold without external plumb.

### Q: What's the difference between shining like the sun vs. shining like the moon?

**Sun:** Shining by yourself, from your own core, your own truth, your own light. This is healthy ego - knowing your own brightness.

**Moon:** Shining by receiving and reflecting the light of others. This is humility and openness - being nourished by others' wisdom.

Both are necessary. Only sun = arrogance, forgetting others exist. Only moon = dependence, having no light of your own. **Both together = network consciousness.**

### Q: If all my shadows are just "tools I don't know how to use," does that mean nothing I do is actually wrong?

The teaching is not about justifying harmful behavior. It's about understanding the ROOT. When you're unconscious, you misuse your tools and create suffering. When you're conscious, you transform those same energies into gold. For example: Anger used unconsciously = violence. Anger used consciously = passion for justice. The tool is neutral - consciousness determines whether it creates gold or creates suffering. The alchemy happens when you take responsibility and learn to use your tools consciously.

### Q: How does "playing with reality" relate to serious spiritual work?

The spiritual realm is described as **"the most funny one, the most enjoyable."** This teaching is radical - it says that seriousness, suffering, and difficulty are human perspectives, not ultimate truth. The universe is a kid playing with creation. This doesn't mean spiritual work isn't important - it means approaching it with joy, curiosity, and playfulness rather than grim determination. When you play, you learn faster, create more freely, and shine brighter. The work becomes art. The goal becomes gold.

### Q: What is the "cosmic legacy" that I am?

You are the priestess/priest who receives the crystal from star beings and delivers it to the Sphinx - to the memory of all humanity. You are the bridge between heaven and earth, the one who brings the cosmic memory into physical form. You are not just a human having a spiritual experience - you are the cosmos experiencing itself through human form, carrying all the star wisdom in your cells, delivering heaven to earth through your very existence. That's your cosmic legacy.

---

**Reflection:** Inside the Great Pyramid, in the heart of the spiritual realm, we receive the most joyful gift of all - the revelation that the universe is not a stern teacher demanding perfection, but a playful child delighting in discovery. We learn that our shadows are not sins to be purged but raw material to be alchemized, that our ego is not an enemy to destroy but a philosopher's stone to understand. We discover the profound secret that happiness doesn't come from collecting external treasures but from transforming our internal lead into gold. And we remember the dance of sun and moon - shining our own authentic light while also opening to receive the brightness of others, creating not isolation but network, not competition but symphony. The goal, we learn, was never ahead of us - it was always within us, waiting to become gold. We are not searching for enlightenment; we are the cosmic legacy itself, star beings delivering crystals to the Sphinx, bridges between heaven and earth, alchemists transforming darkness into light through the simple radical act of enjoying what we have created. This is the path of blooming, the pattern of the crown, the game of becoming gold by shining within.
