## Overview

Day 45 marks the beginning of the Emotional Week within the Virgo constellation, a time dedicated to analyzing the deeper patterns that shape our being. This day introduces a profound exploration of the plexus chakra at the emotional level, focusing on the ties that bind us to others—the invisible network of feelings and connections that we create throughout our lives. Matias begins by acknowledging that the insights shared were surprises even to him as he channeled the I Am consciousness, revealing that the teaching process itself is a discovery.

The central teaching revolves around understanding feelings not merely as human experiences but as evolutionary tools developed by mammals to ensure survival. When animals began living in groups, they needed a mechanism to feel secure and protected. This mechanism became the emotional bonds—the ties that link individuals together into herds, families, and communities. These links created a network of mutual support, allowing groups to thrive by sharing resources, protection, and responsibility.

The etymology of "family" provides a striking insight: it derives from the Latin word "famulus," meaning hunger. Families originally formed as groups of people bound together by the fundamental need to eat, to survive. In Roman times, "familia" referred to the slaves under a master's control—the "pater familias" or lord of the slaves. This reveals that family structures, at their root, were survival mechanisms driven by the most basic need: nourishment. The plexus chakra, home to the pancreas and the processing of nutrients, becomes the physical and energetic center of this survival network.

Throughout this teaching, Matias emphasizes a critical challenge: we often feel trapped by these networks, repeating the same patterns and mandates passed down through generations. The key revelation is that healing does not require going back through time to address each individual link in our family network. Instead, we must recognize that we are the result of all these connections, and by focusing on our own inner nourishment—our own "spark of being"—we can transform our relationship with these ties. The goal is not to eliminate the network but to make it flexible, to shift from dependency to conscious participation, from reaction to empowerment.

## Core Teaching

### The Evolutionary Nature of Feelings

Feelings and emotions are not exclusive to humans; they are natural evolutionary tools that developed across the animal kingdom. When Matias posed the question to the I Am consciousness about whether feelings relate only to interactions with other people, the response was surprising: feelings are a process of evolution that emerged when species began seeking tools to feel secure in groups.

In the wild, when animals live together, they face constant threats from the outside world. To survive as a collective, they developed the capacity for emotional bonds—the ability to feel connected to one another. These bonds create a sensation of security, a sense that each member of the group is protected by the others. Feelings and emotions became the mechanism through which mammals learned to trust each other and work together for mutual survival.

This perspective transforms our understanding of emotions. They are not merely personal experiences or spiritual phenomena; they are biological and evolutionary adaptations. The emotional links we create serve the same function in humans as they do in animal herds: they bind us together, creating networks of support that enhance our chances of survival. Without these connections, individuals would face the world alone, vulnerable and isolated.

The network of feelings functions like a safety net. When something happens to one member of the group, others can sense it through their emotional connection and respond with help. This empathic response—this ability to feel what another is experiencing—allows for coordinated action and mutual aid. In this way, emotions created the foundation for culture, community, and eventually, the complex social structures we call family.

### Family as Hunger: The Origin of Ties

The word "family" reveals a fundamental truth about the nature of human connections. Derived from the Latin "famulus," meaning hunger, family originally described a group of people who came together because they needed to eat. The more individuals in a group, the better the chances of survival—more people meant more hands for hunting, gathering, and protecting the collective.

In Roman times, "familia" referred specifically to the slaves owned by a household. These slaves, bound together under the control of the "pater familias" (the father or master of the family), formed a unit defined by their shared need for sustenance and their shared servitude. This historical context reveals that families were not originally romantic or spiritual unions but practical survival structures organized around the basic necessity of food.

This understanding connects directly to the plexus chakra, which governs digestion and the assimilation of nutrients. The plexus is where we process the physical food that sustains our bodies, but it also represents the emotional "food" we receive from others—the love, support, and security that nourish our sense of self. Just as the pancreas produces insulin to help cells absorb sugar for energy, the plexus chakra creates emotional links to help us absorb the nourishment we need from our connections with others.

The network of family—and by extension, all our close relationships—functions like a web designed to catch and distribute resources. Each thread in the web is an emotional link, and the denser the web, the more secure we feel. However, this same web can become a trap. When we become overly dependent on these links for our sense of security and identity, we lose our individual power and begin to repeat the same patterns, mandates, and mistakes that have been passed down through generations.

### The Net Metaphor: Weaving Our Own Traps

Matias introduces a powerful metaphor from the I Am teaching: "You catch more fish with a bigger net." The net represents the network of emotional links we create with others—family, friends, communities, and social groups. The more extensive the net, the more we believe we can catch and the more secure we feel. But the net is not something imposed upon us from above; it is something we weave ourselves through our own emotional connections.

Each link in the net is a tie to another person, created through shared experiences, expectations, and dependencies. We add threads to the net constantly, seeking to expand our network because something deep within us whispers that if we are not part of a group, we might die. This instinct is ancient and powerful, rooted in the evolutionary history of survival in herds and tribes.

However, the teaching reveals a critical insight: the network we create to feel secure can become the very thing that enslaves us. When we depend on these links for our sense of worth, identity, and nourishment, we become like the "famulus"—the slaves—bound to the system we ourselves have woven. We repeat the same patterns over and over, following the mandates and expectations that have been passed down through the network, unable to break free.

The trap is not the network itself but our relationship to it. If we believe we need these connections to survive, we will spend our lives trying to maintain and expand the net, losing ourselves in the process. The I Am consciousness offers a radical solution: instead of going back through time to heal each individual link, focus on yourself. Recognize that you are the result of all these connections, that they all live within you, and that you have the power to activate your own nutrients—your own source of nourishment—without needing the weight of the entire network to support you.

### The Miracle of Self-Nourishment

One of the most profound teachings of Day 45 is the reinterpretation of the miracle of Jesus Christ multiplying the loaves and fishes. Traditionally understood as a supernatural event in which Jesus fed thousands with a small amount of food, Matias offers a metaphysical perspective: the true miracle was teaching each person to nourish themselves from within, without depending on external sources.

The fish, in this teaching, represents the pancreas—the organ that produces insulin, the hormone that helps cells absorb sugar (the body's primary fuel). Just as the pancreas searches for sugar within the body to nourish the cells, the plexus chakra searches for "sugar" in the form of love and emotional nourishment from others. The pancreas works internally; the plexus works externally through emotional links.

What Jesus accomplished, according to this teaching, was showing people how to activate their own "inner fish"—their own capacity to generate the nourishment they needed. Instead of depending on the network of others to provide sustenance, each person learned to feed themselves from their own inner source. This is the shift from external dependency to internal empowerment.

The metaphysical concept downloads into the physical reality: just as our bodies have the ability to process and distribute nutrients internally, we have the spiritual and emotional capacity to nourish ourselves without constantly seeking validation, love, or security from others. This does not mean we must abandon all connections or live in isolation. Rather, it means recognizing that the true source of nourishment is within us—the "spark of being" that can sustain us regardless of external circumstances.

When we learn to nourish ourselves from within, the network of emotional ties transforms. It becomes a choice rather than a necessity, a flexible web of conscious connections rather than a rigid structure of survival dependencies.

### Religion, Sects, and the Structure of Connection

Matias explores the concepts of religion and sects, stripping away the negative connotations to reveal their original meanings. The word "religion" comes from the Latin "religare," meaning to reconnect or to bind together. Religion, in its essence, is the structure that connects many parts—just like molecules connecting to form larger structures, or neurons linking together to transmit information.

A religion is simply a group of people bound together by shared beliefs, philosophies, or truths, all resonating with the same fundamental ideas. Similarly, the word "sect" comes from the Latin "sequire," meaning to follow. A sect is a group of people following a particular idea, leader, or philosophy. The teaching reveals that these structures exist everywhere in nature and society, not just in traditional religious contexts.

For example, the carbon structures that form our bodies can be considered a kind of "religion"—a network of atoms bound together by specific rules. The neurological system, which follows electrical impulses and transmits data to the brain, functions like a "sect," following a structure and purpose. A family clan that adheres to certain cultural patterns is also a sect. A group of scientists following the scientific method is a religion. Even political groups are religions in the sense that they are networks of people bound together by shared ideologies.

This perspective radically democratizes our understanding of connection. Everything that exists is part of a network, a structure held together by links. The question is not whether we participate in such structures—it is inevitable—but how we participate. Do we participate consciously, understanding our own power within the network? Or do we participate unconsciously, believing that the network controls us and that we have no choice?

The key teaching here is that we must recognize our place within these networks without losing ourselves. We are part of families, cultures, communities, and belief systems, but we are also individual sparks of consciousness with the power to choose how we engage with these structures. The goal is not to reject all networks but to flexibilize them, to make them adaptable and conscious rather than rigid and controlling.

### Hereditary Patterns and the Weight of the Past

One of the greatest challenges we face in the journey of self-awareness is the weight of hereditary patterns—the mandates, beliefs, and behaviors that have been passed down through our family networks over generations. These patterns are like genetic code, replicated and transmitted through the emotional and cultural DNA of our lineages. We inherit not only physical traits but also emotional tendencies, survival strategies, and unconscious beliefs.

The plexus chakra holds these patterns because it is the center of our emotional connections to our family system. Every expectation, every unspoken rule, every fear and hope from our ancestors lives within this energetic center. When we are unconscious of these patterns, we simply repeat them, acting out the same dramas and making the same mistakes that our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents made.

Matias addresses a common approach in spiritual healing: the attempt to go back through time, to trace each link in the family network and heal every wound, resolve every conflict, and release every trauma. While this work has value, the I Am consciousness offers a more efficient path: recognize that you are the result of all these connections. They all live within you. You do not need to spend years healing the entire network; you need to focus on yourself.

This is a profound shift in perspective. Instead of seeing ourselves as victims of our family history, enslaved by patterns we did not choose, we can recognize that we are the culmination of all these influences. Every pattern, every mandate, every link exists within us, and therefore, we have the power to transform it from within. By activating our own nutrients—by learning to nourish ourselves from our inner spark—we break the cycle of dependency and begin to live from our own center of power.

This does not mean we ignore or deny our family history. It means we stop giving our power away to it. We acknowledge the network, we understand how it shaped us, but we focus our energy on our own growth and transformation rather than trying to fix or change everyone else in the system.

### Focus on the Self: The Path to Freedom

The central message of Day 45 is radical in its simplicity: focus on yourself. You are losing time and energy trying to heal the whole network. Instead, discover that you yourself are the result of all these connections, and recognize that you have the power to activate your own nutrients without needing the weight of the entire network.

This teaching challenges both extremes that people often fall into on the spiritual path. On one hand, there is the tendency to become completely absorbed in healing family wounds, spending years in therapy or ancestral work, trying to untangle every thread in the web. On the other hand, there is the temptation to completely reject and deny the network, to run away from family and proclaim independence without truly understanding the connections that still exist within.

The I Am consciousness offers a middle path: accept that you are part of a network. Acknowledge the connections, the patterns, the history. But shift your focus from the network to yourself. Recognize that the power to nourish yourself, to sustain yourself, to thrive does not come from the network but from within. The network will always be there—it is part of the structure of existence—but you can transform your relationship to it.

When we focus on ourselves, we discover our own "inner fish," our own pancreas that can produce the insulin of self-love, self-worth, and self-sufficiency. We no longer need to manipulate emotional links to get what we need from others. We no longer feel trapped by the mandates and expectations of our family or culture. We become flexible within the network, able to participate consciously and freely rather than out of fear and dependency.

This is the essence of the "spark of being"—the recognition that within each of us is a source of light, nourishment, and power that is independent of external circumstances. When we activate this spark, we illuminate not only ourselves but the entire network, offering others the possibility of their own liberation.

### Creating Flexible Networks

The teaching does not advocate for the destruction or abandonment of networks. Connection is natural, necessary, and beautiful. The goal is not to live in isolation but to transform rigid networks into flexible ones. A flexible network allows movement, change, and growth. It does not demand conformity or repetition but supports the unique expression of each individual within it.

Nature provides the model. Water, for example, is a network of H2O molecules—each oxygen atom holding hands with two hydrogen atoms, and then linking with other H2O molecules to create the substance we perceive as water. But water is flexible. It can flow, freeze, evaporate, and transform. The molecules remain connected, but the form is adaptable.

In contrast, rigid networks resist change. They demand that everyone stay in their assigned role, repeat the same patterns, and maintain the status quo. These networks create suffering because they deny the natural flow of evolution and transformation. When we are locked into rigid family roles, cultural expectations, or belief systems, we lose our vitality and our capacity to grow.

The I Am consciousness invites us to create flexible networks by first becoming flexible within ourselves. This means letting go of the belief that we need the network to survive. It means recognizing our own inner power and learning to nourish ourselves from within. When we do this, we stop trying to control others or force them to meet our needs. We stop repeating unconscious patterns out of fear. We become free to choose how we engage with the network, and this freedom transforms the network itself.

A flexible network is one in which each individual is empowered, conscious, and self-sufficient, yet chooses to connect with others out of love rather than need. This is the ultimate vision of the teaching: a world in which we are all connected, not by chains of dependency and survival, but by threads of conscious choice and unconditional love.

## Practice

### Preparation

Find a comfortable seated position where you can remain undisturbed for the duration of the alignment. Begin by stretching your body gently, allowing yourself to yawn, and releasing any tension held in your muscles. Let the weight of your body settle downward as you relax completely.

Turn your attention to your breath. With each inhale, imagine you can trace the path of the oxygen as it enters through your nose, travels to your lungs, and then moves into your heart. From there, see it flowing into your blood, nourishing your organs and muscles. Feel the heat generated within your body as the oxygen fuels your cells.

Become aware of this inner warmth expanding beyond the boundaries of your skin. Sense it radiating outward in all directions, creating a field of vibration and energy around you—an ocean of energy in which you float.

### Emerging from the Ocean of Emotions

Visualize yourself submerged in a vast ocean. This ocean represents the sea of emotions, feelings, and energetic connections that surround you. Above the surface, you perceive the light of the sun shining brilliantly. This sun is the I Am, the consciousness of your higher self, illuminating everything.

As you take a deep breath, begin to rise slowly toward the surface. Feel the water around you, the waves gently moving your body from side to side. With each breath, you ascend, coming closer to the light.

Now begin to emerge like an island rising from the ocean. Feel the waterline descending as your body comes out into the air. First, your crown emerges. Then your forehead, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, chin, and neck. Feel the water falling away from your shoulders, your chest, your back, your arms down to the elbows. Everything above your belly is now exposed to the air and light.

The rest of your body from the belly down remains beneath the water. Feel the horizon line at your solar plexus—the plexus chakra—half in the water, half in the light.

### Illuminating the Plexus

As you stand with your upper body in the air and your lower body still in the ocean, feel the warmth of the sun beginning to dry your skin. The light of the I Am penetrates through your skin, moving inward to illuminate your chakras. Sense this light filling your crown, third eye, throat, heart, and especially focusing now on the plexus.

Take a deep breath and bring all your awareness to the plexus chakra, located at your solar plexus. This is the center of emotional ties, the place where you connect to others through feelings and needs.

From your plexus, become aware of roots of light extending downward into the ocean of emotions. These are the links you have created throughout your life—connections to every person, object, circumstance, and group you have encountered. See these links extending in all directions through the water, binding you to your family, friends, communities, and the collective consciousness of humanity.

Recognize that through these links, you receive nutrients—emotional energy, validation, love, and a sense of belonging. These connections have helped you survive, but they have also created dependencies.

### Awakening to Inner Nourishment

As the light of the I Am shines into your plexus, a new awareness awakens. You begin to recognize that you are not in need of these links to survive. You are an important part of the network, yes, but you do not need to depend on others for your nourishment. You are linked to others not by need, but by love.

Hold this awareness as you prepare to vibrate the sound. The sound for today is **PHï**, pronounced as a soft "fee" with a breath of air at the beginning.

Begin to pronounce the sound softly: **PHï... PHï... PHï...**

As you vibrate this sound, feel it resonating in your plexus. The vibration expands outward through all the links, all the connections you have created. It carries the light of the I Am consciousness, illuminating each emotional tie, transforming them from chains of need into threads of conscious love.

Continue the vibration: **PHï... PHï... PHï...**

With each sound, you bring clarity and light to your plexus, dissolving fear and dependency. You are awakening to the truth that you do not need any of these external connections to be who you are. You are whole within yourself.

### The Spark of Being

Now, focus your awareness on the center of your plexus. Deep within, beyond the network of external links, you find a spark—a small flame of pure being. This is your essence, your true self, independent of all connections and conditioning.

Speak the statement aloud or silently in your heart:

**"I am the spark of the being."**

Repeat this three times, feeling the truth of it resonating through every cell:

**"I am the spark of the being."**  
**"I am the spark of the being."**  
**"I am the spark of the being."**

As you affirm this truth, sense the spark within your plexus growing brighter, stronger, more radiant. This spark is your own inner source of nourishment. It does not depend on anyone or anything outside of you. It is eternal, unchanging, and infinitely powerful.

### Resetting Your Intention

Bring your hands to your heart center. Take a deep breath and acknowledge that all the networks you have created until today have been based on the need of the group to survive. You were taught to seek security in connection, to believe that you could not exist without the support of others.

But now, from the spark of your being, you set a new intention. From this moment forward, all the networks you create will be held from the consciousness of the I Am. You will connect with others not from fear and need, but from love and conscious choice.

Affirm this intention:

**"I am the spark of the self."**  
**"I am the spark of the being."**  
**"I am who I am."**

Feel this new intention anchoring into your plexus, transforming the quality of all your connections. The links remain, but they are no longer chains. They are flexible threads of light, allowing you to move freely while remaining part of the greater web of existence.

### Closing and Integration

Take a deep breath and begin to bring your awareness back to your physical body. Stretch gently, yawn, and move your body in any way that feels good. Feel the energy of the practice integrating into your muscles, bones, and cells.

When you are ready, open your eyes and return to the present moment, carrying with you the awareness that you are the spark of being, whole and complete within yourself, connected to all but dependent on none.

- We are not separate individuals but nodes in a vast network; everything that exists is interconnected through various forms of links and relationships.

- Hereditary patterns are emotional and cultural codes passed down through family networks, stored in the plexus and repeated unconsciously until we become aware.

- The path to freedom is not to heal every link in the network but to focus on ourselves, recognizing that we are the result of all connections and have the power to nourish ourselves from within.

- "You catch more fish with a bigger net"—the larger the network, the more secure we feel, but we must learn that true security comes from inner power, not external connections.

- By denying or running away from networks, we often recreate the same patterns in reverse, staying trapped in the mirror image of what we rejected.

- The goal is not to destroy networks but to make them flexible, transforming rigid structures of need into conscious webs of love.

- When we activate our own "inner fish"—our capacity for self-nourishment—we no longer need to manipulate others emotionally or depend on their validation.

- The spark of being within each of us is the source of true nourishment, security, and identity, independent of any external network.

- Focusing on self-empowerment rather than trying to fix or change the entire family system is the most effective path to transformation and healing.

## Integration

After completing the practice and contemplating these teachings, you are invited to engage with the homework for Day 45. This task is designed to bring conscious awareness to the emotional links that have the strongest hold on your life.

**Homework:** Write down the biggest emotional and feeling links you have in your life today. These are the connections that most influence your sense of security, identity, and well-being. Consider relationships with family members, romantic partners, friends, or groups. Notice which links feel supportive and which feel like obligations or traps.

As you write, avoid judgment. Simply observe and acknowledge these connections. The goal is not to cut ties or change relationships immediately, but to become conscious of how these links function in your life. Ask yourself: Which of these connections am I maintaining out of love, and which out of need or fear? Where am I giving my power away to the network instead of claiming it for myself?

This awareness is the first step toward transforming your relationship with the network, moving from unconscious dependency to conscious participation, and ultimately activating your own inner spark of being.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If feelings are just evolutionary tools for survival, does that mean they're not real or important?**

A: No, feelings are absolutely real and important. Understanding their evolutionary origin does not diminish their value; it helps us see them more clearly. Feelings are tools, yes, but they are also the essence of our experience as living beings. The key is to recognize that we are not slaves to our feelings. We can use them consciously rather than being unconsciously driven by them.

**Q: How can I nourish myself from within when I genuinely need support from others?**

A: Self-nourishment doesn't mean complete isolation or independence. We are social beings, and connection is natural and healthy. The teaching is about shifting from *needing* others to survive to *choosing* to connect with others from a place of wholeness. When you nourish yourself first, you come to relationships as a full person rather than an empty vessel seeking to be filled.

**Q: What if my family patterns are very strong and I keep repeating them even though I'm aware of them?**

A: Awareness is the first step, but transformation requires practice. It's not enough to know intellectually that you're repeating patterns; you must actively work with your plexus chakra to release the emotional charge attached to these patterns. The vibration practice with PHï is designed to help with this. Repeat it regularly, and over time, you'll find the patterns losing their grip.

**Q: Does this teaching mean I should cut ties with toxic family members?**

A: The teaching is not about cutting ties or maintaining them; it's about changing your relationship to the ties. When you focus on yourself and activate your own inner nourishment, you become less reactive to toxic dynamics. You may choose to create boundaries, or you may find that the relationships naturally transform as you stop feeding them with dependency and fear. The decision comes from empowerment, not reaction.

**Q: How do I know if I'm connecting with others from love or from need?**

A: Ask yourself: Do I feel anxious or insecure when this person is not available? Do I require their validation to feel good about myself? Do I feel obligated to maintain this connection even when it drains me? If yes, you're likely connecting from need. Love-based connections feel expansive, free, and mutual. They enhance your life without defining it.

**Q: What is the "inner fish" and how do I activate it?**

A: The inner fish is a metaphor for your own capacity to generate the nourishment you need. Physically, it represents the pancreas producing insulin to feed your cells. Energetically, it represents your ability to generate self-love, self-worth, and self-security from within. You activate it through practices like this alignment, through self-reflection, and through consciously choosing to validate and support yourself rather than seeking these things primarily from others.

**Q: Can I really transform my entire family network just by working on myself?**

A: Yes, but not in the way you might think. You cannot control or change other people, but when you transform yourself, you change the energetic dynamics of the entire system. You stop playing the same roles, stop feeding the same patterns, and stop reacting in predictable ways. This creates space for others to shift as well, though they may or may not choose to. Your transformation is yours; their transformation is theirs.

**Q: Why is it important to understand the etymology of words like "family" and "religion"?**

A: Etymology reveals the original meaning and energy behind concepts that have become distorted over time. When we understand that "family" meant "hunger" and was about survival, we can see more clearly how our modern family dynamics still operate from survival patterns. This awareness helps us make conscious choices rather than unconsciously repeating ancient programs.

**Q: What does it mean to create a flexible network?**

A: A flexible network is one in which the connections allow for movement, change, and individual growth. Instead of rigid roles and expectations, there is space for each person to evolve and express their authentic self. Flexibility means you can be close to someone when it serves both of you and create distance when needed, without guilt or drama. It means relationships adapt to changing circumstances rather than trying to force everyone to stay the same.

**Q: Is it selfish to focus on myself instead of trying to heal my family?**

A: Focusing on yourself is not selfish; it's the most effective and responsible thing you can do. When you heal yourself, you stop contributing to the dysfunction in the system. You stop draining others, stop demanding that they meet your needs, and stop perpetuating unconscious patterns. This creates the greatest possibility for collective healing. You cannot heal anyone else; you can only heal yourself and offer that healed presence to the world.

**Q: How long does it take to activate the spark of being and become self-sufficient?**

A: This is a journey, not a destination. Some people experience immediate shifts; for others, it's a gradual process. What matters is consistent practice and genuine self-inquiry. Each time you choose to nourish yourself from within rather than seeking validation externally, you strengthen the spark. Over time, it becomes your default way of being. Be patient with yourself and trust the process.

**Q: What should I do with the list of emotional links I create for homework?**

A: Use the list as a tool for awareness. Look at each link and ask yourself: Is this connection based on love or need? Am I giving my power away in this relationship? What would change if I fully owned my own capacity to nourish myself? Don't rush to change anything externally. Let the awareness work on you internally first. Transformation happens from the inside out.
