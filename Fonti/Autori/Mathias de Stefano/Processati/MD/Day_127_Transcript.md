## Overview

Today we explore determination - not as rigid stubbornness, but as the universal law that creates patterns while allowing transformation. We learn how laws provide security and order, how determination can both limit and guide us, and how the seven universal laws help us navigate without getting lost in the fractal complexity of existence.

## What Is Determination?

### The Concept of "Terminus"

**Determination** relates to something that **has an ending** - it has a **terminus**. It means it arrives to an end, a limit, a termination.

Determination is the idea that **you can see something ahead that has an ending**. That's the limit - it ends there, it terminates at the end.

Once I know that end, **everything I'm going to do from this moment will be determined by that ending I already know**. Also, everything I'm going to leave, everything I'm going to experience, will be **determined and conditioned** by that determination I have ahead in the future.

### The Beginning, Not the End

Something important: The word determination is **not exactly describing the moment when you arrive at the end**. It's talking about **the process of getting to that end**.

Culturally, we **don't talk about the ending** of determination - we talk about **the beginning** of determination.

When we say **"From now on, I am determined to do this or that,"** it's like saying: **"There's no other option than the one I choose right now."**

Everything I'm going to do will be determined by what I just said. **We put the determination at the beginning, not at the end.**

## Determination as a Law

### Examples of Determination

When we say **"I'm determined to say no to this, I don't want to do this or that"** - that's a determination because you're saying something that **will condition everything ahead**.

When you say "no" right now, you're **conditioning the future** - all times that something similar to what's happening now will be faced the same way. You are determined to say "no" to similar situations.

**In the present, you settle the determination of all goals ahead in the future.**

### For the Universe: Determination is Law

For the universe, determination is **not only a choice** - determination is a **law**.

By the **law of determination**: When you say something and set the intention and the word of saying something, the universe interprets this to **repeat it every time** in each cycle of experimentation and existence in reality.

**That's why it's a law** - now it's determined to be like this in every cycle.

### Patterns and Creeds

The determination of our energy, our works, is what conditions us to live life after life leaving the same things - we **repeat the same things** because of this determination.

This system of determination has many names:
- **Patterns** - determined behaviors
- **Creeds** - statements of belief
- **Statements** - declarations of intent

## The Use of Determination

**What's the use of determination?**

The use is to **feel safe, secure** - to know that whatever happens in the future will be similar. You'll be secure and harmonized because you now know what's going to happen.

**Determination that becomes a law over time helps us feel secure.**

This is why, throughout history, cultures and societies create **determined laws** - because laws make us feel safe.

## Examples of Laws

### Different Types of Laws

We have many kinds of laws:

1. **Unconscious laws**: "Heaven is above, earth is below" - that's a determination
2. **Social laws**: Tell us what is good, what is not
3. **Universal laws**: "As above, so below" and the seven primary laws

### What Is a Law for Humans?

A law is **a way to feel safe and secure**.

For sure, we all agree there are many laws we don't like. But there are many other laws that each of us needs. So what is a law, a determination?

**A law for me is**: "This should be like this. Always. This should always be like this."

For example: **Human rights** - human rights should always be like this.

There are many other laws we're not really willing to accomplish. Some laws don't have any sense or meaning - maybe they're so old they're not related to the moment we're living. So we decide to **change the laws**.

### Laws Can Change

**You see that if there's a law that bothers you, you can change it.** We can change laws.

**Why can laws change if determination is supposed to be fixed?**

Laws are written by a **group of people** concerning the consciousness or unconscious mind of a society. A great group of people creates laws because they're the idea of **feeling safe with that law**.

**Laws are not made to control people. Laws are made so people feel safe.**

### When People Change, Laws Change

What happens when people change? If people change because the environment changes, people change. So they say: **"Okay, now we don't need that law anymore. We have to change it."**

But what happens? When people say "We don't need this law anymore, we need to change it," the **system that absorbed that law** says: **"Hey, but you DETERMINED this law. You said if it's determined, we have to repeat it. It has to keep going."**

### Who's Responsible?

**A law is not something imposed over us** - it's something **we created for us** according to our level of consciousness.

**It's not the government to blame, not the system to blame.** If we are the ones who changed, **we are the ones who must propose change in the system**.

We cannot blame the government because **the government is just the extension of the system**. The government cannot propose anything different.

**In history, constantly, every revolution and transformation was because of the people** - the environment changing, the context changed, the people changing and **pushing the government** to do what they do.

The government is just doing what it was supposed to do according to the main laws of the past.

## Universal Determination

### The Law of Duality

From the universal point of view: The universe from within creates the outside, projects outside. This creates **negative and positive aspects**, and it starts to become a law.

**The law of repeating the system of negative to create everything** - the system will be replicated everywhere in the universe. Internal and external, negative and positive will be in every dimension, in every world.

**Everything that exists will be connected by this law.**

### Adventure Within Law

Once you have this law, you have the **possibility to change this law** - which is what we spoke about yesterday regarding **adventure**.

Adventure is what allows the determined pattern of duality and polarity to **transform itself in many different ways**:
- Creates all chemical elements
- Creates evolution on every planet
- Creates our reality in this world
- Creates art, everything

What is determined in the universe can also **change, adapting to new environments**.

## Individual Determination

### Our Unique Essence

Each one of us has a **essence within that is determined by our being** - this will repeat constantly in the universe.

But through the expression of the universe, **we will change, we totally change constantly**. We adapt to our new environments.

**Nothing that we believe is determined in the universe is really determined.**

### The Only True Determinations

**The only things truly determined in the universe are the seven laws of the universe.**

These laws go all through us, creating all of us. But at the same time, these same laws **allow the originality of each one of us to exist**.

## What Determination Really Is

For the universe, **determination is basically a guide to help you not get lost** in this reality, in the universe.

### The Fractal Universe

The universe is something **fractalizing constantly**. Everything fractalizing in the universe takes you from path to distorted path.

If you have an issue and don't know what your fractalization is, why you're fractalizing - **you're lost, you don't know where you are**.

### The Seven Laws as Guide

When you take the **seven laws** and see the whole (the bigger picture or small picture), **seven laws are the same** because they're determining the whole universe.

**It doesn't matter where in creation - you'll find out exactly what to do because they repeat constantly.**

Basically, **seven laws are the determinations that help us not get lost in the universe**.

## Where Can You Get Lost?

**Where can you get lost in the universe?**

You can only get lost **in your own determination** - in your mind.

Remember: **The universe doesn't exist.** You cannot get lost in the universe because really **you are always here and now**.

That's basically what it is. So we have to pick our own determinations.

### Lost in Beliefs

**What determinations make us lost?**

The determinations that make us lost are **our own beliefs and patterns**.

You get lost in the determination of your beliefs because they **lock you into just your own point of view**. You cannot see the rest, the other points of view, the whole thing, the whole picture.

## Good vs. Bad Determination

### Limiting Determination

One of the main things to understand about our determinations: Are they **limiting us** or **helping us**?

Determination can **limit you** because it says: "It doesn't matter what happens, this will always be the same."

You're not living the possibility to change the way you're living. It will repeat once and again. **You're trapped in your own system.**

### Guiding Determination

The good way of seeing determination is when you say: **"I am determined to do this."**

For example, the teacher says: "I am determined to finish this planetary task." You go to the point. The universe will remind you that you have to do that.

**If you wouldn't have the determination, your life wouldn't have an axis.**

But if you would live your life **through determination** - you wouldn't be able to change and transform yourself ever.

## The Key Balance

What we have to do in our lives is know how to:
- **Have determination to help us go through life** (like a guide)
- **Not let determination tell us how to live** (like a prison)

### Important Distinction

Remember what was said:
- **The concept of law** is what makes us be in axis, live in our axis
- **The laws themselves** (different laws) are the ones that must change in order to evolve

**The concept of law is permanent.** The **specific laws** are what change by context.

## Laws in Nature

Laws are not only human - **laws are everywhere**:
- In nature
- In herds
- In colonies
- In forests

**Laws are the order of things.** Without laws - chaos. **So what is order?**

- **Order = Harmony** (this shape)
- **Chaos = Disharmony** (another shape)

**What is better?**

The universe generates **chaos in order to find order**. This is why when we say something is chaotic, we try to bring order - it's a **law of harmonics**.

**To put order into chaos, we call that "law."**

## The Nature of Laws

The **concept of law/determination** is having something that shows us the **pattern of order**.

The **different laws must change** because they change according to environment, according to context.

### Example: Slavery

Close to our time, there was a law that supported buying and selling humans - **slaves**. It was normal because the context saw that as normal.

Now we changed. We don't have this kind of law supporting buying people. Now there are **laws against that**.

**We all change.** We need to recognize that everything constituting a group of people (like a constitution) - if those people have changed, **the constitution must also change**.

## Microcosm and Macrocosm

To close: Remember the inside universe - the negative and positive of the universe create the **electron and proton**.

A proton and electron (positive and negative) try to be together constantly, creating an **atom**. They create more of them, creating:
- Chemical compounds
- Then elements
- Then Earth and planets and suns
- All reality
- Evolution
- Organic life
- Thoughts
- Everything - just because of that

### The Question

Is the **mind of the universe** determining everything that happens and exists? Or is it **our consciousness** that determines existence?

**In the microcosmos, we (the subject) and the context are the same.**

**It's ourselves who are determining the whole universe** - it's us from the microcosmos who shape the macrocosmos.

## The Cuboctahedron Geometry

This geometrical pattern originates from the **combination of tetrahedron with cube**, constituting:
- **14 faces** (6 squared, 8 triangular)
- **24 edges**
- **12 vertices**

Its potential lies in being the **seed of creation being expressed** - the union of primordial forms with the oval, sperm and uterus, creating life, generating the potential of creativity.

This pattern originates the center of energetic power of the **sacral chakra** (yesterday's focus, connected to today's root).

## Guided Meditation: Rooted in Determined Realization

The meditation journey:

1. Sit comfortably, focus on breathing
2. Become a seed below earth, flourishing from mud
3. Let roots grow deep into ground
4. Leaves go up searching for light
5. Hear animals of forest, accompany growth
6. Go through branches and leaves of Tree of Light
7. Grab its roots with yours
8. Reach light of sun, come out from tree
9. Watch whole forest from above, savanna full of animals
10. Accompany flower growth with hands toward sky
11. See beyond - coast, ocean, rainforest, horizon
12. Sun, sky, clouds lighten everything
13. Absorb light, open entire flower
14. Go through atmosphere, reaching space
15. Light you searched for now shines on Earth's surface
16. See Africa, horizon, Europe, Middle East, Asia
17. Get farther, turn around Earth
18. See Americas, Pacific Ocean, Oceania, Antarctica
19. See every spot of Earth - **there's a root**
20. In lines and oceans, roots heading within planet
21. **You are part of the roots of this world**
22. **You are part of the realization of this world**
23. **You are determined to be part of its transformation**

**Take this world with your hands** - bring all its roots toward your aura in your genitals (root/sacral area). **Become one with realization in the reality of your vibration.**

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Yuu

**Statement:** I am the dimension of realization (I am part of the realization of this reality)

**Code:** The Cuboctahedron - seed of creation expressed, union of primordial forms, potential of creativity

**Meditation Focus:**
- Recognize your personal determinations
- Distinguish limiting vs. guiding determinations
- Understand laws provide order and security
- Accept that laws must change as consciousness evolves
- Root yourself in the seven universal laws
- Determination to be part of Earth's transformation

**Integration:**
- Examine your personal "laws" (beliefs, patterns)
- Ask: Does this determination limit or guide me?
- Identify which determinations need to change
- Remember: You determine the universe from within
- Set new, conscious determinations for growth

**Monthly Task Reminder:**
Take note each day of a place you've been and something you've learned from that place.

**Reflection:** Determination is paradoxical - it creates patterns for security while allowing transformation for growth. We need determination to feel safe and oriented, to have an axis through life. But we cannot let old determinations imprison us when consciousness evolves. The seven universal laws are the only true permanent determinations - everything else must adapt to changing contexts. Laws are not imposed from above to control us; they emerge from our collective consciousness to provide order and harmony. When we outgrow a law, we must change it. The universe generates chaos to find new order. We are not trapped by cosmic determination - we ARE the determining force, shaping reality from the microcosm. Our task is to examine our personal determinations (beliefs, patterns, creeds) and consciously choose which guide us forward and which hold us back. In this way, we become co-creators of universal realization, rooted in eternal principles while flowering into infinite possibilities.
