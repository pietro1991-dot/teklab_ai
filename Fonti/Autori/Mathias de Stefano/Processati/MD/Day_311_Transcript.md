## Introduction

Hi everybody. How are you?

So sorry for the delay of one hour. But today we came out from the permit really late and I needed to anchor myself.

So I needed to eat before because I was really up there.

So I needed to be grounded.

Today I slept two hours , just two hours. And it was really intense day. We have been in the pyramid with all the people. Then we went to the Abu Ghana for the for the active with the with the son right in my head.

And also then from there we went again to the Greek pyramid with just the top of us.

So we 've been since 3 a. M. Till 7 30 p. M.

Straight all day doing many things. All these things in every one of the temples we were.

So I just left two hours and I 've been channeling the whole time. That this today was channeling all day.

So I would love to tell you what happened because it 's really really powerful. But I guess it 's not today to explain this because I 'm really really tired.

Today even though all the things that that happened today. I wanted to be here for alignment because.

Today is a very special day very important because it 's not only an eclipse today is the eclipse because it was on the north ball exactly.

So it basically represents. A switch of awareness of switch of the planet. And it also opens the stage of our path which is the dragons path. That starts in August and ends in November.

So the process is kind of surrounded by the two eclipse.

So this is the beginning of that energy that we will work for the next month. As you see , I am tired. I I looked tired because I 'm really tired. I always let two hours.

But I 'm really happy actually. I 'm really really glad with everything that we did and it was amazing everything was was incredible. And so I can wait to tell you. But I 've been traveling the whole day so that 's why I 'm so tired.

## Q&A

But I want to say that. I would love to start this alignment with you because of the importance of the day. I hope that that you could be connected with the eclipse with the task that I gave to you. And also I hope that those will were in the north of Europe were able to see it to see the eclipse.

And connect with that.

So of course I would say that I know that we had many concepts spoken.

So I would try to to to to make some of them to explain them eventually in the next weeks.

So. But even though I would try to be here again.

So today 's post was about light and darkness related to the eclipse today.

## Energy Work

So if you did n't read it , I recommend you to go there to the block and read it. And today we start with our crown chara of the emotional week.

So I 'm being so tired for sure it will help in the flow of the the. Of the explanations and so on. And I guess. I will be much more in the mood of emotion because I 'm so tired from all this days that I kind of think that eventually I will feel like sad and all this kind of things.

So.

So we have a lot of time to be in the middle of the week of lamina and being that week for sure will bring me something really weird.

So you will have to stand. As you will have to to. Just stand me because I 'm going to be where this way for sure.

## Daily Practice Elements

So I 'm going to be a little bit more in the middle of the week of lamina. The vibration for today is. That means energy. The statement for today is I am spiritual energy.

So of course I am very very tired so it 's important is impossible for me to guide something.

So we will do the alignment all together as one. I will do the alignment. And so.

So just think about the concepts for today. Related to the eclipse , slight darkness. And all the concepts that I just said. Hmm.

The vibration the energy. The spiritual energy sorry. See it 's comfortable. Close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing.
