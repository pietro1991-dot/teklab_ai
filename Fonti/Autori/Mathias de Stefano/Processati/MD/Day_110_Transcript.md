## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

Today we are in the Toro Day , closing the week of the emotions in the month of Scorpio.

So since today , of course we are logically talking inside the energy of Sagittarius , but for the next 10 days we will keep working with the physical aspects of this Scorpio.

So even though we are now in Sagittarius , we will have 10 more days in Scorpio. Our work.

So take a deep breath.

So as you may have seen the week with Scorpio has been all about going into the depths of our subconscious.

So it 's very heavy to go inside. But I would say that Scorpio is one of the most important moments that we are going to have because it 's kind of the depths of all the other concepts that we are going to speak about in the next month. All of them.

So I would recommend to be a lot of attention to Scorpio to be able to transcend and to integrate the rest of the year.

## Q&A

Some people were asking yesterday about what an engraver is and if the I am is an engraver. But I would say that an engraver would be an energy-ticled concept that takes spirit by itself from the creation of people or beings that are alive.

So we are the ones creating creating engravers from life towards the dimensions and the I am is not something that we create. The I am is a concept related to the divine.

So it 's otherwise.

So we could say that an engraver is like an energy-ticled notebook would say like , I do n't know , be ticker , you say in English , be ticker , be ticker , be ticker of a group of people.

So of course that with all this that we are doing we are creating also an engraver , of course. Yeah , so we are creating an engraver because an engraver is that , is how you say? Like a journal of the finale.

Okay , , of a group.

So of course there are good engravers by the engravers of everything.

So these beings are created by the concepts that we all share that a group of people share.

So what he meant by saying set myself free was to basically set yourself free from and he was a very easy and quiet engraver related to the christians. Hmm.

So the topic for today related to , to the torus , the motion of torus , is solitude or loneliness.

So the concept of of solitude comes from the from the idea of of being unique the only one , the only one. That 's solitude.

Solitude comes from the concept of solace that means the unique one , the only one. And this is the origin also for the word sun , that sun in English , it 's variation of the Latin word sol.

So first of all , let 's try to understand that the concept of solitude is not originated by the idea of being alone. It 's originated by the concept of being unique. One only being. That 's the concept of solitude.

First of all , to to understand this , we have to picture that that solitude must be seen in three different ways in our self , which is the mind , the soul , the emotional and the body.

So the first one would be the mental , the mind , which is related to the concept of solitude related to to be unique.

So that 's the concept of the mind. The mind says I am , and everything that is around me is just a perception , a projection of what I see , what I perceive , what I think.

So it 's not about being lonely , it 's about being the only. That would be the different. And in the mind , the self would say I am the only one. If the mind , if the mind thinks that the spiritual mind thinks that everything is unique , because it 's only one , the self , the I am.

So this means that that the mind is neutral. This is only one thing.

So the spirit perceive everything from the neutrality. The soul , the emotional , is energetic.

So this means that the neutrality of the spirit in the soul , in the emotion is split into positive and negative.

So this means that the soul is basically energy. And it means that the soul is related with the links and bounds with others. Positive , negative , positive , negative. It needs the links to perceive the unity.

So when some links go away , this will mean that the soul will perceive that unity through separation. And by the cut of the links , the only becomes lonely.

So we can understand it that way. For the soul , the only becomes lonely. Just to remind this , because I want , I want for everyone this to be very clear. This is the main division or difference.

Sorry , this is the main difference between spirit and soul. Spirit is the consciousness of unity. Everything is spirit. The spirit is one.

And the soul is the energy which is two different things , positive and negative , because it 's energy.

So it 's related with links.

So one is unity , the one is duality. And the soul is related with links. This is why the spirit is called I am and the soul is called we are.

So for the mind , for the spirit , everything is unity. Everything is one. It does n't understand the other one , because it does n't exist the other one , because everything is one. There 's only one mind , only one truth.

That 's why the spirit knows.

So this is why it says I am. And by saying I am , it is saying that it 's the only one that is the son that irradiates everything.

So it is unique. That 's the only concept of solitude that the spirit can understand , uniqueness.

So when the unity starts to violate and divide itself , create energy. When the unity starts to violate and divide itself , it creates energy because now we have a positive and the negative.

So two different things that start to move and create the energy. Everything starts to move.

So the soul is the energy that allows for everything to exist through energy.

So it creates the links , the bounds of movement , of creation.

So that 's the great difference between spirit and soul.

So if for the unity , for the spirit , the unity is the uniqueness. Is the only one , recognizes the only one.

So for the soul which is two different aspects , to be the only , which means that there is one of them missing. And that 's how it begins to idea of lonely. To be alone. Picture this , we have only one concept up there that is unity , the only one that divides into different energies.

And then , these two different energies are going to try to create a new one again , what we call the body , the Trinity.

So this energy will try to put everything together to create again the same concept of the origin.

So this will mean that the unity expressed in different energies and the energy starts to move until it can create the path to put all that together again and create unity again. This means that the body is the way in which the soul can leave an experience , the unity of the spirit.

So this is why the body is I and the spirit is I , looks for the am to say I am and the path to connect these two is the energy of the soul , by positive and negative.

So the spirit thinks I am the only one. The soul says I am the many and the body says I am the individual created by the many. For all the pure energy of the spirit to come to the body , we need duality. And now you get why we need duality and polarity because is the way of the soul.

Hmm? The spirit says I am the soul says I am in you and you are in me. And the body says it is me. You got the three different ways of saying it.

So for the spiritual mind there 's nothing else than itself. Then the I am then the only one So when we speak about the soul remember the soul it 's positive and negative.

So positive and negative means that the soul needs to move energy from one another to create. This is why the soul needs a lover , a friend , an enemy. It 's constantly something in which project itself with whom create realities all the time.

So when the soul feels that that person does n't exist that it goes away suddenly the soul feels lonely. Feels loneliness. There is nothing else. There is nothing more there to relate to.

Because the soul is living through and with the others. Hmm? And then the body is the final product of the soul. The soul is the one creating the body by energy.

So the soul is within the body. The soul is the energy creating the body. This means that everything that the body will leave will perceive and feel is the final product of all the links that the soul has created. Because it 's made up with that.

So now we can understand the speeds of how the consciousness works. The spirit is only one thing.

So for the mind of the spirit everything happens in just this. That 's it.

So it 's very fast because there is nowhere to go. There is no connections to do. Everything is there. For the soul we have duality.

So there is a process from one point to another. You have a path to take.

So there is a process to understand why from this happens that. And the body is the final product of all the times that you did this. All interconnected creating networks.

So the body will need a lot of time to figure from where these connections came from. Because it 's like a mess.

So this is why sometimes when we have a problem is easier to understand why in the mind is easy. Then we need a bit of more time to relate that projection that we have done in others to heal the soul. But then to process that in the body will take a lot of time. And this is because for for the spirit for the mind everything is just adults.

For the soul is a process of a line of polarity. And for the body is a conjunction of spot , dots and lines creating greed.

So it 's much more complex.

So as I said for the spirit is about uniqueness.

So I am the only one. For the soul duality. If you take one it 's loneliness.

Now we are going to explain that. And for the body is a constant path of feeling alone and with others alone and with others. Is a constant path of experiencing both.

So only through the body we can experience soul and spirit both together as one.

So from this point of view acknowledging that the body is the final product of soul and spirit. Both together. What we have to try to understand talking about loneliness solitude is from where are we feeling solitude. The spirit or the soul.

When we speak about the loneliness , the solitude of the soul is the one that we all know for sure. Because that 's the one that we usually feel. And this means polarity.

So this means that the loneliness of the soul is related with the feeling of void , with the feeling of feeling empty because there 's a lack of something. You are missing someone. You are in the need of another one of another part. That 's the most easiest way in which we can relate the loneliness of the soul.

When we are looking for something outside. In order to feel plainly , plainly. And that 's why when you have a lack of someone of something , you feel abandon to. We relate this feeling with being abandon.

And the solitude of the spirit is the solitude of feeling devoid then. But acknowledging that the void is yourself. The devoid is you are the origin of everything. Suddenly you have the power to do whatever you want.

Because you are the only one. You are the creative. To understand the solitude of the spirit , you have to experience it. It 's very difficult to explain it.

Because it 's something so overwhelmed that is impossible to explain. Did you have to perceive it? And someday you will. And remember this , you can not go from the body to the spirit like that.

There is a path. What was the path? The soul. The soul is the path.

So you can not go over the soul. The soul is the path to reach the spirit.

So you have to go through the solitude , through loneliness , through experiencing this lack of stuff , feeling abandon.

So when you do that , is the thing that I explained today in the blog. And this is my personal experience. Through my life , I have lived in this path of the soul. I have lived many moments of abandon and loneliness.

And all of those moments can be seen from two different points of view.

So I could take the negative part of this situation of abandon which is to abandon myself or the positive one would be to find myself.

So emotionally what we used to do when we feel abandon is immediately to abandon ourselves. And this is because we do n't have the because we think that without the other one , I am nothing.

Remember the soul. The soul things without this one. I do n't exist. I 'm alone.

So I just abandon myself and let everything like fall down.

So in the positive way instead of living yourself and abandon yourself to disappear what you do is to find yourself , to project yourself in a new idea , in a new environment , in a new situation with new people.

So now imagine this. If I am the positive and this is the negative and I am like this like a magnet , this will never change. This is perfect. Constantly.

So I have two different ways to move forward and to change. I have to change.

So the way in which I will change is if this one goes away. If this one goes away , abandoning , I feel alone. And suddenly , I go into another one immediately I add to a new one to a new different level. The other way in which you can move forward without feeling the abandon , feeling abandon is when you be in the positive and this one being the negative and you want to get away from that to evolve.

So you have to change your polarity. If you are positive , you change the negative.

So negative and negative can not join. Go away.

So immediately you go into the next one into a different one and you move forward. This movement will create like a NA chain.

So for example , this process that I just explained , we can put it more human in terms of a couple , for example.

Remember , these two people are positive and negative. And this positive and negative is not good and bad. It 's just positive and negative.

So this is a couple.

So now imagine that I am the positive and this person is the negative. But this person that is positive that is negative in this couple.

Now this person decides to change to transform itself , something happened. And I do n't want to change. I want to be exactly the same. But this person says , I can not stay like this.

So it changes and suddenly this one disappears. It goes away and I am still the same. This person that is here in positive , when this person loses the other one because this one lives because that person changed.

So this one being exactly the same becomes toxic because the energy , the soul , is feeling , receiving that there is a void. There is no one to feel that void. And that 's how the soul feels lonely.

Okay.

So the thing is that this one that is alone , this person that stays alone , if this person still believes that the other one was the complementary for him , for it.

So it loses a lot of energy and stay in this loneliness when the spirit knows that we are all one.

So the only way in which you can find yourself is not by waiting the energy of the other one that you met is by keep going , keep moving forward because if everything is one , so it does n't matter where you go and who you are with , you will find yourself.

So when friends , couples , partners , family , when they start to violate in the same energy , in the same vibration , positive , positive , negative , negative.

So it 's the moment when you need to keep moving to keep going.

Okay. To change. This is why the crisis and the moments of breaking relationships are not a failure , but they are n't the key to know that you are moving forward. Every relation that we have is basically explained exactly as an image of a proton and an electron.

So whenever you feel alone , you have to think about what is your next step. Information for today. The vibration for today is. .

. The goal for today is the unconscious expression. In the constant breathing of the cosmos , movement emerges. The wave , the vibration that boots , boost ideas to move like waves through spice , space time.

This is a movement without any purpose , a three-dance and improvisation that manifests in the press and expression , in the feelings , in following the wave and creating without any judgment nerve purpose. We usually call this projection as present.

So let 's go to the alignment. We begin by doing circles with the shoulders to relax the body. I 'm dying. Focus in my breathing.

I become aware of the light around me and also proud shines within me. I take into think about all the people that I know that are connected to me. Good and bad , poses in part of this once. All of them around me.

I observe all of them surrounded by the same light that emerges from me. I recognize that all of them are connected to my same body. It 's the body of my mind. In a great ocean of consciousness , where they now become waves.

Take a deep breath and dive within the waters , going through the conscience and the allen conscience. You perceive how the light starts to vanish. As you go deeper and deeper , falling into the depth of your subconscious , in the shadows on the darkness. I take a moment to perceive how I find myself in an infinite darkness alone.

## Guided Meditation

I take a moment. Breathe. I perceive what provokes in you. Disgrace , solitude.

I perceive what provokes in you. I perceive what provokes in you. I admire intention and I activated with my vibration. I desire to find myself in my solitude.

I am the sun. I perceive what provokes in you. I perceive what provokes in you. I am the eternal transformation.

I am the eternal transformation. Take a deep breath and go into the core of the void of your solitude within you. Expand the light of yourself. You are the 18 and you are eliminating all the subtle conscience as if you were the sun.

I take a deep breath , bringing my hands to my heart. Take a deep breath , receiving this light radiating. Bring clarity to each corner of the subconscious. Take a deep breath and go into the core of your solitude.

I acknowledge that I have to go to the depths of my dark soul to see the light. For its only in the night , the Jew can see how he shine. He is in the subconscious of my soul , where I find all the truth. You are not clever enough delist and you started to know about it.

Take the breath , the stars to bring this consciousness to each part of your body , your body , by cruising and stretching , coming back here and now.

So now remember that early looking for the truth , the answers , there is no other way than going down deep to the darkness of our soul. Thank you for being there and souls. See you tomorrow at the same time , to begin with the week of the body. Thank you.
