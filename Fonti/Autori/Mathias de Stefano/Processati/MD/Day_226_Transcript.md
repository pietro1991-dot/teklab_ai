## Overview

Today we explore empathy from its deepest etymological roots and understand why it has been the key concept for the last 2,000 years of human history—the Pisces era.

This is not just about feeling what others feel. It's about understanding the pain of existence, the weight of suffering, and how humanity learned to distribute that weight through empathy and sacrifice.

We are closing the Pisces era and entering Aquarius, the age of freedom. Understanding empathy in its historical context helps us transition from sacrifice based on suffering to sacrifice based on liberation.

## Etymology: Empathy vs. Sympathy vs. Apathy

### Empathy: To Be In the Pain

**Empathy** comes from two Greek words:
- **Em** = inside, in
- **Pathos** = pain, suffering

Empathy specifically means to be in the pain of others. To perceive the pain, to feel it as if it were your own.

This is not just understanding intellectually—it's feeling the pain directly.

### Sympathy: To Accompany the Pain

**Sympathy** comes from:
- **Sym** = with, together
- **Pathos** = pain

Sympathy means to accompany the pain of others, to share it, to go with them through their suffering.

Matias describes himself as more sympathetic than empathic: "I don't understand the pain or suffering of others. I don't really understand it. I can go with, share with. But I will try to make them laugh or whatever to help them feel better. Because I can't understand why they suffer."

Each person has different attributes. It's okay to be empathic, sympathetic, or somewhere in between.

### Apathy: To Not Feel

**Apathy** is the opposite of empathy:
- **A** = without, not
- **Pathos** = pain

Apathy means the inability to relate or feel. Apathetic people cannot connect with others' emotions or accompany them. They simply withdraw from contact.

### Antipathy: To Be Against

**Antipathy** means:
- **Anti** = against
- **Pathos** = pain

Antipathetic people don't just avoid feeling—they actively work against connection, often provoking pain because they don't care.

## Why Pisces Is the Empathy Sign

### The Last Sign of the Zodiac Wheel

Pisces is the 12th and final sign in the zodiac wheel. This means Pisces is the one who has walked the entire circle, experiencing all that the other 11 signs have gone through.

Because Pisces has been through all the experiences, Pisces can understand what each sign feels. Pisces can perceive, feel, and be in the pain of others because they were there already.

### Pisces Loves Everyone

The Pisces archetype loves everyone because they know what everyone has to go through. This creates deep intuition—Pisces can feel what others are feeling even when they're hiding it.

This is why Pisces people are:
- Good listeners
- Excellent advisors on deep matters of the mind and soul
- Connected to the spiritual world
- Drawn to psychology and psychiatry
- Sensitive to hidden realities and dreams

### Connecting to Trauma and Pain

Pisces is so sensitive and open to inner realities that they naturally connect with the deepest, hidden parts of ourselves—the trauma, the conflicts, the pains we carry within.

They can relate to painful memories and go to the specific painful aspects of the self that are awakened inside.

This creates the concept of empathy related to Pisces: feeling the suffering, connecting to pain.

## The Pisces Era: 2,000 Years of Suffering

### The Age of Pisces

The Pisces era began approximately 2,000-2,200 years ago and will end in the next 100-150 years.

The civilization and humanity we've experienced these past 2,000 years has been defined by suffering. Suffering was the main key during all this time.

### Etymology of Suffering

**Suffering** comes from Latin **super-ferre**:
- **Super** = under, below
- **Ferre** = to bear, to carry (iron)

Suffering means to carry a lot of weight, like iron on the heart of a person.

### Distributing the Weight

During this time of contemplating suffering, religions and cultures looked for empathy to contrast the suffering.

Empathy meant to share the weight, to distribute the heaviness of this iron over our heads so we could all keep moving, keep going.

The 2,000 years of the Pisces era were not about getting rid of suffering but about distributing the suffering so we could overcome it together.

The way to do this was by offering yourself—to help others hold the weight.

---

## Jesus and the Transformation of Sacrifice

### The First Recorded Self-Sacrifice

The first person we have recorded who offered himself to hold the suffering of all others was the teacher, the master: Jesus Christ.

What Jesus did was take the ancient concept of sacrifice (ceremonies using animals to make offerings to the divine) and transform it completely.

Instead of offering an animal, he offered himself.

This changed the concept for the next 2,000 years, symbolizing the beginning of the Pisces era.

### Etymology of Sacrifice

**Sacrifice** comes from two European roots that sound unfortunate in English:
- **Sac** (or **Sacro**) = to channel the divine into the physical
- **Fic** (from **facere**) = to do, to make

**Sacrifice** originally meant to do something holy, to channel the divine into matter through action—a ceremony.

In ancient times, these ceremonies used blood. They killed animals to make offerings to the gods, to the ground, to the earth.

This is why we relate sacrifice with suffering, killing, pouring blood. But not all sacrifices required blood—it was just a common tradition.

### Jesus Changes the Paradigm

When Jesus appeared, he stopped the idea of sacrificing external things (animals) to the gods.

He turned it inward: the sacrifice is to offer yourself as an aware being for the good of everyone, becoming a portal as a child of God.

This shifted from the Age of Aries ("kill them all") to the Age of Pisces ("I offer myself for the rest").

He said:
- Don't take the blood of animals—drink my blood
- Don't eat those animals—eat my flesh, my body

This concept of drinking Jesus's blood and eating his body represented the idea that the only being that must be offered to God is yourself, because you are God.

It's not giving something unaware (like an animal) as a gift. It's giving yourself as proof that you are holy.

### The Message Spreads and Changes

Jesus's messengers (Evangelists—"new message" in Greek) spread the teachings, but each region adapted the message to their own cultures and religions.

The Nordic people changed the idea. Mediterranean people changed it. They mixed in images of solstices and equinoxes, blending all religions and cultures.

The story we hear today about Jesus is probably 80-90% wrong because most of it is other stories mixed into his image.

But one thing is certain: it's been 2,000 years and we're still talking about him.

### The Name "Jesus"

The name "Jesus" comes from **Yeshua**, which means "the Savior" in Hebrew.

"Jesus Christ" means:
- **Jesus** (Yeshua) = the salvation
- **Christ** (Greek: Christos) = the chosen one, the anointed

These aren't personal names—they're titles, concepts. They describe what this person represented to people of that time.

## Empathy and Christianity

### 2,000 Years of Empathy as Survival

The concept of empathy became fundamental to the 2,000 years of the Pisces era.

Suffering was so immense that we needed to hold it through empathy:
- Helping others
- Being servants to other humans
- Serving others
- Loving others as you would love to be loved

This distributed the pain and helped those suffering the most to carry the burden of their own crosses.

### We Are the New Sacrifice

Throughout history, when Christianity started, we took the idea that we have to suffer to make a sacrifice.

We became the new sacrificial animals. We are the new lambs.

We must sacrifice (suffer) to show others that we're willing to help them by our suffering.

This concept of empathy is born from Christianity—empathy as pain, empathy as sacrifice through suffering.

## The Shift: From Pisces to Aquarius

### Empathy No Longer Means Suffering

Now this concept of empathy, born from Christianity and the Pisces era, no longer has the same meaning.

We are entering the **Age of Aquarius**, the age of freedom.

We are no longer like Pisces, willing to feel everyone's pain and hold everyone's weight.

We are entering the age of freedom.

### The New Sacrifice: Freedom

Now the concept of empathy must be taught not by the sacrifice of pain and suffering, but by the **sacrifice of freedom**.

The sacrifice is to give everything to help people set themselves free from the weight of the cross.

This is the new time.

### Learning from the Pisces Era

The 2,000 years of the Pisces era taught us about empathy:
- How to understand the suffering of others
- How to go into the depth and darkness of the soul
- How to be in the place of others
- How to relate to others through wars, conflicts, pain

We needed to understand how it feels, to live all that, to be in that place—so we could now become free.

### The Message of Jesus for the Pisces Era

The teachings of Jesus were how to be empathic in the time of Pisces.

His teachings are still useful for those who need to learn empathy in the Pisces age. Because we will not be able to enter the freedom of the new time without being empathic to the suffering of the previous era.

The teachings from 2,000 years ago were for the environment of 2,000 years ago—for an era that needed to be very empathic.

### Looking 2,000 Years Ahead

The question now is: how will they see us in 2,000 years more?

Are we doing our sacrifice right?

## Practice

Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Feel the energy moving through your entire body—to each organ, muscle, each cell.

Feel the magnetism, the hot and cold expanding energy. Recognize this energy as your emotions.

Take a deep breath. Allow these emotions to expand throughout your entire body, dissolving to the infinite like drops of water filling an ocean.

Perceive in this ocean the pain, the conflicts, all that you carry.

Open yourself to feel—to perceive the textures, smells, colors, flavors. Feel the emotions connected to these senses, the people connected to these emotions.

Take a deep breath and become aware that all of this that you feel, that you perceive, is a part of yourself.

As wider you open yourself to feel, the more you expand, connected to the network.

Recognize that this sensitivity, this capacity, allows you to take all that is expanded of you throughout the cosmos and manifest it here and now.

Take a deep breath, bringing all this sensitivity, this capacity of manifestation, and put your sensitivity toward yourself. Activate it within with your vibration.

Sound the vibration **Huge** from your sacral chakra.

**I am the will that creates. I am the will that creates.**

**I believe in what I feel.**

Breathe deeply. Bring this consciousness to each part of your body.

## Integration

Today, reflect on how you relate to others' pain. Are you empathic (feeling their pain directly), sympathetic (accompanying them), apathic (disconnected), or antipathic (against)?

There's no right answer—each has its place. But understanding your natural tendency helps you know how to serve others and when to protect your own energy.

As we transition from Pisces to Aquarius, ask yourself: How can I help others become free rather than just sharing their suffering?

The old paradigm was: "I will suffer with you." The new paradigm is: "I will help you become free from suffering."

---

## Week Context

We are in the Physical Week of Pisces, working with the body's relationship to empathy, sacrifice, and the transition from the age of suffering to the age of freedom.

The sacral chakra (today's focus) is where we create, where we channel divine energy into physical manifestation—the original meaning of sacrifice.

## Q&A

### Q: If empathy means feeling others' pain, isn't that exhausting?

Yes, which is why the Pisces era was defined by suffering. But we're transitioning to Aquarius, where the goal is not to feel everyone's pain but to help everyone become free. You can help without absorbing all suffering.

### Q: Is sympathy better than empathy?

Neither is better—they're different tools. Empathy allows deep understanding. Sympathy allows companionship without overwhelm. Know which you naturally are and use it consciously.

### Q: Why did Jesus have to suffer to change the sacrifice paradigm?

He didn't have to suffer—he chose to demonstrate that sacrifice is offering yourself (your awareness, your divinity) not external things. The suffering came from the resistance of the old paradigm.

### Q: How do we sacrifice for freedom instead of suffering?

Give your energy, your wisdom, your presence to help others wake up and become free. Don't just share their pain—show them the way out of it.

### Q: If most of the Jesus story is mixed with other traditions, what's true?

The essence: offering yourself as divine, distributing the weight of suffering through love, teaching empathy. The details may be mixed, but the core message survived 2,000 years.

### Q: How do I know if I'm ready for the Age of Aquarius?

If you can be empathic to the Pisces era's suffering without getting lost in it, and if you're focused on freedom rather than just sharing pain, you're transitioning well.
