## Overview

Today we explore **advance**—the perpetual forward movement that defines life itself.

Yesterday we learned that **independence** is the conscious choice of dependencies.

Today we discover that **advancement** is the constant process of releasing dependency on the past and moving toward the future.

**Life is always advancing. The question is: Are you?**

## Core Teaching

### The Foundation from Independence

Yesterday we established: Independence equals not hanging from above.

Someone is dependent when attached to people, conditioned by past events, hanging from previous situations, or when energy depends on external sources.

Someone becomes independent when they transcend connections from the past, move forward, transform, and evolve.

But here's the truth: We will always be dependent on something.

Even when we become independent, we immediately depend on new things: food, sleep, water when thirsty, air, environment, interaction with others.

The entire creation is a network. Everything is connected. The only way something can exist is because it's held by the environment.

In essence, we are dependent on something. Always.

### Etymology of Advance

Advance comes from Latin:

Ad = to, toward

Ante = in front, before something

Advance equals to move toward what's in front, toward what's before something.

It shows us the next step, the future.

### The Timeline: Past, Present, Future

Imagine a timeline: [PAST] <---- [PRESENT (You)] ----> [FUTURE]

From present toward future: Seeking independence (moving forward, evolving)

From present toward past: Living in dependence (attached to what was)

Everything we are physically, emotionally, and mentally is a projection of everything that happened before. We are hanging from the past.

Physical body: Dependent on genealogical/biological history (cells evolved over thousands of years)

Emotional body: Dependent on emotional history (family bonds, traumas, experiences)

Mental body: Dependent on mental history (beliefs, education, conditioning)

We hang from that tree.

### Three Levels of Dependence on the Past

Subconscious - Physical: Your body's biological design. Whatever you want to do with your body depends on your physical and biological history. Your cells have been improving through thousands of years to develop eating, sleeping, all biological processes. You are hanging from the genealogical/biological tree in your subconscious.

Unconscious - Emotional: Your emotional patterns and bonds. Your emotions depend on things you've lived throughout your family, your emotional bonds with people, traumatic experiences, happy experiences, feelings from your genealogical tree. All of this is in the unconscious. Your emotions depend on what you and your ancestors have felt. You are hanging from the emotional tree in your unconscious.

Conscious - Mental: Your beliefs, thoughts, and perspectives. Your mind depends on ancestors' beliefs, your own life experiences, and what you've been taught. Important clarification: To be conscious does not equal to be enlightened. To be conscious equals to think about something and determine the environment according to what you believe. Example: A very religious person who says "You committed a sin, you'll go to hell" is also conscious—they believe it, think about it, and apply it. Consciousness can be wise or unwise. It just means you're aware and choosing based on what you know. You are hanging from the mental tree in your consciousness.

### Seeking Independence = Working for Consciousness

When we say "We're working for the consciousness of the planet," it doesn't mean we're working to enlighten the planet.

It means we're working so the planet can THINK and DETERMINE its own future based on awareness.

Consciousness is the capacity to think, decide, and act based on awareness.

Whether that awareness is "spiritual" or "religious" or "scientific"—it's still consciousness if it's aware and choosing.

To become independent equals to become conscious of what you're dependent on, so you can choose your dependencies rather than unconsciously hang from them.

### Advance: The Constant Movement

"It depends" is something we say constantly without understanding what it means.

When you say "It depends," you're saying something you do is related to a specific structure, and the answer depends on a reality, emotion, or decision.

The difference between dependence and independence is the DECISION you make on those things that depend.

If we'll always be dependent on something, what word helps us understand why we follow the concept of independence?

ADVANCE.

The process of getting independent from something is the constant. We need to advance. We need to move forward.

### Subconscious, Unconscious, Conscious: How Each Advances

Subconscious (Physical): Dependence on biology, genetics, cellular programming. You cannot fully control this. But you can become aware of how your body works, what it needs, and work with it rather than against it. Hard work in yourself can shift some subconscious patterns to conscious choice.

Unconscious (Emotional): Dependence on emotions, attachments, fears. Emotional attachments link you to the past. When you don't feel able to transcend, you get stuck. To advance: Become aware of the emotions, recognize the attachments, and consciously choose to transcend. You may still have the emotion, but you're not controlled by it.

Conscious (Mental): Dependence on beliefs, thoughts, conditioning. How to advance: Choice. When you know you can let something go, you move forward, evolve, change, transform, transcend.

### The Practice: Keep Moving Forward

"The only thing that makes us believe we are not moving forward is that we are watching behind."

Life is always advancing. Time doesn't stop. Space expands.

Advancing is a constant in the universe—like time and space.

When things change, we have two choices:

1. Attach to the forms of what it was (live in the past - dependence)
2. Adapt to the things that come ahead (live in the future - independence through advancement)

### Matias' Personal Example

Matias describes how his entire schedule for the year was planned (traveling the world, events, etc.).

Then everything changed. He had to adapt in 3 days to a completely different reality: staying home, teaching online daily.

"Sometimes the biggest things are made with the simple things. You just have to keep moving by adapting to the new forms."

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Become aware of breath, body, space.

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark. Bring this light to your ankles.

### Main Practice

See the timeline: [PAST] <---- [YOU] ----> [FUTURE]

Feel yourself hanging from the past: physical dependencies (body, genetics), emotional dependencies (attachments, fears), mental dependencies (beliefs, conditioning).

Now consciously turn toward the future. Not because the past is bad—but because life moves forward. Choose to advance.

Sound: Rü

I am free wisdom. I am free wisdom. I am free wisdom.

I am. I am. I am.

Crown Through Ankles: In each chakra, feel: "I release dependence on the past. I choose to advance."

Crown: Advance in ideas

Third Eye: Advance in perception

Throat: Advance in truth

Heart: Advance in feeling

Solar Plexus: Advance in being

Sacral: Advance in creation

Root: Advance in reality

Knees: Advance beyond ancestral patterns

Ankles: Advance on the path

### Closing

Recognize: Life is always advancing. The universe expands. Time moves forward. Evolution continues.

You are free when you advance with it, rather than clinging to what was.

Breathe deeply. Stretch. Yawn. Return to here and now.

- Independence (from yesterday) = conscious choice of dependencies; but we'll always depend on something
- From present toward future = seeking independence (evolution); from present toward past = living in dependence (attachment)
- We are physically, emotionally, and mentally projections of the past—we hang from that history
- Three levels of past dependence: Subconscious (biological/physical), Unconscious (emotional/bonds), Conscious (mental/beliefs)
- Subconscious: Body depends on genealogical/biological tree (cells, eating, sleeping)
- Unconscious: Emotions depend on family history, bonds, traumas, experiences from ancestors
- Conscious does not equal enlightened; Conscious = aware and choosing based on what you believe/think
- "Working for consciousness of planet" = working so planet can THINK and DECIDE its future based on awareness
- "It depends" = acknowledging that decisions are related to specific structures/realities
- The process of getting independent (the constant) = ADVANCE
- Advancing is a universal constant like time and space—life always moves forward
- Attachment to forms of the past = living in past; Adaptation to what comes ahead = living in future
- Matias' example: Had to adapt entire year's plan in 3 days—advancement through adaptation

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

When you face change today, notice your reaction:

Do you cling to "how it was"? (Looking backward, dependence)

Or do you adapt to "how it is becoming"? (Looking forward, advancement)

### The Adaptation Practice

Choose one thing that's changing in your life right now.

Ask:
1. **What am I attached to from the past?** (The old form)
2. **What's emerging in the future?** (The new form)
3. **Can I release the past and advance into what's coming?**

**This is freedom wisdom.**

### Simple Truth

"When things change, we have to adapt and move forward. If we are attached to the forms of what it was, we live in the past. If we adapt to the things that come ahead, we live in the future."

**Simple. Not easy. But simple.**

## Q&A

### Q: How can I advance if I'm stuck emotionally in the past?

Recognize that being stuck is **unconscious** dependence. To advance: Become **conscious** of the attachment, feel it fully, then **choose** to move forward. The emotion may remain, but you're not controlled by it.

### Q: What if advancing means losing important connections?

Advancing doesn't mean **abandoning** the past. It means **not being controlled** by it. You can honor your history while moving forward. The tree doesn't abandon its roots when it grows new branches.

### Q: How do I know if I'm advancing or just running away?

Advancing = conscious choice to move toward something. Running away = reactive escape from something. Ask: "Am I moving TOWARD growth, or just AWAY FROM discomfort?"

### Q: Is it possible to advance without changing everything?

Yes. Advancement is often **internal** before it's external. You can advance in **consciousness** (how you think), **emotion** (how you feel), or **spirit** (what you value) before anything changes physically.

### Q: What's the relationship between yesterday's "Independence" and today's "Advance"?

Independence = conscious choice of dependencies (static state). Advance = the constant movement of choosing new dependencies as you evolve (dynamic process). You advance BY choosing independence repeatedly.

### Q: Can the subconscious (biological) level ever advance?

Slowly, over generations. Your choices today affect your descendants' biology (epigenetics). But individually, you can bring subconscious patterns to consciousness through deep work.

### Q: Why is "free wisdom" the statement for advance?

Because you're free when you **advance with life** rather than cling to the past. Freedom isn't independence from all dependencies—it's wisdom to advance through them.
