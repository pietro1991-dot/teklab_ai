## Introduction

Hello everyone , good afternoon of evening. How are you?

So I 'm as before with that day. I just suddenly felt so , so tired. And a few minutes ago , I 'm like closing my eyes like this. I almost get in a sleep.

So , I 'm really sleepy.

So , I do n't know , how it 's going to be. But if I get asleep , so do n't worry.

So , let 's go to the scrum with our top of the food today , which is rip rium.

Okay , so let 's remember what is the meaning of the word reproduction.

So , remember all this , the meaning of rip citation. Rep , re , that means , and , Pro , that means towards Duke , that comes from Deere , meaning take or to guide. It 's the same word for education , Duke , education.

So , the meaning of rip citation would mean to the addition , taking or guiding something ahead again , that would be the meaning of rip citation.

So , the word reproduction actually is talking about production. It is not talking about reaction. Read the word re in front of that word is talking about the repetition of something in an actual expression. Once again , repeating once over and over again.

So , we take , we can understand what is the concept that is repeating over again.

So , that is the production , production to produce something.

So , production is telling about the action of something which is a product. And that product must be productive , which is the attribute of production.

So , what is the concept that we are talking about to produce , produce is to bring something ahead. To guide that something to follow in the path ahead.

So , what are we bringing ahead a different of course? And what is the product? The product is moving ahead in order to be productive , in which we make this thing , this product , productive is through the action that we call production. And the verb to do that is to produce.

Production.

Today in our current day we have the concept of production as something related to economy.

Something related to the production of things like for example , this pen.

So , I am producing this thing.

So , in order to get product , I have to follow a process which is the production , taking the main elements to make this pen until I reach it.

So , then I have the product which is , and then I use it and I do something productive with it.

Okay , so that would for us the concept of production.

So , we can also name the production or a person that is productive from within.

So , the emotional concept of production.

So , that would be like for example , a person that is manifest in something that is within , because remember produce is to bring something ahead.

So , actually when a person is productive is the person that has within a lot of that are manifested and brought to the outside.

So , it is useful in the outer world.

So , to produce is usually related to something that is useful.

So , it is useful because the things that we produce are related to the manifestation , to the practical things. That 's why it is related with the useful things , with the things that we use the time.

So , that would be the reason why we relate production with physical aspects , with physical things.

So , we have been seen production from the human point of view , but now we have to understand that me and I am also a product that has to , that has gone through a process of production in order to exist. The production process of human human , surge in the moment of the concept. When a person is born and a person is born , a person is born with a genetic character , a human , intercommunication , and a human being. And from the new months of production , the final product , Nascar.

So , we can say now that a human is also product and how was the process that it took in order to be this product that we are now? Well , the path of production of a human begins when an is promulgated and an egg , oval , got together and they exchange data and they exchange , they start to multiply cells and create organisms that develop themselves for nine months in a long process of production until the product is born.

So , we can see the concept of produce when the cells , the eggs and the sperm parasites , they get out from a place to go into another. That is for a done de produce is to go from one to the other. A head moving forward. And then the cells start to multiply this meaning they bring the information to one another.

So , there 's keep bringing data and there 's one day that we are born , which is to go from the uterus away into the outside.

So , we go out , which is to produce to.

## Q&A

So , now that we understand the product , we have to ask ourselves , what is what produce , what produce , what we are. That thing that produce , what we are , is the NA exchange data.

So , it absorbs energy from the from the environment in order to multiply the codes of the NA , to create more cells to replicate that same information.

So , they start to produce cells , the main cells produce cells.

So , what actually is happening in a body , produce a body , is that the molecules that compose the NA , these two are to create environments like a cell in order to absorb the information , the energy from the outside , the energy from the outside. In order to replicate themselves in thousands of cells that will trespass this data once and again , once and again in each one of the cells. The thing is that a cell , the information of a cell , is a constant production of information , which the concept would be a production information. What this means that everything that itself is doing is to try to bring out into the next cell , all the data that has within.

And the word formation means exactly that something that is being formed constantly once and again. Is a constant process of taking shape and forms. That 's what information means.

So , the same aspect of formation of matter is the information , the data taking shape.

So , that 's a constant process , the turn-out process. And how does this information goes through time and space? Well , what it has to do is to produce itself once and again , which is to bring the data from within and express it into the next one outside. Taking all information in the next one , the next one , the next one.

So , this process of production. This process of production repeats itself so many times that that 's why we call it re-production.

Now , to get this idea of the information , remember that concept of information is a constant in the universe. The information is something that goes through two constant in the universe , which is time and space. Time and space are the two things that goes through everything because they are constant. We can speak here about the relativity of time and space , of course , but even though they are constant.

And what is this two constants doing? Concently , information. They are taking shape in different dimensions and realities.

So , that 's why what we know through this constant is that there is a lot of data like the mind of the universe , exchanging constant information all the time. And that 's why it 's information because it 's transforming itself in many forms , many shapes , ones and again.

So , because of this , because of this , we can understand that the inner-genic realities and the organic realities , what they are doing is basically to send information through time and space. They transform themselves through thousands and millions of years , but they are just doing an exchange of information moving forward.

Okay?

So , it 's constant. That 's eternity.

So , in our bodies , like the physical bodies , they do exactly the same.

So , the cells are trying to bring that data into the next cell , so the information goes on and on. And that 's what we call evolution. They are transforming , ones need just trans-spassing data.

So , actually , where we can understand here is that in the microcosmos in the subtopic realm , the intuition , the data is the only thing that exists and that is constant eternity.

So , the microcosmos , the physical things that we see , are just the shapes , that data takes and forms in order to find different ways.

So , to trans-spass this energy , this information in a better way. That 's evolution , basically , that 's what evolution is.

So , this is why we can understand here that the universe is only information , just data , information. And this is why the constant in the universe is to be in formation , in constant formation. Let 's say.

So , we can say that one and the first existence in the universe is the one that produce everything that exists in the universe. And that exists around and extend a network of times to reach much more information through experience. And that 's why it replicate one and again , one and again , which is to reproduce , it starts to reproduce. And as you see , I did n't spoke about sex until now.

It 's just nonsense.

So , I know that some people are like , like , busy , like willing to know what about the kids and the son and to have sex or whatever , just take a deep breath , because if you do n't get this , what I said before , you 're not going to get what I 'm going to say next.

So , what I was saying is that the reproduction is the one that explains how every atom , every molecule , every chemical , they just start to replicate their shapes in order to keep everything that data and that information.

So , we start to create a universe , a universe made up with fact , let 's remember what is the fractal.

So , this would be fractalization. Once triangle that I put another one in the middle , I replicate the shape. How many triangles do I have now? Ten , five.

One , two , three , four is five.

So , now I have five. I 've triangles. One bigger , one in the center and another three here. If I keep doing this in the same way , so I will make many other triangles.

So , if I keep doing that , once again.

So , what is happening here with the fractalization is that this same triangle is constantly the same. The triangle never here. It multiplied itself , my thousands and many.

So , the only one triangle , the only one that 's an information , just starts to replicate once again , once again.

So , it has many other points of view. It is instead of a triangle I have spheres , we 'll have it exactly the same.

So , in the same way as a triangle , we can put spheres.

So , the spheres also start to divide them. And they start to create this fractalization that we can call cells. And the cells , by my office and we thought this divide once again , once again , has a fractal , creating new data.

So , now here , the exactly as the triangles means like patterns here.

So , the patterns starts to replicate themselves and once again.

So , they start to replicate once again.

So , the same codes that are inside , they will replicate.

So , that data information in each one of the cells will be multiplied too. But , it will be new data because not only has the old one , but also has new perspectives.

So , the thing is that these triangles here , they multiply once again once again the same data. And they try to make much more information , much more data. But , there is a moment that when you replicate the same data once again once again over. What happens is that it kind of distort the information gets distorted.

Like , for example , the letters , we spoke about the letters a few videos ago or months ago , I do n't know. We spoke about this , like the origin of the letter A that we have here , the origin was here in Abyss , Abyss , the name of the bull.

So , they draw this beautiful bull here , but then they start to change. And the distortion of the letter to alpha and then change it until the Romans did the A and we have the letter A now.

So , it 's the same sound , the same letter from thousands of years , but it changed a lot.

So , we do n't know exactly what happened here , why exist till it 's A.

So , the same thing happened in the body. The cell starts to reproduce the same information once again and they start to get distorted. And when they start to get distorted , the cells start to die. They say , I can not hold this anymore because I have no idea what I 'm doing.

Okay , it loose the meaning.

So , that 's why what that being has to do is two things. Or whether it divides itself to create a new one that can regenerate new things , or it can get to it with another one to create a third one that could make much more better information.

So , if they ca n't one part of itself to create a new one , is what we call as sexual way of reproduction. Or if you get together with another one to create a third one , that 's what we call sexual reproduction.

Remember , what is sex in order to understand as sexual? Sex means , comes towards sexual. Sector means divided to section to sectarian something. Sectorize something to divide something is to say , this is good , this is bad , this is big , this is small , feminine and masculine men , woman.

To sectarian the things , to divide the things.

So , eventually , in the language , they started to divide people through the genitalia.

So , they divided by masculine genitals and feminine genitals. And that 's what , and that was called the sex of a person. That 's the origin of the word.

So , as sexual would be , for example , to say someone that is not as sexual is someone that does n't get the idea of separation of feminine and masculine.

So , it does n't see the relation of it.

So , it also does n't get the idea of sexual organs because it 's not divided.

So , which means are as sexual? Well , for example , the plants , bacteria , virus , cells , how to say sea stars? The stars from the sea? There would be.

So , okay , so that would be the beings that reproduce by themselves without the need of genitals. Starfish , thank you , starfish. The starfish also is as sexual.

So , who are the sexual? The ones that use the feminine and the masculine that use the genitalia in order to produce another being. Just , I will give you some advice. I 'm not speaking here about ethics or morality and speaking only about biology here , the system.

So , what does the reproduction? That takes this triangle from this one and put it in the tattoo.

So , what the reproduction does? That takes this triangle , the blue triangle from here to out here and this triangle from here to out to be here. This means that the data from one from this one , from that one , creates a new one. And that would mean that this one here has a very much improved data than the other one.

So , this means that in evolution the sexual reproduction helped biology , helped information to improve the system faster and better. Incorporating much more data than before.

So , basically , this is why , if you see bacteria virus , they evolved but they have the same shape constantly. They have been thousands and millions of years kind of the same. And the plants also , they take millions of years and they kind of seem to want another still. But once the reproduce with sex , they change constantly , they transform themselves like reptilians , birds , mammals , which change constantly faster , much more data.

What we have here that suddenly , they start to multiply and try to exchange much more data and faster they get faster and faster and faster and faster. They reproduce with different prototypes , the better the information it is.

So , they start to get much more data , much more information , once and again.

So , it reaches the most in the months and the birds that we start to share emotions. That that 's our three emotions taking care of the one loving the other one in service of the other ones. And from there comes their homicide , creating cultures to exchange data. And then we improved as humans within the homicide.

## Guided Meditation

We improved exchanging data through civilization , language , arts , philosophy , rage and so eventually humans starts to discover what they are doing. Discover a way to exchange data also through technology through science through meditation. Eventually through the human evolution , we reach a point in which there is no specific need of having a sexual reproduction in order to share data and to move forward. There 's no need to create a third being a baby in order to keep sharing the information.

As the humans with the culture , linguistics , technology , we start to discover it from ways to exchange that data by creating projects , creating arts , doing something that we love. And being a teacher , doing something that shares with others that is productive for others.

So your own information keeps going on. This is why some of us maybe need to have kids.

Some others do n't have. But we all even though as the human have the opportunity to reproduce.

## Q&A

So , and each one of you will discover which is your own way of reproduction , maybe a right in the book. Doing a play. Sharing with others. I know that from this we have many questions and we can speak about so many branches and so many things that it would be too much.

But I guess that within I wanted to give you the basis of the data. We can kind of have the the fundamentals of this and eventually someday when we start to. When we start to. To do.

Some. Questions and answers maybe more in the future related to the videos that I did this year. And I maybe can answer some of the questions. I hope to do that.

## Daily Practice Elements

And of course I invite you to try to own questions with this basement. Let 's go to the information for today. If I were to day is who. The statement for today is I am the designer of creation.

I become aware of the environment that surrounds me. The body that I have it and my own breathing. And I have served under my feet. The lion 's sense of my body in the shape of a divine spark.

A breath and a night is spark. I ascend this divine spark to my feet. Inside. Inside.

Shading path. To the to the in my feet. Starting the blue and wide rivers to the legs. And I ascend in tension.

To expand. In property. All the data that is within me. To multiply my path.

I ignite my feet. I rise this divine spark to my knees. I recognize this two rivers. I am the one that is feminine in the masculine path.

My knees. And I ascending tension. To reproduce. All the things that are within me towards the future.

## Guided Meditation

And breathe in the night my knees. I ascend this spark to my root chara. And I recognize the leg of the vital energy. I ascend in tension.

## Energy Work

To reproduce. My will in order to test in the world. To make my projects a reality. I recognize and ignite my roots.

I ascend this divine spark to the scrum. I recognize the creative power within me. From the darkness and the lights. The radiation.

I ascending tension. To reproduce. To the world. I create a potential.

## Guided Meditation

I breathe and ignite the scrum. I am the one that is feminine. I am the one that is feminine. I recognize within my places.

I am the one that is feminine. I ascending tension. To reproduce. I breathe and ignite the scrum.

I breathe and ignite the scrum. I rise up to my vibration. I rise up to my heart. I recognize within me that 's the temple of life and love.

I am the one that is feminine. I ascending tension. To reproduce. I embrace and ignite my heart.

I rise up to the flow of the night within me towards the throat. I recognize the temple of the sun. I be it in the race of light of truth to all the world. I ascending tension.

To reproduce. In the world. I breathe and ignite the scrum. I rise this far to the third eye.

I observe the eyes of the same constant play to me. I ascending tension. I am the one that is feminine. I rise up to my third eye.

I rise up to my crown. I observe this not expanding the full delta in my crown. I breathe and ignite the crown. I can see how I reproduce in every all the parts that creates me.

I recognize myself as a sign of which I am. I am the one that is feminine. I am the sign of creation. I am the sign of creation.

I am the sign of creation. Thank you.
