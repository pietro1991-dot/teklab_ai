## Introduction

Hi everybody , how are you? Good morning , good evening , good afternoon. I am not the best with this thing of lights and cameras , so it will always be different. It smells like something is burning , but again , it 's not here.

If you see me running away , it 's because something is burning around. If you see me , we are face is because today I am really tired and I am headache too.

## Energy Work

So because of this , I would say the same as always , I do n't later , which is I would try to be short. It is really burning , so it 's smelling. I have the crown chara connect to 20. I am not really tuned today , so do n't expect much from me.

So just to let you know that this day is I was trying to be inside of myself , concentrated within me. Through my life , when I am going into that process , I used to paint the earth.

So I started to paint the earth and it helped me to concentrate myself and to be focused.

So I was doing this this days , because I was watching very close to something really tiny. My eyes hurt a little bit , that 's why I am headache. But also that 's why I am a little bit lost , the same all the time with the earth. I am a little bit lost , because I am a little bit lost , because I am focusing on that.

Sometimes I am watching like this , because I love to see it. I do n't know , I know there are a lot of people willing to go to another dimensions , but the people that came from other dimensions , we loved here , it is so beautiful and so funny.

So I do n't know , it 's like turkey.

So we are in today in the fourth law of the universe , which is rhythm , rhythm.

Remember that rhythm is connected to the heart , to the heart chara.

Now that I have blackboard , I will use it. I do n't know what happened to the color. This is one of the , yeah , that 's myself.

So taking the idea of yesterday , this is a wave of vibration , but this is a wave of vibration seen from the second dimension. This is 2D , 2 dimensions , because if we want to understand how the waves are moving really , we have to see it like if we are inside the wall. And so the water , we see everything moving , like constantly moving like this , with many waves everywhere.

So it 's not just one line.

So this would be like kind of a transverse cut of the three dimensional reality of a wave. And there you have this shape.

So as the oceans and the seas in the planet , the waves are all connected. All the oceans are connected like one. We can not say from here , we can not cut and say here starts one and ends the other one. No , it 's all connected.

So we call it by a region like this , the like oceans , but all the water in the whole planet is all connected without beginning and without end is a constant cycle. That 's why we can understand that in the universe everything is like a kind of an ocean that connects everything that makes everything to be one.

So comparing the universe with water , we would say that the water is always the same , it 's always water , even if you water in three different states like gas , solid and liquid.

So you can find the water in these three different waves all around the cosmos all around the world.

So the seven laws are kind of these three ways in which you can find the , so the seven laws are the states of the water which is the universe.

So they are all given in the same time. That 's why all the laws affect all the water because basically they made water what you did.

The reason why I say this is for what we have been speaking yesterday that all the laws are born in the same.

So the reason why I say the fourth law of the universe is not because it appeared after the third one is because we are trying to organize it according to our charts in the order of our charts.

Okay , so that 's why it 's the fourth. Once that this we will understand that the law of rhythm is just another aspect or point of view from the law of vibration and the law of vibration is a point of view of the law of correspondence.

So first of all , it 's try to understand what is rhythm. Rhythm comes from the world , from the word flow in Greek.

So rhythm means the flow and also gives origin to the word river.

So in our point of view rhythm is the thing that helps us to understand the continuity of things like the heartbeat to the tune. Like this. Is a pulse that tells us what is going to come next.

So that 's why we can know way before it happens but it 's going on. The rhythm would be this thing that helps us to understand from where we come from and where we are heading to. That 's why we also call it the time like in music the tempo.

So the tempo would be like this steps that you follow to understand the logic of music.

So remember that in music we have this whole energy that we rhythm and melody and rhythm would be like the metric , the measurement of the duration each one of the sounds and the repetitions like pulses of the music. Then we have the harm that would be the all the rest of the logic of the music like the instrument how they play in which moment. The order of it 's frequency the her the chords everything and then the melody which is the music itself where we used to sing to listen the most known part of the music.

So the melody and the harmony would n't have any sense without the rhythm which is the one that shows the tempo the moments in which you have to. To to put that music.

So we would say that rhythm is equal time.

So.

Remember what is the other way in which we will know time like this if all this is vibration so this is frequency.

So remember. The vibration is the whole wave of vibration is the whole wave and the frequency is the time that it takes for one of these curves to repeat again.

So as higher the vibration. The higher the frequency. As lower the vibration the lower the frequency.

So. If we see this. Through music we would say that all this is melody.

Okay , because it 's like the melody is over what you hear from everything. The harmony would be the balance between the different parts. Yeah , that 's balanced. And then.

Each repetition. Would be the rhythm.

So.

So this would be the rhythm. To to to to to. And then the harmony would be the instruments starting to play in balance. And then the melody that we create the whole music.

So now let 's go. Even deeper. In this analysis. If we start to see.

The very curvature of the wave. We 'll see that everything is the rhythm. To understand. To understand.

This is their cosmic heartbeat. To do For in the clock , we used to call this tick-tack.

So it does n't matter if you see it in this way , in this way , or in this way , this will be always a constant of rhythm. What we see from here is that rhythm is not just an aspect inside the wave. Basically , the wave is the rhythm.

So this is why this is a constant flowing of something that , in Greek , they call the flow , which is rain and the concept of flowing would be a thing.

So for the ancient ones , rhythm was not this. This is a constant flow. This is part of that flow , but it 's not separate.

So for example , in earth , we have summer autumn winter spring , and this is like tick-tack , tick-tack , but three months , three months , three months , three months , so what is this? It 's the different expressions of a wave. And here is when we understand the time does n't really exist as we believe , because time is basically the metric of a constant flow. The earth does n't stop one day and say it 's now a summer.

Now , here , it 's the summer. It 's the process to appear. It 's not one day. We are the ones that put dates to this flow.

So we say here , we caught it and we say 21st December for the south of the hemisphere. 21st December , 21st March , 21st June , 21st , stem row. And so on and of course is the opposite for the north of the hemisphere.

So we say dates , but the does n't begin , and that is the process.

So what happened in this wave after spring comes again summer and then autumn and then winter , and so it repeats constantly. Like a wave. You see here , imagine that this is the earth. Can you see the earth moving like the waves?

So when the earth is moving like this , creating the pendant which aims here , the the seasons , it creates a wave.

So as you see in earth , we all know animal kingdom , vegetable kingdom , mineral kingdom , human kingdom , we all know that after summer comes the autumn and so on winter spring , summer autumn , winter spring , summer autumn , it 's constant.

So through thousands of years of this repetition , we start to understand that we are all according to cycle.

So we adapt on earth because of this cycle. Because now we know what is going to happen.

So we evolve adapting to the next step. This is a systemic pattern.

So this system is the one that helps us to be who we are. Without the system , we would n't exist. This is a big picture. Like the earth.

But when we go inside the body , we find the NA. For those who live close to the equator , the process is much more like this.

So for those of the equator , this process will be called the dry and the humidity , dry and humidity. As you see , now all the things that exist in different levels is pick first of the law.

So we have this cycle of repetition. This are the two different waves that we live in , which is the NA , the NA , and the seasons in the planet. This is the one that we use constantly in our lives. We use it all the time.

Because for some , as an easy example , when it 's summer , but it starts to get cold. And you see this wind different from the ones of the summer , you already know what is going to come , what is coming ahead.

So you know the wind is coming.

So what you do is to prepare yourself like dressing different , to prepare your house , to prepare your environment , because the weather is changing.

So you have to adapt. As you see , this preparation is not something that you have to think about , is something that happens , that gets that it 's natural. It 's a reaction that you have.

So everything that is going to happen like it 's coming in the winter.

So you do n't have to think , oh , maybe it 's the solstice or the earth is spinning into this degree and you do n't think about all that. And try to understand the whole process. You just say , oh , cold. You do n't even think in winter.

It 's like it 's getting cold.

Okay?

So that 's how we get used to the rhythm.

So in the NA , it 's happening exactly the same. When new things are coming , what I do is to just look into the things that happened to me before , and I react according to my experiences.

So I get prepared for the things to come.

So I start to see all the same things once again , the same people , the same situations , and I kind of know that is happening. What a time. Even if we all know both the tropics that winter is something really bad because I can get sick , it 's a portable , I can not survive in the streets. And we all love that are the summer or the spring because we are more relaxed and so on.

But in winter , what happened also is that we have good memories , because we have Christmas , we have we have we have we can play with us now. I do n't know , the pendulum of who will live the winter in a different way. But we can have this sensation that we can enjoy. For example.

So now we are going to the point with this. The same happened in our NA. Imagine if all your history from your past your grandmother or grandfather , whatever. They were they had someone at home that used to hit them aggression.

But that aggressive people person is the one that brought the food like a dial , like a mom , whoever , people that brought the food at home.

So my NA understands aggression equals food.

So I can survive with aggression.

So in the future , I will find constantly a repeating process of as if people.

Okay , that I find and my body would say I am comfortable here because they give me food.

So in the same way as we in winter know that we can die , we can get a disease or whatever. But it 's so beautiful to know when. In our NA also we can enjoy aggression because that gives us food. It 's horrible.

So what I want to say about this is that the rhythm is not saying about things that happened around us that are similar to what happens to us. What I 'm saying with the rhythm is that it 's us ourselves that look for those situations in order to feel , to feel that we are secure in that repetition. As animals of how do you say costume re? Habitats.

So we are animals that we have a lot of habitats to.

So we get to the things that we know. The things that we know from the past there are our bits.

So this situations , we look for them because we want to feel at home. Even if there are bad things , sometimes our subconscious think that that 's the only thing that helped me to evolve to be who I am. And this is how we repeat once and again , constantly the same things.

So the law of rhythm is telling to me. It 's not the outer things that repeat on me. It 's me who is looking for that repetition.

So that 's why it 's only me. The one capable to transform that repetition. And the way I do it is by changing the wave of reckless. If I change my frequency , I see the things different.

I watch the reality from a different point of view. And how do I do it? By checking into what are the things that are repeating constantly in my life? When I acknowledge those things that are repeating constantly , I will try to look for the origin of all that and to see why I needed for it to repeat.

And once I understand this , I change the way in which I act according to that situation. And that 's how I will have a different answer of the environment. As an example , we would say , for example , that I have a conflict , a discussion , an argument , every year with the same person constantly all the time.

So what I know that is coming , what I know that that problem is coming.

So I have to see , okay , I repeat this concept. When was the first time that was originated? When was the first time that I felt this discussion , this argument?

## Q&A

So I go there , I try to understand from where it came from. And I asked myself , am I a different person from that person that is that that are the first time? If I am different , so I then can just change the reaction in the next argument.

So instead of arguing , I just , and when I smile , I do n't argue.

So the conflict is different. And suddenly , I get out of that vibration. This is a very simple example , but you have to see what are your own problems to see how to solve it. And I spoke more as always , my version of the day , yeah.

## Daily Practice Elements

Statement , I am stare to all levels. The code for today is the astral plane , originated from the word Astro , in Latin , meaning star. This means the plane of everything related to stellar. And this , to all astrological and astronomical forces that conditional us , the most ever that we contemplate among an entangled of vibrations who is not balanced , remain trapped in the astral 's web , repeating patterns over and over again.

Equally , heaven has the Christians , purgatory , are in this plane. For they are pre-concepts from earth , earthly vision. Let 's go to the element. We focus in the breathing , till the vessel follows , this world appeared strong as when an angels transitions to singling global Take a deep breath and start to create a round with the imagination , a huge library from which I am the only librarian.

I started to speak all the books through all the galleries , acknowledging all the patterns within my subconscious. In this library , it is my own Asahi Records. I set the intention now to find the book where I can read about my biggest pattern of repetition in my life. What is for a teaching constantly?

I am afraid by the resonance and when I find it , I am taking it to my hands. I go to the main hall of the library and I have seen front of me this huge stare of repetition. I take a look at the music and I see all these galleries around me. I call every level of my consciousness , they hold every level for inner dimensions of myself.

Every level of consciousness is here and through this place I can reach all of them. I arrive to the office of light. Without any doubt , I open the book in the light to bring clarity to this pattern of repetition. I take a deep breath.

I start to bring this book to my heart , integrate it with my vibration. I take a deep breath. I take a deep breath. I recognize that this pattern of repetition is a tool for my evolution in life.

So I set my intention to use it as such. I use I use I use my technique to all the galleries with all the book around through every level of consciousness. And I set myself. I use my technique to all levels.

I take care and start to bring your consciousness through your body , through your face and stretch and yarn and whenever you are ready , come back here and know. I use my technique to bring clarity to this level of consciousness.

## Q&A

So the task for today is to write down all these patterns that you see repeating in your life and to bring consciousness to that. Thank you for being there.
