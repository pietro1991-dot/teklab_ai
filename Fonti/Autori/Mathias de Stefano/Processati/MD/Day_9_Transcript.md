## Overview

On the ninth day of alignment, the focus shifts to the ankles, the chakra that governs our feet and our connection to the destiny we choose. The ankles represent the information of our path—where we go, the direction we take, and what we are heading toward. Today's practice invites us to understand that the system of reality is not linear but circular, like a closed circuit or pattern. Wherever we go, we always come back to the origin. The goal is not merely to accomplish our purposes but to understand the entire map, the whole system of our path.

The vibration "Mü" activates the portal to depth, allowing us to go into the deepest part of ourselves and connect with the core of the Earth. Today's code is exhalation, related to the process of integration—recognizing that everything has meaning and understanding the purpose of all that was created and lived. We learn to find coherence in all things and acknowledge that everything from the past shapes our being.

This is the last day of the first week, dedicated to the mind. The teachings today may challenge the intellect, inviting us to work with patterns, concepts, and the geometry of the self. We are asked to release the cultural belief that the underground or the core of the Earth is associated with hell or negativity. Instead, we connect with the core as the center that unites every path, the heart of the planet itself.

## Core Teaching

### The Ankles and the Path of Destiny

The feet and ankles hold the information of our destiny—where we go, the direction we take, and what we are heading toward. They represent the paths we choose and the destinations we pursue. The ankles chakra is the anchor point that connects us to the ground, to the Earth, and to the core of the planet.

Culturally, many traditions have taught us to fear the depths, associating the underground with hell or negativity. This belief has separated us from the Earth's core, from the very center that connects every path. Today, we must cleanse our minds of this idea and recognize that the core of the Earth is not a place of punishment but the heart of the planet—the center that unites all paths, all journeys, all beings.

### The Closed Circuit: Understanding the Map

We often think that when we start at an origin point and move toward a destination, we are going in one direction, moving farther and farther away. However, the system of reality is not linear—it is like a closed circuit, a pattern that constantly brings us back to the same origin. No matter where we go, we are always coming back to ourselves, to the source.

This means that the goal is not simply to accomplish our purposes or reach our destinations. The true goal is to understand the map, the system, the entire pattern of our path. All purposes can be accomplished when we recognize that all the paths we take come back to us. When we understand the whole map, we gain mastery over our journey.

### The Tetrahedron: The Geometry of the Path

The system we create in our path is shaped like a tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has one triangle as its base, and from each line of the base, another triangle rises, creating four triangles in total—three above and one below. This creates four trinities.

These four trinities contain twelve aspects—four times three equals twelve. We are twelve beings from eighteen different perspectives. The tetrahedron has six edges, and these edges represent the paths the self must take to create its experience. The self must walk twelve paths to the outside and twelve paths to the inside, coming out and coming back to the origin. This creates twenty-four aspects in total.

All of these aspects of the self must be integrated. For example, related to the incarnation system, if you go into one of the points or dots of the tetrahedron, you must experience every one of the spots and perspectives from your vision. Then you move to another point and integrate all the rest from your new perspective. This process takes approximately 144 lives on Earth to complete, though you can do it in more lives or fewer lives—it depends on how much work you are willing to do. There is no rush.

### Integration: Finding Coherence and Meaning

Integration means bringing coherence to all aspects of our experience. It means recognizing that everything that has happened, everything within us, has meaning and purpose. We are asked to understand that we are the sum of all we have experienced, and everything from the past shapes our being.

The code of the day teaches us that the universe recognizes that everything has some meaning and starts to give it, to understand the purpose of everything that was created and lived. We reach the epiphany of the highest sense of reality when we find coherence in all things.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit in a comfortable position, preferably in the tetrahedron posture, with your head up (not laying down).
2. Begin by massaging and caressing every part of your body.
3. Stretch your body and yawn to discharge all unnecessary energy.
4. Relax the joints—the arms, the legs—and let the body relax completely.
5. Focus on your breathing and become aware of each breath going with the air, the oxygen, through your lungs, your heart, through the blood toward the organs and muscles of your body.
6. Feel that with every breath, your body relaxes more.

**Important reminder:** Always breathe in by the nose and breathe out by the nose, as if you are smelling a perfume.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Pay attention to the part of your body that calls your attention—the part that feels more uncomfortable, that feels pain or pleasure. Bring all your attention to that part of your body.
2. Take a deep breath, acknowledging that part of your body.
3. Bring your attention to the hottest part of your body. Recognize that there, where you feel the hottest part, all your emotions are stacking.
4. Allow yourself, without thinking and without judgment, to feel the first emotion that comes to your mind, right from that hottest part of your body.
5. Breathe in very deep, recognizing the emotion.
6. Allow yourself to receive all the thoughts, and catch one of them without thinking, without expectations, and without judgment. Just take one, even if it's silly.
7. Take a deep breath and acknowledge the idea.
8. With your hands or your imagination, take these three—the part of your body, the emotion, and the thought/idea—as if they are three spheres of light.
9. Take them with your hands or imagination and bring the three of them toward your feet.
10. Without thinking much, just allow yourself to perceive the idea of these three and the connection you feel.
11. Recognize that these are the three tools that your higher self chose for you today to nourish the seeds of your ankles.
12. Take a deep breath and inhale the sense, the meaning of these three together, even if you don't get it—just smell it. Breathe in the meaning.
13. With your hands or imagination, take these spheres and place them in between the ankles.
14. Recognize that these are the three tools that will help you today to nourish the seed that connects you to the core of the planet, to the depth of the "I Am."
15. Become aware of the light of the "I Am" above your head.
16. With very deep breathing, start to descend the light through all your body. Take a deep breath and start to download it through the crown, the third eye, the throat, the heart, the plexus, the sacrum, the root, softly going down into your feet.
17. Observe the light of the "I Am" being absorbed by the seed, dissolving the three spheres, and starting to nourish the seed of your feet.
18. Start to activate the vibration of the seed by pronouncing the sound "Mü" (pronounced like "moo" with an umlaut).
19. Keep pronouncing the sound as you download the power of the "I Am": "I can, I can, I can, I can go through the depth toward the core of the planet. I can face every path of the Earth. I can go to the most deeper part of myself."
20. Recognize yourself ready to open the portals, the doors toward the depths.
21. Affirm repeatedly: "I Am the Portal to Depth. I Am the Portal to Depth. I Am the Portal to Depth."
22. See and feel the seed blossoming in the color magenta.
23. Visualize and feel that you can see the core, the heart of the Earth. Feel that you go through the crust, the magma, the iron sphere, toward the first atom, to the core.
24. Take a deep breath and recognize that every path of the Earth is at the same distance to the center. The only destiny, the only purpose, is the core.
25. From the core of the world, see that the network starts to weave all these flowers, these magenta flowers blossoming all around the world.
26. Observe how everything goes toward you, toward the deepest part of yourself.
27. Affirm: "I Am the Portal to the Depths of Myself. I Am the Portal to the Depths of Myself."
28. Take a deep breath and hold it. Just stay inside the experience.
29. Once more, hold and sustain the breath.
30. Exhale hard and discharge the energy from the feet toward the ground.
31. Recognize within you, in your body, that every door, every part of the "I Am," is opened within you.

### Closing

1. Caress your body gently, recognizing the integration you have received.
2. Stretch your body and yawn hard to cut the energetic connection and discharge static energy.
3. Rest and allow yourself to integrate the information and energy you have received.
4. If possible, walk barefoot on the ground to discharge any remaining static energy.
