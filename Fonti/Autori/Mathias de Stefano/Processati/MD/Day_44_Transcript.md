## Overview

Today we arrive at the heart chakra in the emotional week, exploring the profound difference between emotions and feelings. This distinction is crucial for understanding how we evolve emotionally and how we develop the tools we use to perceive and interact with reality. Many people use the words "emotion" and "feeling" interchangeably, but they represent fundamentally different aspects of our emotional experience, and understanding this difference unlocks a deeper comprehension of our evolutionary journey.

Before we begin the teaching, it's important to remind everyone that the information discussed each day relates to the concepts written in the daily blog. If you're following along day by day, reading the blog entries provides additional context and depth. The teaching shared here is the information known and felt from the higher self, channeled through conscious awareness.

The work we're doing is psychological and spiritual—a deep session of inner work being conducted with many people simultaneously. Whether you believe in these concepts or not, whether you're skeptical or devoted, you're welcome in this process. This is about analyzing ourselves, working with our inner being, trying to create more balance and coherence in our lives. You're free to judge, free to question, free to explore.

Today's focus on the heart brings us to one of the most misunderstood aspects of emotional work. We often hear spiritual teachings say "feel with your heart, not your head" or "emotions are magic we shouldn't analyze." While feelings and emotions are profound experiences, they are also natural phenomena we can understand scientifically and mechanistically without diminishing their beauty or importance. Today we explore how feelings function as evolutionary tools and perceptual filters that shape how we experience reality.

## Core Teaching

### The Critical Distinction: Emotion vs. Feeling

To understand the difference between emotions and feelings, we must first look at how we express this in language. In English, we use the verb "to be" in ways that actually contain two different meanings that are distinct in other languages like Spanish. We have "to be" in the sense of "being" something (identity, essence) and "to be" in the sense of "being in a state" (temporary condition).

For example, "I am enjoying" describes a temporary state—I am in the act of enjoying right now, in this specific moment. But "I am joyful" describes a more permanent quality—something about my essential nature or sustained state. This difference, subtle in English, reveals the distinction between emotion and feeling.

An emotion is experiencing something in a specific moment and space. It's a reaction—a consequence of a cause coming from outside. Emotion is the immediate response: "I am enjoying" this funny moment right now. It's temporary, tied to circumstances, a pulse of energy discharge.

A feeling is something that has become part of who you are through repetition and integration. It's the result of one emotion repeating constantly through your life until you made that emotion yours, until it became a tool you use to perceive reality. Feeling is: "I am joyful"—it's integrated into your being as a sustained quality.

Let's use another example to make this crystal clear. You might experience joy as an emotion when something makes you laugh in this moment. But happiness as a feeling is the integrated state of being that allows you to consistently perceive life through a joyful lens, regardless of whether something funny is happening right now.

### Feelings as Evolutionary Tools

Feelings are evolutionary tools—they are emotions that through repetition have been assimilated, processed, and transformed into instruments your soul uses to navigate reality. Just as our physical eyes developed through countless generations of evolution to perceive light, our feelings developed through our personal evolution to perceive emotional and vibrational reality.

This is crucial: feelings are not random. They are sophisticated perceptual instruments that were built through the proof and error of countless emotional experiences. Our eyes went through mistakes and adaptations throughout evolutionary history until they could see as we see now. Similarly, our feelings have been the proof and error of many emotions we experienced through our history, and now we use them to feel and perceive the world.

Feelings are filters. Just as our eyes filter the electromagnetic spectrum to show us only visible light frequencies, our feelings filter the total emotional reality to show us only certain frequencies, certain aspects. This filtering is not a flaw—it's a feature. It allows us to function, to make sense of the overwhelming complexity of vibrational reality.

However—and this is critical—we must acknowledge that this filtering means what we feel is limited. Just as what we see is limited to a small band of the electromagnetic spectrum, what we feel is limited to a specific range of emotional frequencies. Our feelings show us one perspective, one frame of a much larger reality.

### The Frames of Perception

Both beliefs (which belong to the mind) and feelings (which belong to the heart) are perceptual tools that help us navigate reality. Beliefs are ideas that were built to understand the world around us. Feelings are emotions that were built inside us to feel and perceive the world around us.

Here's where it gets interesting: the same frame our eyes can see of physical reality is the same frame our heart can perceive of emotional reality. If we acknowledge that what we see is just one aspect of the whole reality—limited by our visual apparatus—then what we feel is also just one aspect of the whole reality, limited by our emotional apparatus.

This is where many people enter into conflict. We start to perceive the world and make judgments: "This thing is bad because I don't feel it" or "I don't believe in that because I don't feel it" or conversely "This thing is good and I believe it because I feel it." But these judgments ignore the fact that we're limited by our perceptual frame, by the frequency range we're able to feel.

Let's use the example discussed in earlier teachings: A person vibrating at approximately 700 hertz will see the entire universe in the color red. Red is the frequency that matches 700 hertz vibration. This person literally sees everything red—that's their entire visual reality.

If you change this person's frequency to a higher vibration, they'll start seeing orange. Change it again, they see yellow. Then green, blue, indigo, violet. These different frequencies of perception create what we call parallel realities. Same universe, different perceptual frames based on different vibrational frequencies.

### Chakras, Colors, and Emotional Frequencies

We relate chakras with colors, and we also relate chakras with emotions. This isn't arbitrary symbolism—it's describing the actual vibrational mechanics of how reality works. Depending on the vibration and frequency you're operating at, you will see a certain color AND you will relate to a certain feeling or emotion.

The lower chakras vibrate at lower frequencies and relate to denser emotions and survival instincts. The higher chakras vibrate at higher frequencies and relate to more refined, expanded emotional states. This isn't a value judgment—lower isn't "bad" and higher isn't "good." They're different frequencies, different tools, different perspectives.

We divide reality into different frames, different aspects, different colors and emotions when we try to categorize and understand it. But really, it's all one continuous spectrum of vibration. What we're doing is perceiving and interpreting the universe from whatever vibration and frequency we ourselves are vibrating at in any given moment.

Within this universe of thousands of perspectives and vibrations, when you realize that even though you're only perceiving from your frequency, your color, your emotional filter, there is so much more beyond your perception—that's when you become conscious. That's awakening to the larger truth.

### What Consciousness Really Means

To be conscious is not to transcend your own frequency and go outside your own vibration. To be conscious is to realize that even though you have your own limited perception of reality, there are billions of other perceptions, and you can accept all of them as equally valid perspectives on the one underlying truth.

This understanding is what allows unconditional love to emerge. Why does this understanding of vibrational frequency help us comprehend unconditional love? Because love means eternity. Let's remember: the concept of love we call "ether" (space) and the time concept of love we call "eternal" come from the same root word. Ether and eternal—space and time united in love.

Everything that exists is created by ether, the fundamental substance of space. Everything that exists is also eternal—it doesn't disappear, it only transforms. All vibration connects us all. This all-connecting vibration, we call it eternity, the ethereal reality, the ethereal vibration.

What is unconditional love? To realize that everything that exists is eternal, is one thing, transforming itself constantly with thousands of perspectives. This is why we say love is infinite, love is the base of everything. When we talk about feeling love, it means to open yourself to realize that your perception, your feeling, is just a tiny part of the whole thing that exists.

### The Foundation of Unconditional Love

This creates an apparent paradox: before I can love the whole unconditionally, I must first love the tiny part that is mine. I cannot love the whole if I'm not able to love the tiny part I can perceive, the part that is mine, my limited perspective and frequency range.

This is critical: you cannot love the infinite if you cannot love the finite piece you're experiencing. You cannot embrace all frequencies if you reject the specific frequency you're currently vibrating at. Accepting and loving your limited perception is the gateway to accepting and loving the unlimited whole.

We must ask ourselves these questions: What are the feelings the world believes in me? What feelings do others perceive when they encounter me? And what are the feelings I use to perceive the world? These questions help us identify our current frequency, our current perceptual frame.

It's important to note: this teaching is not about trying to vibrate higher, to be more aware, to rise your vibration to be something different. That's often just spiritual escapism. Let's use a metaphor to understand why.

### The Building Metaphor: Knowing Your Floor

Picture life as a building with seven floors, representing different levels of consciousness or vibration. You start hearing gossip and rumors that in the seventh floor, there's someone called God, and it's amazing to be on the seventh floor. Sometimes rumors say everything there is amazing, wonderful, like heaven. Other times someone says a person came from the seventh floor transformed like a Christ. Everyone starts saying "Oh my god, I want to be on the seventh floor! The seventh floor would be amazing!"

But here's the question you must ask yourself first: On what floor am I right now? It's not the same to say "I'm on the sixth floor" versus "I'm in the first floor" or even worse, "I'm in the basement parking lot." This is the first question.

The next question: What am I doing on this floor? Why is this my job, my work on this floor? Then ask: Who is around me? What am I doing with them? Do I want to go to the seventh floor because of the rumors, or because I'm not feeling fine where I am?

If I want to leave my current floor, I must acknowledge: I have a job here, responsibilities here. I need to prepare someone to do my job so I can leave responsibly. I need to look at my desk and see what mess I have. I cannot leave my desk by just saying "bye, here's my problem" and walking away. I have to solve my problems, everything I hadn't solved, so the person who replaces me can keep going with the work.

Only after solving my own problems on my floor, after teaching the person who will replace my spot, can I go to the main hall and ask somebody: "How do I get to the seventh floor?" There's a guide who tells you: "There are two ways to reach the seventh—by the elevator or the stairs."

Of course, you say "I want to go to the seventh fast! The elevator!" But if you go in the elevator with just a belief that the seventh is great and an expectation that there you'll feel good, you ascend quickly from one dimension to another—really fast. You reach the seventh floor, the doors open, there's too much light, you can't see anything. Suddenly you see the shape of a person who gives you a stack of books and stuff, puts it in your arms and says "Oh you're the new one, really? I need you to bring this to the basement."

That's what happens to everyone who goes too fast—nobody knows you, you're the new one, you get sent straight to hell to do the grunt work. This is what happens when we try to jump levels without doing the work where we are.

### The True Path of Evolution

What do you have to do to go up responsibly? You have to go step by step, preparing yourself, making your contacts, meeting the people, making your way into the place while also letting go of your expectations. You have to be the best on your own floor first. When you master your current level, when you handle your own reality well, then others who are already on higher floors see that you're amazing at what you do. They come to you and say "Hey, we saw you did really amazing work. Why don't you come with us? You'll have a place here."

This is a very basic, even capitalistic way of seeing the universe, but humans understand it better through concrete metaphors. The joke of the universe is: when you reach the seventh floor after doing all this work properly, it's yourself sitting in the chair being the ruler, saying "Hi, welcome." You discover you were always already there—you just needed to do the work of actualizing that truth through every level.

All this explanation is to help you understand the importance of goals step by step. The first thing to do is acknowledge: On what floor am I? What is the space I occupy in this spot, on this floor? Once I know this, I must become the best at what I do on this floor.

Remember: feeling is to the heart what belief is to the mind. Both are perceptions, tools that help me accomplish my reality, my mission. They are filters through which I experience and navigate my current level.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit in a comfortable position and give thanks to your body for being the expression of spirit in matter. Begin to focus on your breathing, making it deep and conscious. With your imagination, bring the oxygen through your nose, guiding it to your lungs, heart, blood, organs, and muscles. Feel the life force moving through every cell.

Allow yourself to feel the heat within your body and how this heat, this energy, radiates through your skin, expanding all around you in every direction, creating waves in the great ocean of vibration and energy surrounding you.

### Guided Meditation Steps

1. **Floating in the Emotional Ocean**
   - Find yourself floating inside this vast ocean of vibration and energy
   - Allow yourself to feel the waves around you, how they move your body
   - Feel the gentle movement—side to side, softly, as the ocean of emotion holds you
   - Above you, perceive the light of the sun shining as the I Am, pure consciousness

2. **Rising to the Surface**
   - Taking deep breaths, start to rise toward the surface
   - Begin to emerge from the water, feeling yourself going outside the limits of the sea

   - Your arms come out of the water below your shoulders
   - Stop when the water level is at your heart—you feel it around your arms
   - The water remains below your heart, with your nipples just above the water line
   - Your wrists and hands stay below the water, feeling its coolness
   - The rest of your body remains beneath the sea

4. **Activating the Heart's Fire**
   - Take a deep breath and recognize: every wave around you is an emotion
   - All the waves together, surrounding you completely, are your feelings
   - These feelings are the history of your soul
   - Recognize that within your heart, your soul has registered every action, every history you have lived
   - Feelings are the books of your soul's history
   - They are the experience from which you perceive the world and your reality

5. **Bringing Light to Feeling**
   - Allow the light of the sun, the I Am, to dry your skin with its heat and light
   - Bring clarity and consciousness within you
   - Feel the light of the I Am in your crown, your third eye, your throat, on your heart
   - Feel it shining through all your skin above the water
   - Take a deep breath and bring the light of the I Am directly into your heart
   - Bring clarity and consciousness to each one of the feelings of your soul

6. **The Vibration of Soul**
   - Begin vibrating the sound, irradiating the light of consciousness from the heart
   - PHi... PHi... PHi...
   - Keep pronouncing the sound, bringing clarity to each one of your feelings
   - Continue: PHi... PHi... PHi...
   - Feel this vibration activating your soul, bringing light to your emotional history

7. **Recognition and Declaration**
   - Affirm: "I Am the Spark of the Soul"
   - Repeat: "I Am the Spark of the Soul... I Am the Spark of the Soul"
   - Take your hands to your heart
   - Recognize that all your feelings are the spirits of the soul
   - Feelings are the way you filter your perceptions of the world
   - You see the world through the eyes of what you have felt throughout all your existence

8. **Expanding Consciousness**
   - By enlightening your soul, you can amplify the way you feel the world
   - You expand your perceptual range, your frequency bandwidth
   - Affirm again: "I Am the Spark of the Soul... I Am the Spark of the Soul... I Am the Spark of the Soul"

### Closing

Breathe in deeply. Breathe out completely. Start to bring consciousness all through your body by caressing yourself, stretching, yawning. At your own pace, return fully to this present moment and space, opening your eyes when you feel complete.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Write down two distinct lists:

**List One:** What are the feelings the world believes about you? How do others perceive you emotionally? What emotional qualities do people seem to experience when they're around you?

**List Two:** What are the feelings you use to perceive the world? Through what emotional filters do you see reality? Are you looking at life through fear, through hope, through cynicism, through wonder? What is your dominant feeling-filter?

This exercise helps you identify your current frequency, your current floor in the building, your current perceptual frame. There's no judgment here—only awareness of where you actually are versus where you think you are or where you wish you were.

### Applying This Teaching

Stop trying to "vibrate higher" as an escape from your current reality. This is spiritual bypassing. Instead, ask yourself honestly: What floor am I on? What is my actual current frequency, not my aspirational one?

Once you identify your current level, commit to becoming the best possible expression of that level. If you're operating primarily from fear-based feelings (lower chakras), don't judge yourself for not being in bliss. Instead, master the lessons fear has to teach you. Become excellent at survival, at grounding, at physical reality.

If you're operating from heart-centered feelings, don't judge others for being in fear, and don't try to artificially maintain constant heart-opening when circumstances call for grounding. Each frequency has its purpose and its gifts.

Recognize that your feelings are filters, not absolute truth. When you feel something strongly, remember: "This is how I'm perceiving this situation through my current filter. Others might perceive this completely differently through their filters, and both perceptions can be valid frames of the same reality."

Practice unconditional love by first loving unconditionally your own limited perception. Stop judging yourself for not feeling everything, for not being open to everything, for having emotional boundaries and filters. These are your evolutionary tools, developed through countless experiences. Honor them while remaining aware they don't show you everything.

## Q&A

### Q: If feelings are just filters that limit my perception, should I try to get rid of them?

No! Feelings are essential evolutionary tools. Without filters, you'd be overwhelmed by the totality of vibrational reality—you couldn't function. The goal isn't to eliminate feelings but to become conscious that they are filters. With this awareness, you can recognize when your feelings are showing you one valid perspective among many, rather than assuming your emotional response is the only truth or the whole truth. The goal is conscious use of feelings as tools, not elimination of feelings.

### Q: How do I know what "floor" I'm actually on versus what floor I think I'm on?

Your actual floor is revealed by what you're actually dealing with in your daily life, not by your spiritual aspirations or peak experiences. If you're constantly dealing with survival issues (money, safety, health), you're working on lower floors regardless of how many mystical experiences you've had. If you're primarily working on relationship issues, you're on the heart floor. If you're exploring meaning and purpose, you're on higher floors. Your current challenges reveal your current level. Be honest about what's actually consuming your energy.

### Q: What's wrong with wanting to skip ahead to higher floors if I'm suffering on my current floor?

Skipping creates more suffering because you arrive unprepared, unknown, and get immediately sent back down to do grunt work. You haven't built the skills, relationships, or foundation needed for that level. It's like trying to do calculus when you haven't mastered arithmetic—you'll fail and feel worse. The fastest way up is actually to go step by step, mastering each level thoroughly. When you're excellent where you are, you get invited up naturally, and you arrive prepared and welcome rather than lost and out of place.

### Q: How can I expand my feeling-range if feelings are built through evolutionary time?

While the general capacity for feelings evolved over long periods, your personal range expands through experience and consciousness. Expose yourself to new experiences that generate new emotional responses. When you feel something unfamiliar, pay attention rather than suppressing it. This trains your feeling-capacity to recognize and integrate new frequencies. Most importantly, bring awareness to your current feelings rather than staying unconscious. Consciousness itself expands the range because you start noticing subtleties you previously missed.

### Q: If everyone is seeing parallel realities based on their frequency, how can we ever truly understand each other?

You can't see exactly what another person sees from their frequency, but you can recognize that their perspective is valid for their frequency. This recognition itself creates bridge understanding. When you stop insisting your frequency's perception is the only correct one, you create space for dialogue. You can say "From my frequency, it looks like this. From your frequency, how does it look?" This acknowledges multiple valid perspectives and allows collaborative exploration of the larger truth neither of you sees completely alone.

### Q: Does this mean some feelings are "lower" and some are "higher" and therefore some are better?

Lower and higher refer to frequency ranges, not value or worth. Lower frequency feelings (fear, anger, survival instincts) are essential for navigating physical reality and keeping you safe. Higher frequency feelings (love, joy, expansion) are essential for growth and connection. You need the full spectrum. The "goal" isn't to only feel high-frequency emotions—it's to have access to the full range and to use each frequency appropriately for what's needed. Someone in genuine danger needs fear, not forced bliss.

### Q: What's the difference between becoming the best on my floor and spiritual perfectionism?

Becoming the best on your floor means mastering the lessons that level offers, developing genuine competence and wisdom appropriate to that frequency. Spiritual perfectionism means beating yourself up for not matching an impossible ideal, usually borrowed from people on completely different floors. One is about genuine mastery; the other is about shame-based striving. Check your motivation: Are you developing because it feels right and true, or because you feel "not good enough"? True development feels like coming home; perfectionism feels like running from shame.

### Q: How do feelings as "soul history" relate to past lives or just this life?

Whether you interpret "soul history" as past lives or as the accumulated experiences of your current life and inherited family patterns doesn't matter—the mechanics work the same. Your feelings are built from repeated emotional experiences, whether those repetitions occurred across lifetimes or within this single lifetime and your ancestral lineage. What matters is recognizing that your feelings are accumulated wisdom from experience, not random reactions. They carry information from history—however you define that history.

---

**Note:** This teaching reveals that feelings are not obstacles to transcend but sophisticated evolutionary tools built through experience. The goal is not to eliminate feelings or force ourselves to "higher" frequencies but to become conscious of our current frequency, master it completely, and allow natural expansion from that solid foundation. Understanding that our feelings are filters—valid but limited perspectives on the whole—allows unconditional love to emerge: love for our own limited perception as the gateway to loving the unlimited whole.
