## Overview

Today we explore three related but different forces:

1. **Pulse** - from outside, unconscious
2. **Impulse** - from within, unconscious reaction
3. **Impetus** - from within, conscious action

This teaching is about **turning questions outward into questions inward**—the heart of emotional transformation.

## Etymology of Impetus

### Breaking Down the Word

**Impetus** comes from Latin:
- **In** = within
- **Petere** = to seek, to look for, to go toward

Related to:
- **Petition** (to ask for something)
- **Compete** (to seek together)
- **Perpetual** (to seek through)

Originally used in military context: **soldier** comes from the same root—one who seeks, who has impetus to move forward.

### The Evolution: Soldier → Warrior

- **Soldier**: Follows orders from outside (pulse)
- **Warrior**: Acts from inner strength and wisdom (impetus)

**Impetus means: the inner strength that seeks outward with consciousness.**

---

## Pulse vs. Impulse vs. Impetus

### Pulse: From Outside, Unconscious

Something happens **outside** of you, and your body/being responds **unconsciously**.

Examples:
- Your heart beats (you don't consciously control it)
- Someone yells, you flinch
- Music plays, your foot taps

**Pulse is the universe acting through you.**

### Impulse: From Within, Unconscious Reaction

Something triggers you, and you react **from within but unconsciously**.

Examples:
- Someone criticizes you, you immediately defend
- You see food, you grab it without thinking
- Someone cuts you off in traffic, you honk and yell

**Impulse is your ego's automatic defense mechanism.**

### Impetus: From Within, Conscious Action

You feel something within, **pause, become conscious**, and then choose your response.

Examples:
- Someone criticizes you → you feel the anger → you pause → you ask "Why does this trigger me?" → you respond consciously
- You want food → you notice the desire → you choose whether to eat
- Someone cuts you off → you feel the irritation → you breathe → you choose how to respond

**Impetus is consciousness using emotional energy wisely.**

## The Brain as Filter and Protector

### Why Your Brain Labels People

Your brain receives **billions of data points** every second.

It cannot process everything, so it **filters** and **labels** to protect you:

- "This person is dangerous"
- "That person is wonderful"
- "This situation is horrible"
- "That experience is beautiful"

These labels are **not reality**. They're your brain's attempt to **protect your ego**.

### The Ego's Job

**Ego is not the enemy.**

Ego is a **defense mechanism** designed to protect you from:
- Physical harm
- Emotional pain
- Social rejection
- Identity dissolution

The ego's job is **survival and protection**.

The problem is when the ego runs unconsciously (impulse) rather than being used consciously (impetus).

---

## Projection: The Outward Question

### How Projection Works

When something bothers you about another person, **the ego projects the problem outward**:

- "Why is this person so horrible?"
- "Why are they doing this to me?"
- "What's wrong with them?"

The ego believes: **If I can identify the external problem, I'm safe.**

### The Real Question

But the **real** question—the one that transforms—is:

**"Why do I feel this way with this person?"**

Not: "Why are they wrong?"

But: **"Why does this trigger me?"**

This is the **impetus**—the conscious turning of the question inward.

## Matias' Personal Teaching: Respect the Experiment

### The Context

Matias addresses a common pattern with his followers:

People project onto him:
- "You should do this"
- "You should be that"
- "Why aren't you more like this?"

### His Response

"I put my life as an experiment to show you things.

I know all my defects. I know what I have to work on.

**I don't get inside your life telling you how to live.**

**So respect mine too.**

I don't tell you how to live your life or what you have to do. You have your own path. The 'I Am' is not me, Matias. The 'I Am' is yourself.

If you follow me, you are not following the 'I Am.' You're following an external teacher—which is the opposite of what I'm teaching."

### Welcome to Aries Energy

This directness, this boundary-setting, this fierce clarity—**this is Aries energy**.

Not aggressive. Not mean. But **clear, honest, and self-protective**.

---

## The Personality as Mask

### Etymology of Person

**Person** comes from **persona** (Latin) = **mask**

In ancient theater, actors wore masks (personas) to play different roles.

### Your Personality

Your **personality** is the **mask** you wear to:
- Interact with the world
- Protect your true self
- Play your role in society

There's nothing wrong with having a personality.

**The problem is when you think the mask IS you.**

### Making the Ego Nude

The task is to **strip the mask**—not to destroy the ego, but to **see it clearly**.

Ask:
- "Which parts of my personality are authentic expression?"
- "Which parts are just protective masks?"
- "What am I protecting by wearing this mask?"

When you make the ego nude (remove the unnecessary masks), you can use it **consciously** rather than being used by it unconsciously.

---

## The Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Ask the Inward Question

When someone triggers you:

**Don't ask: "Why are they doing this to me?"**

**Ask: "Why do I feel this way about them?"**

This turns the energy from projection (outward) to introspection (inward).

### Step 2: Accept It's Your Perception

Recognize that your reaction is **your perception**, filtered through:
- Your past experiences
- Your wounds
- Your fears
- Your ego's protection mechanisms

The person might be acting badly, but **your specific emotional charge** is yours.

### Step 3: Recognize the Ego Protecting You

Instead of judging yourself for feeling triggered, recognize:

"My ego is trying to protect me. What is it protecting me from?"

Then you can decide: "Do I need this protection right now? Or can I respond differently?"

## This is Horribly Painful

### Matias' Warning

"The task here is that instead of just releasing things to the people outside that the ego thinks is the problem, what we have to do is come back and ask that to ourselves, to our ego.

**Throw that to our ego.**

**And this is horribly painful.**"

### Why It's Painful

Because it means:
- Taking responsibility for your reactions
- Seeing your own shadows
- Admitting you're not just a victim of others
- Facing what you've been avoiding

**But this pain is transformative.**

It's the pain of growth, not the pain of wounding.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Become aware of your breath and body.

### Heart Activation

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark.

Bring this light to your **heart chakra**.

### Recognizing Projections

Think of someone who triggers you—who makes you angry, frustrated, or upset.

Notice the impulse to blame them, to think about what's wrong with them.

### Turning the Question Inward

Now, with **impetus** (conscious inner strength), ask:

**"Why do I feel this way with this person?"**

**"What is my ego protecting me from?"**

**"What part of me does this person mirror?"**

### Sound Practice

Sound: **Ri**

**I am loving wisdom. I am loving wisdom. I am loving wisdom.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Removing the Mask

Visualize yourself wearing a **mask** (your personality, your defenses).

With love and gentleness, **remove the mask**.

See your ego clearly—not as enemy, but as protector.

Thank it for trying to keep you safe.

### Crown Through Root

Bring this **impetus** (conscious inner strength) through all chakras:

- **Crown**: Conscious ideas, not reactive thoughts
- **Third Eye**: Conscious perception, not filtered judgment
- **Throat**: Conscious truth, not defensive words
- **Heart**: Conscious feeling, not reactive emotion
- **Solar Plexus**: Conscious identity, not protective mask
- **Sacral**: Conscious creation, not compulsive reaction
- **Root**: Conscious reality, not unconscious patterns
- **Knees and Ankles**: Conscious path, not automatic habits

### Integration

Feel the difference between:
- **Pulse**: Life moving through you
- **Impulse**: Ego reacting unconsciously
- **Impetus**: Consciousness choosing wisely

All three have their place. Today, you're learning to **choose impetus**.

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Stretch. Yawn. Return here and now at your own time.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Every time someone triggers you today, **pause before reacting**.

In that pause, ask: **"Why do I feel this way?"**

Not as self-judgment. As **curiosity**.

### The Projection Journal

Write down:
- What the person did
- How you felt
- What you wanted to blame them for

Then ask: "What does this show me about myself? What am I protecting?"

### Conscious Impetus

Notice the difference in your body between:
- Impulse: tight, reactive, fast, defensive
- Impetus: grounded, clear, powerful, wise

Practice acting from impetus rather than impulse.

## Week Context

Aries Emotional Week - Wisdom Theme:

- Day 1 (Crown): Answer - spiritual wisdom
- Day 2 (Third Eye): Intention - conscious wisdom
- Day 3 (Throat): Set Free - coherent wisdom
- **Day 4 (Heart): Impetus - loving wisdom**
- Days 5-10 continuing...

Aries energy is fierce, direct, and initiating. Today's teaching shows how to use that force **consciously** (impetus) rather than **reactively** (impulse). This is loving wisdom—loving yourself enough to stop blaming others and ask the transformative questions.

## Q&A

### Q: Isn't it sometimes true that the other person IS wrong?

Yes. People can act badly. But your specific emotional charge, your particular trigger, your intensity of reaction—that's yours. You can acknowledge someone acted badly AND take responsibility for your reaction.

### Q: How is asking "Why do I feel this?" different from blaming myself?

It's curiosity, not judgment. You're not asking "What's wrong with me?" You're asking "What is this teaching me about my inner world?" One is self-attack, the other is self-discovery.

### Q: If ego is not the enemy, why do spiritual teachings tell us to "kill the ego"?

They mean: kill the unconscious identification with ego, the belief that the mask IS you. Don't kill the ego itself—it's a useful tool for navigating reality. Make it conscious, not dead.

### Q: What if I can't find the inward answer to why I'm triggered?

That's okay. The act of asking the question inward (instead of projecting outward) already begins the transformation. The answer might come later, or through layers.

### Q: How does this relate to setting boundaries? Shouldn't I tell people when they're wrong?

Yes. Impetus includes setting clear boundaries (as Matias demonstrated). The difference is: Are you setting boundaries from reactive defense (impulse) or from conscious self-respect (impetus)? Same action, different energy.

### Q: Why is it "horribly painful" to turn questions inward?

Because it requires facing your own shadows, wounds, and responsibility. It's easier to blame others. But the pain of growth is different from the pain of wounding—it leads somewhere.

### Q: What's the relationship between yesterday's "Set Free" and today's "Impetus"?

Set Free showed how to release energy safely. Impetus shows how to use that energy consciously. You set free the unconscious charge, then act with conscious impetus.
