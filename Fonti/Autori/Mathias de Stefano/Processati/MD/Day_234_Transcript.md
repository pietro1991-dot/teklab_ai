# Day 234 - Caresses: The First Language of the Soul

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Heart
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Caresses and the Sense of Touch as Soul Communication
- **Vibration:** `Ti`
- **Statement:** `I Am Manifested Love`
- **Code:** Virgo - what was harvested and won after being brought to the mother's house, guided by the father, must be ordered to separate the wheat from the chaff. The autonomic concept of the administration of the harvest—learning how many grains must be saved for eating, how many to save for the winter, and how many to sow the next spring—was the mother's task, represented by the earth, the generous soul that is at the service of keeping the balance between the parts. Virgo is like that, the energy of the order and the discernment between good and bad. Manifested love.

## Overview

Today we continue in the Physical Week of Pisces, working with the Heart Chakra. Our topic is caresses—the language of touch, the first sense we develop, and the way the soul and spirit communicate with reality.

Matias is exhausted today, very tired, but shares this essential teaching about how touch is the foundation of how we receive love and understand the world.

## What Are Caresses?

### The Daily Practice Instruction

This is related to what we do every day when we do an alignment. When we finish, Matias says: "Now caress the body and bring all this consciousness around the body through caresses."

The reason he says this—in case he didn't explain it for some of you before—is because of the integumentary system, which is the skin.

### The Integumentary System

"Integument" means to cover, from the word "tissue," which is related to something that is weaver. This integumentary system represents all the things that hold the body, the rest of the organs.

And in this system, it's where we have most of the information and interaction with the outside world towards the inside, sharing information from the outer reality to the central nervous system so the brain understands what is happening outside.

The skin is kind of a communicator between the outside and inside.

### Why "Caress Your Body"

That's why Matias says, "Caress your body." Through the nerves around the body, you can communicate and let the entire nervous system know everything that we are working with.

The integumentary system is the one that is constantly in connection with the outside. Everything that happens in the environment will be first connected to the integumentary system, the skin, before it gets connected to any part within the body.

The skin is basically the biggest organ that communicates what is happening outside into the inside.

## Caressing to Integrate Information

### Distributing Consciousness

This is why, when we are trying to expand information through the body, when we caress the body, when we bring this consciousness through the caresses into our body, what we have is a distribution throughout every one of the cells of this information we want to accept, to integrate ourselves.

We have spoken that the five senses are the ones that bring information from the outer world so it can be processed within. We already spoke about each one of the senses and how they work.

The thing is that the senses are the way in which we absorb information. Remember that we have spoken about these five senses that are: listening, hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch.

### Five Senses in Different Dimensions

These five senses are the only five senses. But in other dimensions, these five senses start to expand and expand according to the dimension where they are being experienced.

Taking information from the dimensions, you will see that the five senses will be experienced in different levels. That's why it seems like we have a sixth sense or seventh sense in a dimension, but actually they are the only five senses expressed in different dimensions.

## Development in the Womb

### Nine Months of Becoming Human

Now let's understand the senses from development. We as humans spend nine months in the womb of a mother trying to be human—developing our physical body, emotional, everything, to become a human.

But we are not always a human. We are basically a conjunction of cells with a soul, which means that we are a being until the fifth week of pregnancy.

### The Fifth Week: Individual Memory Begins

This means that we are a living being with emotion, because a soul has emotion—soul is energy. And so it's a living being with cellular memory. It has the memory in the cells.

But when we reach our fifth week in the womb of the mother, we start to create different synapses. We start to create synapses.

This means that before, we were a conjunction of cells with energy, with the soul inside. But we cannot be considered a human until we have our own memory as an individual.

In the fifth week is when we start to create synapses and we start to create our own memory as an individual inside the womb of a mother.

### Five Senses from the Beginning

In ourselves, we already have the information of the five senses. And remember, the five senses are the ways in which you can absorb, perceive the data from the outside, processed by what? By the neurons in the nervous system.

Since the fifth week of pregnancy, the person, the human, will start to use the five senses to store information for its own development as individual, as a human.

## Touch: The Primary Sense in the Womb

### Four Senses Not Much Used

Of course, when we are developing within, inside, there are four of those senses that are not much used until we are born. A few of them maybe you can use a little bit, but they are not properly used until we are really born.

For example, when you are in the womb of the mother:
- You cannot perceive much light, so you don't use the sight
- You don't listen much
- You can't really taste anything
- And of course, you can't breathe, so you can't smell because you are in the amniotic liquid

### Touch Is the Most Used

Basically, when a baby inside the womb, the one sense used the most is the touch—the sense of touch. It's the most used because the entire skin is the only one in constant touch of the environment all the time.

Basically, all information from the surroundings are received through the skin of the person.

## How Babies Hear Through Touch

### Not Through the Ear

You are in the womb of the mother. You don't listen really to the sounds, even if you perceive the vibration of sounds. It's not that we can hear words.

When you are inside the womb of the mother, what you can hear is kind of like when you are underwater diving in the water or pool—you can hear things like "wrong wrong," like this.

Why is this? Because you are not hearing through your ear.

### Through Bones and Skin

Basically, what happens is that the sound moves through the waves of water, and the water touches the skin. This vibration makes the bones vibrate, and the bones make the tiny little hammer bone rebound inside.

That's how you feel it. That's how you perceive vibration—not because of the air outside, not because of the ear.

This means that even the sense of hearing is perceived, received through the touch when you are in the womb.

## Touch Determines How We Relate

### The Baby's First Relationship

This is why usually a baby doesn't relate to the world with other senses. It relates with the sense of touch—by feeling the heart of the mother, by feeling the heat of the skin, by feeling the sounds from within the organs.

This is why a baby needs to touch, to caress, to feel the heartbeat, to feel the breathing, because the sense of touch is the only one that the baby has in the first stages to understand the world around.

### The First Month Determines Everything

It's important to know that when we speak about this, the first month of our life will determine the way in which we receive the information from the outer world through all our lives.

The way in which we feel touch, listen, perceive as a baby, as a child, will determine the way in which we are going to relate with others through life.

It's possible by understanding this that we can relate how today we are with other people according to how has been our process of gestation, how it has been the first month after we were born.

## The Soul and Spirit Need Touch

### Storage in Subconscious and Unconscious

Now we have this idea in our heads. We can picture that if through nine months we have been developing ourselves in the womb of the mother, absorbing the data through the skin, storing information in our brain through the nervous system, which is stored in this data for our subconscious and our unconscious—the ones that we call the spirit and soul.

This means that the spirit and soul needed from the sense of touch in order to design who we are.

### Constant Need for Touch

The spirit and soul are in constant need of the sense of touch to interact with reality.

Now we can understand that everything that happens through our skin, living our lives, will be the way in which the spirit and soul will receive the information from the environment.

---

## Spirit and Soul in Physical Terms

### Nervous System and Endocrine System

Remember that we have spoken some time ago that we cannot say that the spirit is within the soul, that the soul is within the body. We can understand that the spirit and soul are the same.

Now we can understand, for example, we can translate the spirit and soul in a physical way so we can understand how it works:
- We can understand it by saying that the nervous system is the spirit—the spirit is the nervous system, the brain with all the synapses, that's the spirit
- The soul must be the endocrine system with the hormones

### The Skin Informs Both

The way in which the nervous system and the endocrine system work and understand what to do is because of the pulses, the electrical pulses that the skin receives from the outside.

This means that the soul and the spirit cannot understand what is happening in reality without the interaction of the body.

---

## Skin as Extension of the Heart

### Heart: Where Soul and Spirit Find Balance

Now we can understand that the skin, the integumentary system, is an extension of the heart, an extension of the heart.

And the heart is the organ where the soul and the spirit find coherence, find balance.

### Healing Through Touch

This is why, in order to have a better relationship, a much more healthy relationship between the soul and the spirit, in order to be coherent, we have to heal our relationship with the touch, with the skin.

This is why, as Matias said today, caresses are the ways in which we can deliver love to our heart by touching the skin, to come back to the memory of the gestation and to rebirth from that.

## The Etymology of Caress

### From Latin "Carus"

The word "caress" comes from the Latin "carus," that means "the loved one," "the loved."

Which comes from the Indo-European language "kar," that means to desire, to wish for something.

Which at the same time comes from the Egyptian "ka," that means intention, spiritual energy.

### Awakening Spiritual Energy

To caress is not only to show love to others. To caress is also to awaken the intention of the spirit in others and in yourself.

Caress yourself. Touch. Feel the heat. Hug. Kiss. Whatever.

---

## The Practice Task

### For Those with Trauma

Remember that this touch, these caresses, are the tool to not only come back to the harmony of the being, but also to awaken the spiritual energy in the body.

And if there are people that have problems with this because of any trauma or something, just remember that there are a lot of people that study to help you with these things. Maybe you need some help—open yourself to some therapy to acknowledge how to heal that.

### Caress Your Entire Body

Matias is not in the mood to guide the full alignment today because he is so unbalanced. It would be a lack of respect to guide you when he is so unbalanced.

So he gives you the task: go to the blog (www.gnosoi.art, remember it's in Spanish: "Yo Soy"). You go there and below you have the music constantly playing 24 hours all the time.

Listen to that when you go to bed to sleep, and caress your body entirely from your feet until your head.

Caress your body.

## Integration

### Caress Practice

Tonight, when you go to bed, caress your entire body from feet to head. Slowly, deliberately, with love.

You are not just touching your skin—you are communicating with your soul and spirit. You are returning to the memory of the womb, where touch was your first and only language.

### Healing Touch Trauma

If you have trauma around touch, recognize that this is your opportunity to heal. Seek therapy if needed. Your soul and spirit need touch to understand reality. Healing this is essential.

### Caress Others

Caress someone you love today—a partner, a child, a friend (with consent). Remember: you are not just showing affection. You are awakening their spiritual energy.

## Q&A

### Q: Why is touch the most important sense?

Because it's the first sense we use in the womb, and it's the one that stores information in our subconscious and unconscious (soul and spirit). The way we experienced touch in the womb and the first month of life determines how we relate to the world forever.

### Q: How does hearing happen through touch in the womb?

Sound creates vibrations in the amniotic fluid. The fluid vibrates against the skin. The skin vibrates the bones. The bones vibrate the tiny hammer bone in the ear. So "hearing" in the womb is actually touch perceiving vibration.

### Q: What if I don't like being touched?

This is often because of trauma or how touch was experienced in early development. Seek therapy to heal this, because your soul and spirit need touch to communicate with reality. Healing your relationship with touch heals your relationship with yourself.

### Q: How does caressing awaken spiritual energy?

Caress comes from "ka" (Egyptian for spiritual energy). When you touch with intention and love, you activate the connection between skin (body), nervous system (spirit), and endocrine system (soul). This awakens coherence.

### Q: Why is the skin an extension of the heart?

Because the heart is where soul and spirit find balance. The skin receives information and delivers it to the nervous system (spirit) and endocrine system (soul). This communication creates coherence in the heart.

### Q: If we develop five senses in the womb, why do we only use touch?

We have the information of all five senses, but four of them aren't functional in the womb environment. No light for sight, no air for smell, no air for sound (except through water/touch), no food for taste. Only touch works fully.

### Q: How do I heal my relationship with touch?

Start by caressing yourself—gently, lovingly, deliberately. Return to the memory of safety, of the womb, of being held. If trauma arises, seek professional help. This is sacred work.
