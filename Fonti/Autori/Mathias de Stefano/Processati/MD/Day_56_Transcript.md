## Introduction

Hi , hi everyone. How are you? Oh good. Can you hear me?

So another day we meet each other from Visa. I know I 'm dressed exactly the same as yesterday , but I do to know that I got a shower.

Okay , so I 'm clean.

So today we are here to work with the sacra chara in the physical aspect , which is the physical week. And in the last days of beer go constellation.

So we are trying to finish this analyzing , analyzing month.

So of course that we are going to be analyzing ourselves through the whole year , but I guess not so much and so deep as we have done with beer go.

So let 's go to the information that I wrote today in the blog related to the sacra chara in the physical aspect , which is related to the concept of process , the process. For sure you have said to yourself or you have said about others that you are in a process that or that person is through a process. We usually talk about process in this spiritual world , but do we really know what a process means?

So related with what we had spoken with the pancreas yesterday , we are going to try to describe what a process means to understand first of all this concept , we should go to the origin of the world.

So process comes from the Latin word pro , which is to go ahead and cave re that means to walk.

So to proceed the process means to walk ahead to move forward to develop.

So the meaning of the word process would be to be moving forward through a path. That 's the meaning of process.

So always we may say , I am in a process , yes , or I am in a process of crisis or in a process of awakening , what we are trying to say is that we are moving forward and trying to evolve from what we first were.

So now you have the concept of process , this is the concept of wanting to go ahead to move forward. And then we have the word that is the verb of a forward which is to proceed to proceed and go ahead. But also we have the other word , that means to process something , to make something to go through a process , a material. And that 's the one that we are going to talk about.

So for example , when we start to talk about to process something , we usually talk about this in the concept of , I am trying to process this idea.

So what it means to process something , it is to hold , to catch a whole concept that I do n't understand that I do n't get.

So I start to divide it in different pieces so I can understand different parts.

So I could get the idea of the whole , because I can not process the whole thing , because I can not get it.

Something like usually happens with my videos , for example , that the whole thing maybe you can not get it , but then when you just try to put all the things by separate , you will pick all the concepts that , oh , I got this , I got this , I got that. And then you can understand everything.

So that means to process an idea.

So when we are trying to understand this from the point of view of the ideas , it 's not how we really do it in reality. And as humans , thinking is not the first thing that happened. What happens first is the biological aspect , the body.

So through the process of the body is how we create ideas.

So we have to go to the first system that makes the process of everything that comes within.

So we could understand how it works. And that system in our body that makes the most biggest process of the physical aspect is the digestive system.

So this is also what happens when we have a big concept or something that we can not understand. And suddenly you use the word , I am trying to digest this.

So the reason why we use the words to digest and to process things is because of the digestive system , because we want to separate the whole thing in order to understand the parts. And now we go to try to understand it. Yesterday we spoke , we talked about how the being is trying to get energy in order to move. And for that it needs energy from the outside.

What 's called love or food.

Okay. That 's why we spoke yesterday.

So when you bring that energy , that love or that food inside of you , in order for it to become energy for your action and life has to go through a long process.

Okay.

So that process is what we call to digest.

So the first thing that I do in the process is , for example , taking an apple , I see the apple , but then the first thing is to buy the apple and to start to treat to the apple until it starts to go in pieces.

So it 's easy for the digestive system to process that information. Because the first process that we do is with the teeth. This means that the teeth. The teeth are the first extensions of our old body that is trying to process information.

So the teeth , each one of them represent an aspect of our life in which we try to process information.

So we can go to each teeth to each tooth , sorry , to look for that information to see what they represent each other.

So the problem that I have in each tooth would be something that can show me where is my problem of processing information. This is why the teeth are the first filter from where I can understand from where I am presenting information.

So of course that you will have to go to someone that knows the classification of the teeth.

Okay. To understand which is the problem.

So the next step would be the software and the software would be the one that brings the information from the mouth , the food towards the stomach. And during that path , what we used to say is , for example , I can not swallow this situation. I can not , I aided as it came. I do n't know if you use this word in English , but it 's like I could n't see this before.

So I , so I just eat it.

Some expression or I swallow this line.

Okay. For example , all these things that connect what the process of communication of what we bring to our body. Then we have the stomach and the stomach will be the bag where all the food is being composed by the acids that were created in the Gallybladder.

Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Gallybladder.

So , Gallybladder. Gallybladder.

So from there , all the acids are created to make the food in pieces.

So tiny little pieces that it could be processed and absorbed by the intestine. The heavy part of the food will be processed also by the liver and the liquids will be also processed by the kidneys.

So the once this paste is created and it 's all fluffy and it 's composed , it goes straight to the nine meters of the end of the thin intestine.

So in the nine meters , there is a tiny hair like hair that absorbs all the nutrients , all the minerals , vitamins , and everything that was before the food.

So now it 's just tiny parts that can be absorbed and from there they are filtered to go into the blood torrent.

So from the blood it goes to all the body. Then of course from the blood the pancreas push the insulin , create the insulin to look for this carpsum. For this sugars in the blood and up to the tissues and from there from the molecule starts to divide in the atoms.

So the energy created from the division could be used by the cells to create energy , vitality. The rest what the body says , I do n't need this , this is useful , just is compact , all is well compact in the thick intestine and it goes out through the atoms. All of this process is about six to eight hours.

So every day we are between six to eight hours to make a process to take all this food , this energy compact energy after. And we dissolve it into parts , okay.

So we could think of what is useful for me and not.

So to all of that we used to this process. By hearing this we should understand now that we take a lot of time to one only thing and make it into pieces to see what we need and what we do n't need. What we do n't need , what we process and we say our body says I do n't need this , is not bad , this is not , it 's just that I do n't need it. But then somebody else will use it because they need it.

Like for example , the plants , they will need the shit to create compose for the fruits and the flowers.

So we should never say that when you take something , you have to believe it 100 %. And also you should n't say that when you have something and you do n't believe it is 100 % off. Because from everything there is something that we need and from everything there is something that we do n't need. And if we do n't need it is precisely because somebody else need it.

So this is why also we have problems creating a society because usually society where I ideology and by ideology I just say I just believe that everyone will need the same thing that I need. But it 's not like that. What I believe is what I need but maybe it 's not what the others need.

So what this means that even in the microcosmos and the macrocosmos , the whole thing is a process of digestion.

So we would say that now we find ourselves in the stomach trying to dissolve the parts to understand what they are.

So this means that what we have done to now is to to give what our ancestors in the team had already worked for us.

So they did a part in hearing something. That as a legacy we now have through the path of history in the soft.

So basically what we are just doing now is trying to go through the Jordan , how do you say it in English? With a foot inside the theme in this time. What we are just doing right now is to try to understand the meaning , the sense of everything , the forms that are surrounding us. That 's what we are doing now to understand.

This is what we are trying to do to dissolve the things to understand the things. That 's why we are heading to the Jordan and ending the process of the stomach.

So what it means to go into the intestine now , it means to find the true essence that you have within , that you are within.

So we could say that we are now entering in the intestine which is the beginning of our , of our existential process.

So this means that I came from the apple that the universe ate.

So I am a tiny piece of apple and I know that I am an apple , I am an apple , but I do n't know what I have to give from this what I am.

So inside the process of the intestine , I will recognize that inside this tiny little piece of apple , I also have fruit coasts , sugars that will be the essence that will help to the universe. Basically as a human , I am doing the same process. I recognize myself as a human and then I discovered the potential that I have within.

So when I activate my potentials , I become a part of the system of the universe and I give the best of what I can give for myself.

So I understand this that if I do the opposite thing , which would be no , I am an apple , I am an apple and I do n't , I am not anything else , I am just an apple , human , human , I am an apple.

So I close myself because I do n't want to share what I am.

So basically what I will become , you know what you will become. Yes , shit , boom , compose.

So basically this is what we see around in our planet , that thing that we may call human shit.

Okay , the things that we call human shit are all these humans or people that they are not bad people. They just believe that they are something that they are not.

So they just attach themselves to the idea of what they are , but they do n't allow themselves to discover what they really are within. We would say that there is no bad people or shift people , as we may say. What really exists is people that they are afraid and they do n't want to share the essence of what they really are. We have to picture this , that we have to take out the idea of thinking that there are bad people there and good people here , that there are useless people there , useful people here.

And that we need to rid those people because they are bad. No , what we have to do is to understand that those people maybe are not useful for our system , but they will be useful for another system. Because in the universe everything is recycling. If you find yourself surrounded with people that are open to show who they are , to set themselves to deliver themselves to the world , to do many things.

And they share the essence of who they are. They do n't have filters. They are free. They are in the path of looking themselves.

So this means that the interstate has absorbed your essence.

So you are going to the blood torrent of the cosmos. And the blood is heading where? Is heading to the heart? The heart is moving all the blood around.

So you are now useful for the whole world because the blood is going everywhere through the heart which is the service. Let 's see this idea. What happened in the other side? When you just are surrounded of shift people in your life.

And people that complains , people that gossip , people that is talking only about bad things. You only see shit around in the world. You can only see the bad things , everything. And you feel that the world is pushing towards you and making a lot of pressure and you feel in the prison full of shit.

Where are you?

Sorry , but I should tell you that you are in the thick interstate.

So you have gone straight through the nine meters. You are going to the compose. I think it 's an easy way to understand each part of the process we find ourselves. But basically what we have done is to deny to watch within , to forget , to take outside the essence because we were so concerned on looking into the shit that is in the world that suddenly we became also that shit.

## Energy Work

It 's not bad to be shit. It 's just a long process. It 's not bad comes here because you go to the plants and you tourism the roots and someday you will become a flower.

So you will flower. You will open your crown chara. You will. And then you will become an apple.

A fruit. And somebody will eat the apple. And the process starts again. The digestive system.

We as humans call it the process of the being. It 's so easy and so beautiful to say the process of the spiritual awakening that we sometimes forget about the intestines. And we forget that we are in a constant cycle. Observer this.

That when the food goes to the intestines and it goes to the blood from the blood , it goes to the tissues. The tissues. It goes to the cells from the cells. It goes to the NA.

And in the NA , I became the universe. I became a code in the universe. And that 's the process of enlightenment. If I am able to awaken my essence , I become part of the divine.

If I am not open , if I do n't awake my essence , so the divine will go to the bathroom. And when it goes to the bathroom , the cycle starts again.

So you have to become shit , go to the plant , become a flower , become a fruit , be eaten again , go to the digestive system. Be sheet again , go to the plant.

## Q&A

So the reason of all this is to absorb , to awake the essence of ourselves and not to become shit once and again. And the process keeps going because the question would be , and the divine , what does the divine after that?

So that would be for another time.

So I hope this explanation would be understandable for the process of enlightenment.

So the task for today would be to try to analyze , to understand , to write down , in which process I am living , observe the surrounding and try to understand , in which part of the process of the digestive system , you find yourself right now. And how do you process the information in your life? The task also leads to understand , what do you eat?

So take note of what do you eat? What of those things you know , they made you bad? What made you good? Fine.

If you have any problem in your digestive system , how do you live with that? How do you feel?

Okay.

So analyze , how are you eating? And how is the process of how you eat? By understanding the way how we eat , we also picture how we process life. I spoke too much.

Let 's go to the issue of today.

So because of some questions that I 've seen here , there are hundreds of people that work with biodecordification.

So they could help you to understand specifically what is the issue that you have in your body? To understand it better. And also nutritionist and algebraic , most of it.

So you could understand how to eat that according to your own self. To a nutritionist and a diode person that does biodecordification would help you much more in a tiny time than years of therapy.

## Daily Code

So try it. The vibration of today is too. The statement for today is , I am a grid of creators. The code of today is the soul pattern P.

It says. And it 's this and it is this fuel that gives us the force , the power , the will to act to move forward. The P sound is the pattern of action originated by the energy of what was consumed for the universe is just a being consuming its own energy and generating new one by doing it. In creativity , to keep on the cycle of production creators , we are does.

We begin by warning , stretching the body , messaging , causing. I left the weight of my body fall down as I focus in my breathing. I feel the oxygen coming in through my nose towards my lungs , heart , blood , organs and muscles. I feel the energy coming in through my nose.

Take a deep breath and go within your body with your mind. With your imagination , find a cell that you sound the most. And bring it in front of you until you see it big and big , bigger than your body. Take a deep breath and go inside the cell until you feel the dear floating in the seat of last time , touching with your hands the nucleus and grabbing with your hands the chromosomes until you just enroll it.

Feeling the chains of NA curling between your fingers recognize that they are the coats that you be where you are. I recognize that I am a mother cell within my mother 's body. I am now an egg. I watch above me and perceive the light of the egg coming towards me as a spiral in the shape of an espermatosoid.

## Energy Work

I feel the espermatosoid touching the limits of the cell , changing its polarity , making it shine as a sun. Take a deep breath and perceive how this espermatosoid with the energy of the I am starts to go where you are putting in a spiral , going through the crown , the throat , heart , plexus , and from there it is bread , its genetic material towards the scrum , the root , named and fit. I feel now how my cell starts to be divided into by meiosis. From my point of view , the I am , I perceive how these cells divide again in 4 , in 8 , 6 , and so on constantly until the expand creates my body.

I perceive how my organs begin to take form , my heart , brain , lungs , intestines , all of them with the muscles and bones. I start to perceive and feel my feet , my legs , arms and hands , my head. I am in the womb of other , recognizing that I am a creator being created. I recognize myself inside the process of existence , close to begin the process of life.

I become aware that a sign begins my life , everything that I inherit , everything that I eat in the outside will be the energy that I will transform into my tools to create more reality. In this way , I start to pronounce the sound , pushing my way out towards the life , recognizing that in my own sound , I start to create my own reality. I am in the womb of other , recognizing that in my own sound , I start to perceive my feet , my legs , arms and hands. I keep pronouncing the sound , I push up , open my palm , I side-feel the outer light , shine in my palm.

I start to go out , take the head outside , my neck , feeling the light , my shoulders , chest and back , arms , belly , waist , until the limits of my hip. And my hands , they feel like it from the outside , all around from my head , till my lower waist. And I become aware from that moment on , I am the creator of my own life. I am the greed of creators.

Everything that touches me , creates me. Everything that I touch is created for I am the creator itself. And I take a deep breath with all this consciousness. And I take my hands to my heart.

Everything that I eat becomes myself , create my body. For I am the product of many creators , and with that I can create my own. For I am the creator , I am the creator of creators. I begin to bring all this consciousness , this awareness through my body , by crossing , stretching and warning , until I open my eyes , coming back here.

So today we have each and the I am.

## Q&A

So remember that the task for today is to think about in which part of the process I am living in , the digestive system , what I am living right now. And I do I eat every day , how do I eat it , and how does this affect to my body.

## Energy Work

So I always drink a lot of water , rest , and see you tomorrow at the same time for the root chara. Bye.
