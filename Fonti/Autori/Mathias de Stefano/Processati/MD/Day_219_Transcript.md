## Overview

Today we arrive at the **ninth dimension**: the **hologram**, the projection of everything we have learned. All dimensions until now are contained within the ninth dimension, as if all of them are **projections** of the ninth dimension.

We have been learning about dimensions as if they are separate levels—first, second, third, and so on—but in truth, they are all **holograms of each other**. Each dimension is a projection, a reflection, a manifestation of the ninth dimension.

This teaching is connected to the **ankles chakra**, which represents our ability to **stand grounded** while maintaining connection to the higher dimensions. The ankles are what give us flexibility and balance—we can move, we can dance, we can walk across the earth while remaining connected to the sky.

We are in the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where we feel the dissolution of boundaries. The ninth dimension is the ultimate expression of this: there is no separation between dimensions, between beings, between creator and created. **All is one hologram**.

Matias offers the metaphor of **making a movie**: you are the producer, the writer, the director, the actor, the camera operator, the film, the projector, the screen, and the viewer—**all at the same time**. This is how the ninth dimension works.

## All Dimensions Are Holograms

### The Nature of Hologram

A hologram is a **projection**. When you see a hologram, you see something that appears three-dimensional but is actually **light projected through a pattern**.

The ninth dimension is the **hologram that contains all other dimensions**. Everything we have learned—the first dimension, second dimension, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth—all are **projections** of the ninth dimension.

### No Beginning, No End

This means there is **no linear creation**. It is not that the first dimension came first, then the second, then the third. They all exist **simultaneously** as projections of the ninth dimension.

The ninth dimension is like the **film projector**. All the other dimensions are like **images projected on the screen**.

### Everything Creates Everything

In the ninth dimension, there is a paradox: **the created is the creator**. The movie creates the filmmaker, and the filmmaker creates the movie. The hologram creates the light source, and the light source creates the hologram.

This is difficult for the linear mind to understand because we are conditioned to think in cause and effect, beginning and end. But in the ninth dimension, **everything creates everything**.

## The Movie Production Metaphor

### You Are the Entire Production

Imagine you want to make a movie. Matias offers this beautiful metaphor to understand the ninth dimension:

You are the **producer** (the one who finances the movie).  
You are the **writer** (the one who writes the story).  
You are the **director** (the one who decides how to tell the story).  
You are the **actor** (the one who performs the story).  
You are the **camera operator** (the one who captures the story).  
You are the **film** (the material that records the story).  
You are the **projector** (the device that plays the story).  
You are the **screen** (the surface that displays the story).  
You are the **viewer** (the one who watches the story).

**All of these at the same time.**

### The Seven Hermetic Laws Create the Story

The story of the movie is created through the **seven hermetic laws**:

1. **Mentality** (the principle of mind): All is thought. The movie begins as an idea in the mind.
2. **Correspondence** (as above, so below): The story reflects universal patterns.
3. **Vibration** (everything is in motion): The movie is music, rhythm, vibration.
4. **Rhythm** (everything has a heartbeat): The timeline, the pacing, the flow.
5. **Cause and Effect** (every action has a reaction): The conflict, the plot, the drama.
6. **Polarity** (everything has opposites): The protagonist and antagonist, light and shadow.
7. **Generation** (everything has masculine and feminine): The action begins, creation happens.

These seven laws are the **framework** through which the ninth dimension creates the movie of reality.

## Dimensions as Stages of Filmmaking

### Mapping Dimensions to the Movie

Now Matias maps each dimension to the process of making a movie:

- **First Dimension:** The beginning and the end of the plot. Alpha and Omega. The point where the movie starts and the point where it finishes.

- **Second Dimension:** The **storyboard**, the synopsis. Connecting the beginning to the end with a line. Deciding the major scenes.

- **Third Dimension:** The **characters and scenery**. Designing who the characters are, where they exist, what they look like.

- **Fourth Dimension:** The **narrative timeline**. How the story moves through time—flashbacks, flash-forwards, time jumps.

- **Fifth Dimension:** The **script**. The exact dialogue, the precise sequences, the why of everything that happens.

- **Sixth Dimension:** The **filming process**, transformation, expansion. Making changes, improving, trying new angles during production.

- **Seventh Dimension:** **Light, camera, action!** The moment of pure potential becoming real. The photons registering on the film.

- **Eighth Dimension:** The **film itself**—the cellulose, the material that **records the light**, the registry of every moment captured.

- **Ninth Dimension:** The **projection**. The light shining through the film back onto the screen, creating the **hologram** of the movie that the viewer watches.

### All Stages Exist Simultaneously

In linear time, you would make a movie step by step: first write, then film, then edit, then project. But in the ninth dimension, **all stages exist simultaneously**.

The projected movie (ninth dimension) contains the film (eighth), which contains the light (seventh), which contains the filming (sixth), which contains the script (fifth), which contains the timeline (fourth), which contains the characters (third), which contains the storyboard (second), which contains the plot (first).

They are **all holograms of each other**.

## God as Idea, Not Creator

### The Main Idea

Here is a profound teaching: **God is not the creator of the idea. God IS the idea.**

When you make a movie, where does the idea come from? Not from you as the producer, writer, or director. The idea **inspires** you. You receive **divine inspiration**.

"Inspiration" means **to breathe in** (in-spirare in Latin). You breathe in the spirit, the idea.

### Re-spiration: The Breath of Spirit

We **breathe**—we in-spire and ex-spire. We take in breath and release breath. This is **re-spiration**: returning to the spirit plane, breathing in the divine idea again and again.

When you create, you are not generating the idea from nothing. You are **receiving inspiration** from the main idea, from God, which is the idea itself.

### Everyone Creates Their Own Movie

Each person receives inspiration from the **main idea** (God) and creates their own movie based on that inspiration.

You have your movie. Your friend has their movie. Matias has his movie. We are all creating our own movies, but all are **inspired by the same source**.

The ninth dimension is where all these movies exist together as **one hologram**.

---

## The Paradox: Created Is Creator

### No Linear Creation Sequence

In the third dimension, we think: "First, God created the universe. Then, beings appeared. Then, I was born."

But in the ninth dimension, **the created is the creator**.

The movie creates the filmmaker. The viewer creates the screen. The hologram creates the light source.

### All Create Each Other

You create God by asking, "Who am I?" God creates you by answering, "I Am."

The first dimension creates the ninth dimension by defining beginning and end. The ninth dimension creates the first dimension by projecting the hologram.

**There is no first and no last.** All create each other simultaneously.

This is the paradox of the ninth dimension: **everything creates everything**.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Become aware of your breath. Notice the **in-spiration** (breathing in) and the **ex-spiration** (breathing out).

With each breath, you are connecting to the **spirit plane**, receiving divine inspiration.

### Recognizing Yourself as the Entire Production

Imagine you are making the movie of your life.

You are the **producer**: you finance this movie with your energy, your attention, your life force.

You are the **writer**: you write the story through your choices, your thoughts, your beliefs.

You are the **director**: you decide how to tell the story, which scenes to emphasize, which to cut.

You are the **actor**: you perform the story through your actions, your words, your emotions.

You are the **camera operator**: you capture the story through your perception, your awareness.

You are the **film**: you record the story in your body, your memory, your cells.

You are the **projector**: you play the story through your imagination, your dreams, your consciousness.

You are the **screen**: you display the story as your reality, your world, your experience.

You are the **viewer**: you watch the story unfold, witnessing yourself living.

**You are all of these simultaneously.**

### The Vibration Lü

Now, from your ankles, sound the vibration **Lü**.

Feel the connection to the earth beneath you, grounding you. Feel the connection to the sky above you, inspiring you.

**I Am love that nourishes. I Am love that nourishes. I Am love that nourishes.**

The love that nourishes all dimensions, all aspects of the movie, all roles you play.

### Breathing Divine Inspiration

Take a deep breath in—**in-spiration**. Receive the divine idea.

Breathe out—**ex-spiration**. Release what no longer serves.

**Re-spiration**: returning to the spirit, breathing in the idea again.

### Closing

See yourself as the **weaver** of ideas, actions, sounds, lights, and forms. You are the connection between all dimensions, all beings, all aspects of the hologram.

Take a deep breath. Each one in your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, practice seeing your life as a **movie you are creating**. Notice when you are the writer (choosing what to think), when you are the director (deciding how to respond), when you are the actor (performing your role), and when you are the viewer (witnessing your experience).

**Ask yourself:** If I am creating this movie, what changes do I want to make? What scenes do I want to emphasize? What story am I telling?

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel like a victim of circumstances, remember: **you are the entire production**. You are not just the actor in someone else's movie. You are the writer, director, producer, and viewer of your own movie.

When you feel separated from others, remember: we are all creating our own movies, but all are **inspired by the same divine idea**. We are all projections of the same hologram.

When you feel separate from God, remember: God is not "out there" creating you. **God is the idea that inspires you**. You breathe in (in-spiration) the divine idea with every breath.

### Breathing Practice

Throughout the day, become conscious of your breathing:
- **In-spiration**: breathing in the divine idea, receiving inspiration
- **Ex-spiration**: breathing out, releasing, letting go
- **Re-spiration**: returning to the spirit, breathing in again

This connects you to the ninth dimension—the source of all inspiration, all creation, all holographic projection.

## Week Context

We are in the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, moving from mental understanding to emotional knowing. The ninth dimension is felt as the **dissolution of all boundaries**—between creator and created, between self and other, between dimensions.

Pisces teaches us to **surrender to the flow**, to recognize that we are not separate from the divine but are expressions of it. The ninth dimension embodies this: we are not watching a movie separate from us—**we are the movie, and the movie is us**.

The ankles chakra (today's focus) allows us to remain **grounded** while experiencing this profound truth. We can walk on the earth while knowing we are the entire holographic projection of creation.

## Q&A

### Q: If I'm the entire movie production, can I change the plot of my life?

Yes. As the writer, you can rewrite the story. As the director, you can change how you tell it. As the actor, you can perform differently. As the viewer, you can interpret it differently. **You have the power to change your movie at any moment.** The question is: are you conscious that you are all these roles, or do you think you are only the actor following someone else's script?

### Q: How is God an idea and not a being?

God is the **source of all ideas**, the **ultimate inspiration**. When you have an inspired thought, where does it come from? Not from your brain alone—you receive it from the field of infinite possibility, from the divine idea. God is not a being sitting outside creation directing it—God IS the creative idea that moves through all beings, inspiring all creation.

### Q: What does divine inspiration actually feel like?

It feels like a sudden knowing, a creative spark, a moment of clarity, an "aha!" experience. It is the moment when you **breathe in** an idea that feels like it came from beyond you. Artists, musicians, inventors, and creators know this feeling—the inspiration that arrives as if from nowhere. That is **in-spiration**: breathing in the divine.

### Q: If the created is the creator, what came first—God or the universe?

**Neither.** This question assumes linear time and linear causation, which only exist in the third and fourth dimensions. In the ninth dimension, God and the universe create each other simultaneously. There is no "first"—there is only the eternal hologram where all creates all.

### Q: How do I practically apply the understanding that I'm the entire movie production?

Start by recognizing which role you are playing in each moment. Are you the victim (actor believing the script)? The observer (viewer watching passively)? The judge (director criticizing the performance)? Once you recognize your role, you can **choose a different one**. If you don't like what's happening, step into the writer role and change the story. If you're stuck in your head, step into the actor role and take action. You have all roles available always.

### Q: Does this mean reality is an illusion, just a hologram?

The hologram is **real**—it is a projection of light creating form. Reality is not "fake" just because it is a hologram. The movie you watch is real; you really experience it. The ninth dimension teaching is not that reality is false but that reality is **interconnected, multidimensional, and co-created** by all aspects of yourself simultaneously. The illusion is thinking you are separate from the creation.

### Q: How does breathing connect me to the ninth dimension?

Breathing is the **physical act** that mirrors the **spiritual process** of receiving and releasing inspiration. When you in-spire (breathe in), you receive the divine idea from the ninth dimension. When you ex-spire (breathe out), you release your creation back into the hologram. Re-spiration (breathing again and again) is the continuous connection to the spirit plane, the source of all inspiration. Conscious breathing makes you aware of this connection.
