## Introduction

Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to everyone.

So I changed place today because I am with all this huge group of people they are here. I will show it later.

So we are all together here.

So just for you to know , we are starting today. Our signing in Shedikpath of three days in this in Gia , in the pyramids. And we will be in the pyramids inside the pyramids at 5 a. M.

This next three days.

So whoever wants to just think about us being inside the pyramids , we will be grateful. Just a reminder , it wo n't be a connection through YouTube. It will be a connection through dreaming or thinking because we are going to be inside the pyramids. Of course.

So tomorrow in the morning , we will be in Miseryenus , then the day after in Khan , the last day , we will be in Kill.

So once we set this , let 's go to the topic for today , which is Karma , related to the ankles.

So we relate this topic with the ankles because the ankles are the ones that hold information , the data regarding our path.

So everything that we have done in every one of our lives. And one of the first things that we have to do according to this topic is to eliminate the myths that we have about Karma because in our Western societies , we kind of took the Karma as a synonym of sin.

So we sometimes believe that Karma is like this thing that could happen to us if we do bad things. The first of all , Karma is a word that came from the end of European languages. That was used and built by the Sanskrit language in the center and south of Asia. Karma comes from the word , car , that means action and cause.

And ma , which comes from man , that means the finger or the idea.

So Karma would be the concept of the action taking over the finger.

So this means this concept means that what we do , what we usually have to do is to understand that we are the thinkers , the mind , the consciousness is the first thing.

So the thinker , the person that thinks is the one that projects into the outside and action , something outside.

So you think and then you feel it and from your feeling you act , you take action into something.

So as we explained some times , the universe , from within , expressed in the outside and the outside looks that we did.

So within.

So it is like an echo , concept.

So this means that once we start to go into the process of life , sometimes what we thought felt and then took action to , this action will come back affecting my feelings and then the feelings affecting my thoughts.

So this process is the one that we use to describe as the process of learning because in life what we do is that we have an idea and then we project this idea in the outside as an action.

So then according to the results of that action is when we start to see , to perceive that the results maybe are different from what I thought.

So this gives me a new perspective of my thought of my way of thinking and tourism my tourism my own ideas.

So this process of thinking something to project it into action and then learn from the results of that action is what we call the process of learning to assimilate information.

So what we usually do in this process , we do it in a conscious way , we sometimes do it in a conscious way. In a conscious way , this process would be that I think about something and I projected into action so I can learn like an experiment of what is happening , okay , the results.

So I being aware I can understand the process. But what we usually do really is that we take action in an unconscious way and this means that we have no idea why we took action and we have no idea what to expect about the results.

So sure we all relate to this because what we normally do in our lives is to take action without knowing why we just act by reaction and we have never idea about the consequences of our actions.

So what we usually do as projecting this is that if we would have been conscious aware of the action that we did.

So we were expecting to learn something from the consequences of what we did. But because we do it without consciousness at all , the programming of the consequence is to teach me , we 'll work anyway.

So by being unconscious , I just do an action and the consequence will come back anyway to me to teach me something even if I have no idea that the system was like this.

So this means that it does n't matter if you were unconscious or conscious , the consequence of my action will try to teach me something.

So remember that the universe basically creates everything to be able to acknowledge itself to learn from itself , to see different perspective from itself. That 's the main goal.

So the concept here is that if we leave our lives through consciousness , what we will leave is that the actions that we took with its consequences will come back to me , pushing me to learn something.

So this means that the consequence of this action will modify and determine my thinking and that 's how the action takes over the thinker.

So when we call karma is basically the return or the echo of something that I have projected.

So if I projected the sound being aware of the sound with consciousness , so I will expect for the echo to be heard. But if I have no idea if I express this unconscious , so the echo someday will come straight to my face and I have no idea. This is why we call karma in a negative way because when we leave unconscious , we do n't expect for this teaching to come to my life , so it hurts.

So this is why karma is not about thing , neither a good thing.

Okay , karma is basically a process of learning.

So then comes the Dharma and what is Dharma? Dharma comes from the Sanskrit Dharma , Dharma means to possess or the law that you possess.

So for now , the Dharma is the sabidurya at Kirill , then the process of learning it.

So Dharma will be the wisdom acquire after the process of learning.

So to be clear about this , the process of karma is not the bad thing and then Dharma is the resolution. No , karma is the whole process. Karma is when you have the conflict and when you solve the conflict. All that is the process of karma because it is the process of learning of acknowledging something by experience and integration.

So what is Dharma? Dharma is when you put it all together and you now can give it as wisdom , can share it as wisdom. That 's Dharma.

So an important thing to understand is that once we have this big picture , we have to understand that there is no one in any dimension like saying , this is your karma , so you have to do this and that and that. No. The karma is not conditioned by any other being in the universe. Karma is basically something that you project from by yourself.

Remember , if the universe is like a wave of vibration , like the waves of the notion , so the high or the low of the waves will depend on how hard you jump into the water.

So it does n't depend on if I did something wrong or something good. It will depend on how hard , how strong I move myself in the water.

So this means that the universe made us responsible ourselves for everything that happens to us.

## Q&A

So now the question would be , but why I am responsible of things that I had no idea , like from other lives or other people from my family tree , why should I be responsible of something that I do n't know? Well , remember , the universe is basically waves , so it 's everything connected.

So every life is just a wave and then you die. Life , death , life , death , constantly.

So every life is just the reflection , it 's just the movement being pushed by the force that you did before.

So it 's not separate from you. You are not unique here. You are a consequence of what you did.

So you are responsible of that , even if you forgot it , because how many things in your life have you done and you forgot and you 're responsible anyway.

So now about this system of the karma , like waves , if I become aware , if I am conscious , I will realize that I have to be responsible of everything that happens , so I start to seek about what happened before.

So in my life now I can try to correct that for the next waves.

So what happened when I am unconscious and aware of things?

So I just relied the responsibility to the system of the waves of the vibration. There 's some people talking about this kind of board of beings in charge of karma , like carbon console , something like that.

So this movement of positive and negative is what we call the carbon console.

So if you move unconscious in this wave , so this carbon console or whatever you want to call it. We are just trying for the people that are in one state of vibration to be in the same level of vibration , so they do n't get lost and they can find the same information that they were working with.

So they keep you in the same level.

So basically the carbon board from the point of view of the universe , they would be like this electric electrician. Electrician , electrician , trying to control the watts of light. Yeah.

So the soul was.

So the reason why I compare with the electrician with electrician is because souls are energy light.

So imagine that someone is vibrating in 110 watts and suddenly the energy comes in 220. Basically , the soul explodes.

So that 's why these electrician are trying to balance that constantly.

So this is why we have the feeling that there are beings there controlling the karma. Because this is not because they control all the karma. They are just in charge of the unconscious energy.

Okay?

So if you are conscious , this does an effect.

So somehow this is help. It 's not something that conditions you.

So when we usually say we have a karma with a person , this means that we are still in the process of learning something with that person.

So a karma in a relationship with people , they could be also bad because something that you have to learn is very heavy and you do n't want it and you suffer. And also can be a process of learning that you are doing a project together and you are learning together.

So it 's fun and you 're having a lot of good emotions about it.

So it 's a good karma.

So the karma process is not negative. The process of karma is of learning.

So we have two different ways in which we can leave this karma. And both of them can be either lived in the good way or the bad way , which are the conditional one and the unconditional one.

So the conditional one is that I have expectations and preconcept with this process of learning with the other person. And unconditional basically is simple. It means that I do n't have expectations and I do n't have preconceptions.

So I do n't know if you have experienced this but it 's very difficult to be unconditional when you have a karma. For example , an unconditional way in a good karma would be to have fun with the other person learning , not expecting for any results of what we are learning. And a conditional way of a good karma would be I am willing for have good results in this what we are doing and I hope that that person is always there to help me in whatever problem I have. I guess that we all know what it means to have a bad karma with condition.

And this is the normal things that we have with all the people that we have problems with. Why this person is doing constantly the same to me and blah blah blah this kind of thing. And the unconditional way of a bad karma is when you realize that what you are living with that person is just a reflection of something that you need to learn but you have no idea why it is yet.

So you let the person free from having the heavy of taking the burden of being that reflection.

So remember karma equals learning. Dharma is yet quite wisdom.

So that 's it.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is you. The statement for today is I am the dimension of the whole. The code for today is the truncated octahedral.

Nothing the vertices from the octahedral of the metro figure will have a new figure that has 14 faces. Eight hexagonal and six squares. With 36 edges and 24 vertices. The six square faces represent the entry and exit directions of the energies from up and down.

Right and left. Being the flow of the beam while it 's eight hexagonal faces are the cells of life. First , this figure or pattern is the base of the confirmation of the hard chara. Let 's go to the alignment.

## Energy Work

We can relax the body , my stretch net and we begin concentrating our breathing. I remember that I am on the ground. Being a seed absorbing the nutrients of the mat , extending the roots to the ground and the leaves above to the surface. Take a deep breath and I expand towards the forest , the feeling and its animals.

I feel my roots. I feel my roots. Causing the roots of the tree of life , a side row up through the branches and leaves searching for the light. With my hands , I can accompany this process of flowering , going up to the light.

So , I reached the surface of the tree , growing , being able to see the whole forest from the boat and the savanna with its animals. I go higher as I can see the entire rainforest in Tair-Savanna , the coast and the sea in the horizon. And I open the flower , reaching the light , the side , reaches the skies. I can perceive the yellow light of the sun , the blue light blue of the sky and the white light from the clouds.

And I open this flower entirely , as I reach the atmosphere and go into the space. And now I can perceive the that light that I was searching for is in the surface of the earth. And I can see Africa , the lo me. To the north , I see Europe , Middle East , Asia , a side row around the globe.

I can see the Americas , the Pacific Ocean , Oceania , Antarctica. In this world , I find everything that I learned. All the things that I have already learned and all the things that I have to learn still. And the things that I have learned that I am learning and that I will learn.

Leave here on earth. This is my great learning process. I am part of it. I am that I am the whole.

I can find all the paths that I have gone through and that I will. I take the earth softly with my hands and bring it in between my feet.

So , I have to be able to activate it with my vibration. Recognizing that I am the whole learning process of earth. I am the dimension of the whole. I am the dimension of the whole.

I am the dimension of the whole. I see everything I see. All lives within me in the shape of wisdom. I see.

I am taking my hands to my heart. Each one at a time starts bringing this consciousness through the body by crossing , stretching , and tagging , and yelling. Whenever you feel ready , come back here and now open your eyes. Thank you everybody for being there , for connecting every day.

Thank you for coming. I see you. Thank you. I always see you tomorrow at the same time.

Bye. Thank you.
