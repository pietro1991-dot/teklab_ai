## Overview

Today's teaching comes from inside the pyramids of Giza during a three-day journey. We explore the true meaning of karma - not as punishment or sin, but as the process of learning through action and consequence. We learn how the universe made us responsible for our own experience through the law of echo, and how consciousness transforms karma into dharma (wisdom).

## Context: Inside the Pyramids

The group is in Giza, Egypt, beginning a three-day journey inside the pyramids:
- **Day 1 (today)**: Pyramid of Menkaure
- **Day 2**: Pyramid of Khafre  
- **Day 3**: Great Pyramid of Khufu

At 5 a.m. for the next three days, they'll be inside the pyramids. Those who want to connect can do so through **dreaming or thinking** (not YouTube) - sending energy to those inside the pyramids.

## Karma and the Ankles

We relate this topic with the **ankles** because ankles are the ones that **hold information and data regarding our path** - everything we have done in every one of our lives.

## Eliminating the Myths About Karma

### Western Misconception

One of the first things we must do is **eliminate the myths** we have about karma.

In our Western societies, we kind of took karma as a **synonym of sin**. We sometimes believe karma is like this thing that could happen to us if we do bad things.

**This is NOT what karma is.**

### True Origin of Karma

**Karma** is a word that came from **Indo-European languages**, used and built by the **Sanskrit language** in central and southern Asia.

**Karma** comes from:
- **"Kar"** = action and cause
- **"Ma"** (from "man") = the thinker or the idea

**Karma = the action taking over the thinker.**

This concept means we must understand: **We are the thinkers.** The mind, the consciousness is the first thing.

The **thinker** (the person who thinks) is the one who projects into the outside an **action** - something outside.

## The Process of Karma

### Think → Feel → Act

You **think**, then you **feel** it, and from your feeling, you **act** - you take action on something.

As we've explained before: The universe from **within** expresses in the **outside**, and the outside looks back to the **within**. It's like an **echo** concept.

### The Learning Cycle

Once we start the process of life:
1. We have an **idea**
2. We **project** this idea into the outside as an **action**
3. According to the **results** of that action, we start to see that results maybe are **different from what we thought**
4. This gives us a **new perspective** of our thought, our way of thinking
5. This transforms our own ideas

**This process** - thinking something, projecting it into action, then learning from the results - is what we call the **process of learning**, of assimilating information.

## Conscious vs. Unconscious Karma

### Conscious Process

In a **conscious way**: I think about something and project it into action **so I can learn** - like an experiment of what's happening, the results. Being aware, I can understand the process.

### Unconscious Process

What we **usually** do: We take action in an **unconscious way**. This means we have **no idea why we took action** and we have **no idea what to expect** about the results.

We all relate to this - what we normally do in our lives is **take action without knowing why** we just act by **reaction**, and we have **no idea about the consequences** of our actions.

### The Universal Programming

If we had been **conscious and aware** of the action we did, we'd be expecting to **learn something** from the consequences of what we did.

But because we do it **without consciousness at all**, the programming of the consequence to teach us **will work anyway**.

**By being unconscious, I just do an action, and the consequence will come back anyway to me to teach me something - even if I have no idea the system was like this.**

**It doesn't matter if you were unconscious or conscious - the consequence of my action will try to teach me something.**

## The Universe's Purpose

Remember: The universe basically creates everything to be able to:
- **Acknowledge itself**
- **Learn from itself**
- **See different perspectives of itself**

**That's the main goal.**

## Karma: Action Takes Over the Thinker

If we live our lives through consciousness, the actions we took with their consequences will **come back to me**, pushing me to **learn something**.

This means the **consequence of this action will modify and determine my thinking** - and **that's how the action takes over the thinker**.

When we call something **karma**, it's basically the **return or echo** of something I have projected.

### Conscious vs. Unconscious Echo

If I projected the sound **being aware** of the sound with consciousness, I will **expect the echo to be heard**.

But if I have **no idea**, if I express unconsciously, **the echo someday will come straight to my face**, and I have no idea.

**This is why we call karma in a negative way** - because when we live unconsciously, we don't expect this teaching to come to our life, **so it hurts**.

**Karma is not a bad thing, neither a good thing. Karma is basically a process of learning.**

## Dharma: The Wisdom Acquired

Then comes **Dharma**. What is Dharma?

**Dharma** comes from Sanskrit **"Dharma"** = **to possess** or **the law that you possess**.

**Dharma is the wisdom acquired after the process of learning.**

### Clarification

To be clear: The process of karma is **not** "the bad thing and then Dharma is the resolution."

**NO.**

**Karma is the WHOLE process**:
- When you have the conflict
- **AND** when you solve the conflict

All that is karma because it's the **process of learning**, of acknowledging something by experience and integration.

**Dharma** is when you **put it all together** and you now can **give it as wisdom**, can **share it as wisdom**.

## No Cosmic Judge

An important thing to understand: There is **no one in any dimension** saying "This is your karma, so you have to do this and that and that."

**NO.**

**Karma is not conditioned by any other being in the universe.** Karma is basically something **you project from yourself**.

## The Wave Analogy

Remember: If the universe is like a **wave of vibration**, like waves of the ocean, the **high or low of the waves** will depend on **how hard you jump into the water**.

**It doesn't depend on if you did something wrong or something good.** It depends on **how hard, how strong you move yourself** in the water.

**The universe made us responsible ourselves for everything that happens to us.**

### Why Am I Responsible for Other Lives?

**Question**: "But why am I responsible for things I had no idea about - like from other lives or from my family tree? Why should I be responsible for something I don't know?"

**Answer**: Remember, the universe is basically **waves**. It's everything connected.

Every life is just a **wave**:
- Life → Death → Life → Death → constantly

Every life is just the **reflection**, the movement being **pushed by the force you did before**.

**It's not separate from you.** You are **not unique here**. You are a **consequence of what you did**.

**You are responsible for that - even if you forgot it.**

**How many things in your life have you done and you forgot, and you're responsible anyway?**

## Consciousness Changes Everything

### When I Become Aware

If I become **aware**, if I am **conscious**, I will realize I have to be **responsible for everything that happens**.

So I start to **seek about what happened before**. In my life now, I can try to **correct that** for the next waves.

### When I Am Unconscious

What happens when I'm **unconscious and unaware** of things?

I just **rely the responsibility to the system** of the waves, of the vibration.

### The Karmic Board

There's talk about this kind of "board of beings in charge of karma" - like a **karmic council**.

This movement of positive and negative is what we call the **karmic council**.

If you move **unconscious** in this wave, this karmic council (or whatever you want to call it) is just trying to keep people in one state of vibration in the **same level of vibration**, so they don't get lost and they can find the same information they were working with.

**They keep you in the same level.**

### The Electrician Analogy

The karmic board from the point of view of the universe would be like **electricians** trying to control the **watts of light**, the soul watts.

Why this analogy? Because **souls are energy, light**.

Imagine someone vibrating in **110 watts**, and suddenly the energy comes in **220 watts**. Basically, **the soul explodes**.

**That's why these "electricians" are trying to balance constantly.**

This is why we have the feeling there are beings controlling karma. **It's not because they control all karma** - they're just in charge of the **unconscious energy**.

**If you are conscious, this doesn't affect you.** So somehow, this is **help**, not something that conditions you.

## Karma in Relationships

### What Is "Having Karma" with Someone?

When we say we have **"karma with a person"**, this means we're still in the **process of learning something** with that person.

Karma in a relationship with people can be:
- **Bad** - something you have to learn is very heavy, you don't want it, you suffer
- **Good** - a process of learning you're doing together as a project, having fun, good emotions

**The karma process is not negative.** The process of karma is of **learning**.

## Two Ways to Live Karma

Both can be lived in a good way or bad way:

### 1. Conditional Karma

I have **expectations and preconceptions** with this process of learning with the other person.

**Example of conditional good karma**: "I'm willing to have good results in what we're doing, and I hope that person is always there to help me in whatever problem I have."

**Example of conditional bad karma**: The normal things we have with all people we have problems with. "Why is this person doing constantly the same to me?" Blah blah blah - this kind of thing.

### 2. Unconditional Karma

I **don't have expectations and I don't have preconceptions**.

**It's very difficult to be unconditional when you have karma.**

**Example of unconditional good karma**: To have fun with the other person learning, **not expecting any results** of what we're learning.

**Example of unconditional bad karma**: When you realize what you're living with that person is just a **reflection of something you need to learn**, but you have **no idea why it is yet**. So you **let the person free** from having the burden of being that reflection.

## The Simple Truth

**Karma = Learning**

**Dharma = Acquired Wisdom**

**That's it.**

## The Truncated Octahedron Geometry

Cutting the vertices from the octahedron creates this new figure:

- **14 faces** (8 hexagonal, 6 squares)
- **36 edges**
- **24 vertices**

The **six square faces** represent the **entry and exit directions** of energies:
- Up and down
- Right and left
- Front and back

Being the **flow of the being** while its **eight hexagonal faces** are the **cells of life**.

**This figure/pattern is the base of the conformation of the heart chakra.**

## Guided Meditation: The Whole Learning Process

The meditation journey connects us with Earth as our learning ground:

1. Relax body, stretch, concentrate on breathing
2. Remember you're on the ground as seed
3. Absorb nutrients of mud
4. Extend roots to ground, leaves above to surface
5. Expand toward forest, feeling animals
6. Feel roots crossing roots of Tree of Life
7. Row up through branches and leaves, searching for light
8. Accompany flowering process, going up to light
9. Reach surface of tree, growing
10. See whole forest from above, savanna with animals
11. Go higher: entire rainforest, savanna, coast, sea, horizon
12. Open flower, reaching light, reaching skies
13. Perceive yellow sun, blue sky, white clouds
14. Open flower entirely, reach atmosphere, go into space
15. Perceive light you searched for is in surface of Earth
16. See Africa below
17. See Europe, Middle East, Asia as you row around globe
18. See Americas, Pacific Ocean, Oceania, Antarctica
19. **In this world, find everything you learned**
20. **All things you have already learned**
21. **All things you have to learn still**
22. **Things you are learning now**
23. **Things you will learn**
24. **All live here on Earth**
25. **This is your great learning process**
26. **You are part of it**

**You ARE the whole.**

Find all paths you have gone through and that you will. **Take Earth softly with your hands** and bring it **between your feet**, activating it with your vibration.

**Recognize: I am the whole learning process of Earth.**

**Reflection:** Karma is not a cosmic punishment system or divine retribution for sins. It is simply the elegant law of echo - the return of our actions as consequences designed to teach us. Whether we act consciously or unconsciously, the universe ensures that consequences return to educate us, to give us new perspectives, to transform our thinking. We are not victims of karma; we are students in the university of experience. Each life is a wave pushed by the force of previous waves, each relationship a mirror reflecting what we need to learn. The universe made us completely responsible for our own experience - not to burden us, but to empower us as co-creators. When we become conscious, we can direct our learning intentionally. When we remain unconscious, the universe still teaches us, but the lessons may hurt because they surprise us. The goal is not to escape karma but to transform it into dharma - to alchemize experience into wisdom that we can then share with others. Earth is our great school, and we are both student and curriculum, both learner and lesson. Every moment, every person, every challenge is an opportunity to learn and evolve. This is not punishment - this is the universe loving us enough to ensure we never stop growing.
