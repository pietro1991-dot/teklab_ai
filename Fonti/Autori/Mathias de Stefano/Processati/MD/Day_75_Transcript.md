## Overview

We're on **Day 5 of the Emotional Week of Libra**, working with the **Solar Plexus chakra** and exploring **Egocentrism and Egoism**.

These two words carry enormous weight in modern spirituality and culture. We've been taught:
- "Let go of your ego"
- "Ego is the enemy"
- "Be egoless"
- "Transcend the ego"

Especially in spiritual communities, having an "ego" is seen as the ultimate failure. Being "egocentric" or "egoistic" is the worst accusation you can level at someone.

But today we'll discover something that may shake everything you've been taught:

**Ego is not bad. Ego is not evil. Ego simply means "I"—the individual person.**

And we'll learn the profound difference between:
- **Egocentrism**: Being in your center, on your axis
- **Egoism**: Transforming yourself while maintaining that center

The problem is not having an ego. **The problem is having an unbalanced ego—an axis that's not in the center, or transformation that's chaotic.**

**You cannot eliminate your ego without eliminating yourself.** But you can balance it.

This teaching will revolutionize how you understand selfhood, spirituality, and the purpose of the individual in the collective.

## Core Teaching

### What Does "Ego" Actually Mean?

Let's start at the foundation:

**EGO is Greek and Latin for "I"**

That's it. It's not complicated. **Ego = I, the individual, the person.**

**It's not bad or evil. It just means "I."**

When you say "I am hungry" or "I think this" or "I feel that"—that's ego. The sense of individual existence and experience.

### The Historical Context: Individual vs. Collective

To understand why ego became "bad" in our perception, we need to understand history.

**Modern civilization is highly individualistic.**

We're used to one person speaking to many people (like these videos, like social media, like hierarchy). The individual is highly valued.

**But for most of human history, this was the opposite.**

**Throughout history, surviving as a group was more important than the individual surviving.**

If someone put themselves first, put their individual needs above the group's needs, that was **dangerous for everyone's survival.**

So culturally and religiously, societies developed teachings that said:
- "No one is better than another"
- "We must help each other"
- "Share what you have"
- "Be together, not separate"

**Being individual, standing out, putting yourself first = giving your back to the group = risk = bad.**

This made sense for survival. **If you don't share food, some people starve. If you don't work together, everyone dies.**

### Culture and Religion: Making Ego Bad

This survival necessity became encoded in culture and religion:

- "Don't think you're special"
- "Pride is a sin"
- "Humble yourself"
- "Serve others, not yourself"
- "The individual is nothing; the collective is everything"

**This is not wrong for its context**—it helped humans survive when cooperation was life-or-death.

But it created a deep cultural programming: **Individual = selfish = bad.** **Collective = selfless = good.**

### The New Age Problem: Same Teaching, New Language

Fast forward to modern times and the New Age movement.

**The New Age movement inherited the exact same teaching**—just with new spiritual language:

- Instead of "Don't be prideful," it's "Let go of your ego"
- Instead of "Serve others," it's "Transcend the self"
- Instead of "Be humble," it's "Ego is illusion"

**It's the same old message: Being individual is bad, being "egoless" is enlightenment.**

But we're not in survival-mode tribal societies anymore. Context has changed. Yet the teaching remained the same.

### What is Egocentrism? (Being in Your Center)

Now let's look at what these words actually mean:

**EGOCENTRISM = EGO + CENTRISM**

- **EGO** = I, the individual
- **CENTRISM** = going back to the center, to the core, to the essence, to the axis

**Egocentrism means: going back to your center, to your core, to your essence, to your axis.**

This is not a bad thing! **This is essential for existence.**

### What is Egoism? (Transformation in Motion)

**EGOISM = EGO + ISM**

- **EGO** = I, the individual
- **ISM** = movement, action, a way of being (like capitalism, socialism, activism—these are all movements)

**Egoism means: the ego in movement, the individual in transformation, empowering the self, creating your own reality.**

Again—this is not inherently bad! **This is the natural process of growth and change.**

### The Earth Example: Perfect Metaphor

To understand these concepts clearly, Matías offers a brilliant metaphor:

**Think of the Earth:**

**The Earth has two movements:**

1. **Rotation on its own axis** (spinning around its center)
2. **Translation** (moving around the sun)

**EGOCENTRISM = Rotation** (spinning on your own axis)

The Earth is literally **ego-centric**—it has its axis in its center, and it spins around that center.

**Without this centered spinning, the Earth wouldn't exist as a stable form.**

**EGOISM = Translation** (movement that creates change)

The Earth's movement around the sun creates the seasons, creates transformation, creates change throughout the year.

**Without this transformational movement, there would be no seasons, no evolution, no change.**

### Both Are Necessary

**The Earth NEEDS both:**

- **Egocentrism (rotation/center)**: To maintain its identity, its stability, its core
- **Egoism (translation/movement)**: To create transformation, seasons, change

**If Earth had only egocentrism** (only rotation, no translation around sun):
- Stable center, yes
- But no seasons, no transformation, no evolution
- Static existence

**If Earth had only egoism** (only translation, no rotation):
- Constant movement, yes
- But no stable axis, chaotic, no solid identity
- Destabilized existence

**You need BOTH. Always both.**

### Egocentrism = Being in Your Center

**Egocentrism is NOT a problem when it means being in your center, on your axis.**

It's about:
- Knowing who you are
- Being grounded in your essence
- Having a stable core
- Maintaining your identity

**This is healthy and necessary.**

### Egoism = Transformation of Self While Centered

**Egoism is NOT a problem when it means transforming yourself while maintaining your center.**

It's about:
- Growth and evolution
- Creating change in your life
- Empowering yourself
- Moving through seasons of transformation

**This is healthy and necessary.**

### When Does It Become a Problem?

**The problem occurs when:**

1. **Your axis is not in your center** (you're off-balance, destabilized)
2. **Your transformation is chaotic** (movement without direction, change without purpose)

**When your ego-centrism is off-center:**
- You think you're the center of EVERYTHING (not just centered in yourself)
- You make everything about you
- You can't see others' perspectives
- Your axis has shifted from center to an extreme

**When your ego-ism is chaotic:**
- You change for the sake of change
- You transform without integration
- You move without direction
- Your growth is destabilizing rather than evolutionary

**The solution is NOT to eliminate ego.**

**The solution is to BALANCE ego:**
- Get your axis back in the center (healthy egocentrism)
- Make your transformation directional and purposeful (healthy egoism)

### You Cannot Eliminate Ego

Here's the revolutionary truth:

**If you eliminate your ego, you eliminate yourself.**

**To eliminate ego is to disappear, to not exist.**

Ego = I = individual consciousness = you existing as a distinct being.

**No ego = no you.**

Those who teach "transcend the ego" either mean "balance the ego" (but are using imprecise language) or they don't understand what they're teaching.

**You're not here to disappear. You're here to exist as an individual expression of universal consciousness.**

Your work is not to eliminate yourself but to **balance yourself**:
- Centered in your essence (healthy egocentrism)
- Transforming with purpose (healthy egoism)

### Nothing is Good or Bad—Only Balanced or Unbalanced

This is a core principle for all of life:

**Nothing is inherently good or bad.**

**Things are either balanced or unbalanced.**

- Egocentrism balanced = healthy center and axis
- Egocentrism unbalanced = thinking you're the center of everything

- Egoism balanced = purposeful transformation
- Egoism unbalanced = chaotic change without integration

- Doubt balanced = curiosity and learning (Day 71)
- Doubt unbalanced = paralyzing uncertainty

- Certainty balanced = integrated wisdom (Day 71)
- Certainty unbalanced = rigid dogma

**The question is never "Is this good or bad?"**

**The question is always "Is this balanced or unbalanced?"**

### Finding Your Axis

**When you're dealing with any conflict or problem in your life, ask:**

**"What is the axis of this conflict? What is the seed, the core, the center of this?"**

Not the symptoms. Not the surface drama. Not the reactions.

**The CORE. The CENTER. The AXIS.**

When you find the axis, you can recenter around it. When you're centered, transformation becomes natural and directional rather than chaotic.

### The Trinity Code: Creation Through Dance of Opposites

The **Trinity Code** teaches:

**"Two forces create a neutral product. This is the concept of all creation. Nothing is created by itself, but by the dance of opposite forces creating what was never there. This union is why everything can be created. The concept that gives hope to creation."**

**Egocentrism and Egoism are two forces:**
- One provides center and stability (egocentrism)
- One provides movement and transformation (egoism)

**Together they create: A balanced, evolving individual.**

**Neither alone is sufficient.**

Center without transformation = stagnation.  
Transformation without center = chaos.

**The dance between them creates healthy existence.**

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch your body. Yawn. Cross your limbs.

Relax your body, focusing on your breathing.

### Becoming Wind

Start to perceive the air coming inside your body.

Feel how it moves inside you, making you feel like you are empty.

Only air and wind is spinning within you. Feel the air around your body connecting with the air within your body.

Feel yourself soft and light like a feather.

### The Soul's Energy

Perceive the energy of your body moving like wind within your body in a spiral of colors.

Expressing outside through the skin like a twister around you.

### Illuminating the Solar Plexus

Put your hands facing the sky at the height of your heart.

Perceive the light of the I Am, of the sun, coming towards you, going through the crown and anchoring in your solar plexus with a beautiful golden yellow color.

Perceive the golden light filling your solar plexus—your center of personal power, identity, and will.

Feel this light flowing down into your hands, filling them with golden radiance.

### Integration: Finding Your Axis

**First, find your center—your axis:**

Imagine your spine as the axis of the Earth, running through your center from crown to root.

**This is your egocentrism—your axis, your core, your essence.**

Feel yourself stable, centered, grounded in who you are.

### Egocentrism in One Hand

**In one hand, hold EGOCENTRISM:**

Your center, your axis, your core essence. The rotation around your own center. Your stability and identity.

Like the Earth spinning on its axis—**ego-centric**, centered in self.

### Egoism in the Other Hand

**In your other hand, hold EGOISM:**

Your transformation, your growth, your evolution. The movement through seasons of change. Your empowerment and creation.

Like the Earth moving around the sun, creating seasons—**ego-ism**, self in transformational motion.

### Understanding Both

**Egocentrism without egoism** = no transformation, no growth, no seasons. Stable but static.

**Egoism without egocentrism** = no center, no axis, chaotic transformation. Change without integration.

**BOTH together** = centered transformation, grounded growth, stable evolution.

### Checking Your Balance

**Is your axis in your center?**
- Or has it shifted to an extreme?
- Do you see yourself as the center of everything?
- Or have you lost your center trying to be "selfless"?

**Is your transformation purposeful?**
- Or is it chaotic and destabilizing?
- Are you changing with direction and integration?
- Or changing for the sake of change without wisdom?

### Unification

Take both hands to your solar plexus—your power center—bringing egocentrism and egoism together.

Feel them unify: **Centered transformation. Grounded growth. Stable evolution.**

Unify them with the vibration of your being:

**SSfaner... SSfaner... SSfaner... SSfaner...**

**"I Am the Flux of Connections."**

I am connected to my center. I am connected to my transformation. I am connected to myself and to all that is, simultaneously.

### Closing

Take a deep breath and start to spread this consciousness, stretching, caressing, and yawning.

Come back here and now, opening your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Finding Your Axis in Conflicts

**When you encounter any conflict or problem today:**

Don't get lost in the symptoms, the drama, the surface reactions.

**Ask: "What is the AXIS of this conflict?"**

- What is the core issue beneath all the noise?
- What is the seed that grew into this situation?
- What is the center that everything else is orbiting around?

**Once you find the axis, ask:**
- Is my axis in my center regarding this issue?
- Or have I shifted to an extreme?
- How do I recenter around this axis?

This practice trains you to find the essential core of situations rather than getting lost in peripheral chaos.

### Checking Your Egocentrism: Are You Centered?

**Healthy egocentrism (balanced):**
- You know who you are
- You honor your needs and boundaries
- You maintain your identity while relating to others
- You're stable in your essence

**Unhealthy egocentrism (unbalanced):**
- You think you're the center of everything
- Everything has to revolve around you
- You can't see others' perspectives or needs
- Others exist only in relation to you

**If you're unbalanced: Recenter.**

Your axis should be in YOUR center (knowing yourself), not making yourself the center of EVERYTHING (narcissism).

### Checking Your Egoism: Is Your Transformation Purposeful?

**Healthy egoism (balanced):**
- You're growing and evolving with purpose
- You empower yourself to create positive change
- Your transformation is integrated and directional
- You create your reality consciously

**Unhealthy egoism (unbalanced):**
- You change chaotically without integration
- You transform without consideration of impact
- You empower yourself at others' expense
- Your growth destabilizes rather than evolves

**If you're unbalanced: Find direction.**

Your transformation should have purpose and integration, not just be random change or selfish advancement.

### Releasing "Spiritual Ego Shame"

**If you've been taught that having an ego is bad, that being "egoless" is the goal:**

**Release that shame.**

You are not bad for existing as an individual. You are not unspiritual for having needs, boundaries, identity, self-awareness.

**You are meant to exist.** You are meant to be centered in yourself. You are meant to transform and grow.

**The teaching "let go of ego" was misunderstood or mistranslated.**

What's meant is: **Balance your ego.** Get your axis in your center. Make your transformation purposeful.

**You cannot and should not eliminate yourself.**

### The Earth Practice: Both Movements

**Spend time today feeling both movements:**

**Egocentrism (rotation):**
- Sit still and feel your center
- Notice your axis—your spine, your core
- Feel yourself as a stable, centered being
- Honor "I am"

**Egoism (translation):**
- Move through your day with purpose
- Notice how you're transforming, growing, changing
- Feel yourself creating and evolving
- Honor "I become"

**Both are sacred. Both are necessary. Both are you.**

## Q&A

### Q: If ego isn't bad, why do so many spiritual teachings say to transcend it?

**Because "transcend the ego" is often a mistranslation or misunderstanding of "balance the ego."** In some spiritual traditions, "transcending ego" means seeing beyond the illusion that you're ONLY an individual separate from everything else—you're also connected to the universal. But this doesn't mean eliminating your individuality. It means holding both truths: you're an individual AND you're part of the whole. That's balance, not elimination.

### Q: What about people who are genuinely selfish and harmful? Isn't that ego?

**That's UNBALANCED ego.** Their axis is not in their center (they see themselves as center of everything), or their transformation is chaotic and harmful. The problem isn't that they have an ego—everyone has an ego. The problem is their ego is not balanced. Telling them to "eliminate ego" won't help. Teaching them to center their axis and direct their transformation purposefully might.

### Q: How do I know if I'm being healthily centered or narcissistically self-absorbed?

**Healthy center (egocentrism balanced): You know yourself AND you can see others clearly.** You honor your needs AND you honor others' needs. You have boundaries AND you have compassion. You exist as yourself AND you recognize others exist as themselves. **Narcissism (egocentrism unbalanced): You see yourself as the center of everything.** Others exist only in relation to you, only to meet your needs. You can't genuinely see their perspective or honor their existence separate from their usefulness to you.

### Q: Can I be TOO selfless? Is that also unbalanced?

**Yes! If you've lost your center completely trying to be "selfless," that's unbalanced egocentrism.** You've moved your axis away from your center entirely. You don't exist except in service to others. You have no boundaries, no identity, no sense of self. This isn't spiritual—it's self-abandonment. You need to reclaim your healthy egocentrism: knowing who you are, honoring your center, maintaining your identity while also caring for others.

### Q: What about the teaching "die before you die" or "ego death" in spirituality?

**Those teachings are about the death of the ILLUSION of separation, not the death of individuality.** You "die" to the belief that you're separate from everything else. You "die" to the limited identity of ONLY being this body, this personality, this life story. But you don't cease to exist as an individual expression of consciousness. Think of it as: die to the small ego (I am ONLY this limited thing), awaken to the large self (I am this AND the universal), but you don't disappear—you expand.

### Q: How does this relate to the Trinity Code (two forces creating neutral product)?

**Egocentrism (stable center) + Egoism (transformational movement) = Balanced Individual (the neutral product, the creation).** Neither force alone creates a healthy being. Too much center without transformation = stagnation. Too much transformation without center = chaos. The DANCE between them creates something new: a being that is both stable and evolving, both grounded and growing. That's the trinity—creation through the union of seeming opposites.

### Q: Is this teaching saying individualism is always good?

**No. It's saying the individual is not inherently bad, but must be BALANCED.** Extreme individualism (everyone for themselves, no community) is unbalanced. Extreme collectivism (individual doesn't matter, only group matters) is also unbalanced. Healthy balance: individuals exist, matter, have value AND are connected to and responsible to the collective. Both/and, not either/or.

### Q: What if I don't know what my "center" or "axis" is?

**That's the work: discovering your center.** Ask yourself: What do I value most deeply? What feels like home in my soul? What remains true about me even when everything else changes? What is non-negotiable about who I am? Your center is your essence—the unchanging core beneath all the changing circumstances. Meditation, reflection, therapy, life experience—these all help you discover and know your center.

## Closing Reflection

Today we've explored **Egocentrism and Egoism**—two concepts that have been deeply misunderstood and unfairly maligned in spiritual teaching.

**Ego is not the enemy. Ego is simply "I"—the individual existence.**

We've been taught for centuries (first by survival-based cultures, then by religion, now by New Age spirituality) that the individual is bad, that ego must be eliminated, that being "selfless" is enlightenment.

**This teaching was useful for group survival in certain contexts. But it's created generations of people ashamed of existing as individuals, trying to eliminate themselves in the name of spirituality.**

**You are not here to disappear. You are here to exist—beautifully, powerfully, purposefully.**

**Egocentrism** (being centered in your essence, grounded in your axis) is not selfishness—it's necessary stability.

**Egoism** (transforming yourself, empowering yourself, creating your reality) is not narcissism—it's necessary growth.

**The Earth teaches us perfectly:**
- Rotation on its axis = egocentrism (stable center)
- Translation around the sun = egoism (transformational movement)
- Both together = seasons, life, evolution

**You need both:**
- Center without transformation = stagnation
- Transformation without center = chaos
- Center WITH transformation = balanced, evolving life

**The problem is not having an ego. The problem is having an UNBALANCED ego:**
- Axis not in your center (thinking you're center of everything)
- Transformation that's chaotic (change without purpose or integration)

**Your work is not elimination. Your work is BALANCE:**
- Recenter your axis in your true essence
- Direct your transformation with purpose and integration

**Nothing is good or bad—only balanced or unbalanced.**

This applies to everything we're learning in the Emotional Week. Doubt and certainty, remember and oblivion, cognition and ignorance, extroversion and introversion, egocentrism and egoism—none of these are good or bad. They're balanced or unbalanced.

**Your journey is about finding balance, not picking sides.**

**"I Am the Flux of Connections."**

You are connected to your center (egocentrism) and to your transformation (egoism). You are connected to yourself as an individual and to the universal whole. You are both/and, not either/or.

**Honor your ego. Balance your ego. Be yourself—centered and transforming.**

See you tomorrow for Day 76, as we continue the Emotional Week.

Rest well. Drink water. Find your axis.
