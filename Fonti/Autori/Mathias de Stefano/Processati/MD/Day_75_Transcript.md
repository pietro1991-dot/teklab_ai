## Introduction

Hello , hi everyone. Good morning , good evening , good night. Welcome everybody and thank you all those who are connecting every day.

Today , there is no waiting today. Here it 's getting cooler at night.

So , weddings are only allowed in open places.

So , I guess. I guess. It 's better for me. I think there is a wedding but is n't the other side.

I can hear music.

Sorry , but. I 'm tired. I am a little bit lost because as always , as every day , I just say , oh my god , it 's five minutes to the alignment. I do n't prepare anything.

I just connect.

So , whatever. The topic to discuss today is heroism and heroism is in trim. How is that going with you?

We are going to discuss today is about the evil. It is something that I have spoken about this in previous videos. But I guess it 's something really important to acknowledge , to remember , to understand once again. For all of you who had n't heard this before and for everyone that have heard about this.

And we still do n't catch up. And it 's about the concept of ego that we usually have this ego. Even if it is like kind of a sin and it 's not like that.

Okay.

So , we have to understand what it is. Basically , what we believe about the ego is that it 's something that separate ourselves from the others. And that makes us think that we are better than others. We should think that heroism would be something that we define selfish , like the heroism , like selfish.

Of that person that is willing to have all the things for himself or itself. And the heroism is an heroism. That person that thinks that they are in the center of everything and that nothing else really must besides their own. And the whole history , these two concepts made the created the perception that the ego is like the bad guy of the movie.

So , we usually used to say that from the perspective of religions , of philosophies and spirituality , we have now and of course all the religions in the world. We used to say that the ego is that part of the self that is not thinking about the others , that is not the one helping , that is selfish.

So , we have to read of the ego.

So , as always to understand why we call the ego something bad , something evil. We have to go to the past as always to understand the order of things.

So , basically let 's start about the meaning. The ego is the word for the Greek culture and the Greek languages also , the Latin languages after the Greek to say I.

So , me.

So , when I say ego , Matias is the same as saying it 's me , Matias for I.

So , starting by the basis of all this , ego refers to the person , to the individual.

So , ego is just a prank. That 's it. Simplest that. In our civilization today , we have given a lot of importance to the ego to the individual because as we are doing now , I am speaking to you.

So , you are listening to me because I am here , one person , oneself , talking , showing everything that I am.

Okay , so , there are thousands like me doing the second name in the show media , showing their personalities , their person with the word.

So , this is a civilization that has given a new meaning to the individual.

So , that 's why we call this civilization like an individualistic civilization. Because we have the possibility to talk one by one.

So , the reason why the ego in our civilization is so important is because we are now in the possibility , we have now the possibility that one person can speak with many other people just like this. They are simple.

So , it 's easy for the self , the individual , the personality to everyone. This is something very common for us today , but in history , it has n't been like that. In the very beginning of our cultures and civilization , the main goal was to survive and the group was something really useful for the individuals to survive.

So , it was more important the group of people working together that had done an individual speaking one by one. The group was the most important.

So , if someone put himself over the rest of the group , it 's like giving the back to the group. In the first stages of humanity , you could n't survive by yourself. You needed the group in order to survive winter , to survive a war , to survive hunger , you needed rest in order to stay alive.

So , this creates a concept in the group , the culture and religion , that to be an individual separated from others would be a risk and would be very bad. What this culture and religion said is there is no one better than anyone. In order to keep going , in order to survive , what we have to do is to help one another , is to be there for the other one.

So , we have to share to be all of us together as one. No one is more important. The group is important.

So , with time , this concept created the belief that being an individual was something that.

So , basically , this made the idea that if you were someone saying , I know how to do it better , or I have a better solution , or I want to do something different.

So , you were , how do you say , English , I do n't know , in the word , you were like someone against , blasphemy , someone against the group , like an enemy.

So , from this concept , we have been creating these two different things that we call , heroism and heroism.

So , basically , what , what some of these people realized is that if everybody stays together as one , there is no growth , because everything is kind of the same. But the people that can make the difference , that 's what you say , make the difference , those that are seen , that they can do something different or better. Through time , the new age has inherited this same concept. And still today , they usually say to be selfish , to have ego is something bad.

And you should n't have ego , you have to go away from ego , so you could be free or spiritual. But you have inherited that from religion.

So , what did the spirituality of today made of the heroism and heroism , they made , they made heroism to be as essence , they call it essence. And they made the heroism as empowerment to empower yourself. For sure , you have heard these words of go back to the center , stay in your axis , go back to yourself , back to the part of your heart. All that is heroism trim , because it 's the ego , I , going to the center.

So , go back to the center is heroism trim. It 's very easy. It 's just another name for that.

So , when we used to say , when we used to say , go back to the core , to the center and find the essence within yourself is the same as saying , hey , you ego , go back to the center.

So , and there 's another thing , when you say , empower yourself , you have to empower yourself.

So , you can create your own reality , you can change your world , you can change the reality , you can do whatever you want to do , because you are the creator of everything. That 's , that is called heroism , selfishness. Because the ego moves , and heroism means ego , moving , ism comes from the Greek word movement , the ego is movement , is moving to create.

So , just teach you , Eastern where we have done , just to change the world , the word , to something that we do n't want to hear , and we just call it a little bit better. I do n't know if you know the expression , but I would say , it 's the same shit with a different smell.

So , what is the goal of this month? The goal of this month is the balance , to find the equilibrium.

So , why are we going to dance these concepts? Because what we used to have is these two concepts and balance. And , and this is what we are going to explain now. This is what we used to call heroism and heroism trim.

So , we used to call it the era , the era has a North Pole and a South Pole , and from there it spins over itself , in the same axis of itself. The era is ego centric , ego centric , because it 's just spinning on itself , and the axis of herself , ego centric.

So , in the other hand , what we have is this movement of the era. This movement is called trans , how do you call it in English? I do n't know , translation?

So , this movement is this movement that aids the equinox and solstice , okay? Translations , okay. The translation is the process that creates summer , winter , and so on.

So , this is the movement of the era.

So , we call it heroism , okay? Heroism.

So , basically , the movement of the era is session. I just made a mistake , because translation is to move around , it 's to translate.

So , that 's it.

So , heroism and ego centricism , yeah.

So , what we would say is that the ego centricism is the one that allows the self to be spinning in itself , in the axis , and the other one allows the transformation of the self , concept.

So , heroism allows the transformation.

So , this concept helps us to understand that to be in the center , to have the ego centrist is to be in the axis , in the center of yourself. And also , by the movement of the heroism , I am allowing myself to transform my reality , even if I am still in my center. When do we have the problem? When the axis , the center , is not precisely in the center , is moved.

So , the spin is not in the center , but it 's moving in any direction. And in the other way , in the other hand , the movement of transformation is not in order , but is chaotic , whatever.

Okay. The problem that we have , not heroism and ego centricism. Those are not the problems. The problem is that we have n't been worked properly with these two concepts , denying them in our lives.

So , our center is lost. And our transformation has become in change , which is very different.

So , what do we have to do? We should not eliminate the ego. What we have to do is to balance the ego.

Okay. To eliminate the ego is basically disappear , to not exist.

So , the negative aspects of the heroism and ego centricism that we have is due to the , to the capacity that we have to put them in order to balance , to use them properly. As always , in everything in life , there is no good , no bad. There is only and balanced. One of the most important things that we have to understand in our life for everything is that there is nothing that is bad and nothing that is good.

The only things that are balanced or unbalanced. That 's it.

## Q&A

So , our only task in our life is to balance them. And of course , the question would be , how do we balance them?

So , basically , what we have to do at first is to find the axis of that conflict. And the axis would be the seed , the center , the core of that conflict.

So , once I know about the seed , I start to recognize the purpose.

So , when I understand the purpose , I can see the changes that this axis has created.

So , through the changes that has created in the life , in life , you can understand then how to transform reality from where you have to transform them. And there is the problem that we have in our lives that there is no one way to balance things. That each one of us has a different way to find the balance.

So , that is your task to find. What is your way? One of the things that , of course , we are going to speak a lot of all of this in other videos , because we must , we should. But , do n't make right now the specific questions.

First , you have to acknowledge and understand the map , the basis of all those other questions.

So , once you understand the two main concepts , where the other are born , then you can start to work on that. Let 's go step by step. I was just thinking that , oh my God , I should explain this , this , this , this , this , this , this. But I say , no , wait a moment.

## Daily Practice Elements

We have 270 days more. The vibration for today is fear. The statement for today is , I am connections , flows. Just one thing that I wanted to say.

First of all , thank you for some people that has given me advises of how to make some corrections in English , because of course English is not my language. I am trying to do my best with the English I know that I study in school and in movies.

So , so thank you for some of the advises. But also , I wanted to say that some people were telling me about flux , flux , flux , the word flux , that it 's better to say flow. But I 'm not specifically talking about the flow of things. I 'm talking about specifically more organic.

So , the flux. I 'm , I 'm not talking about specific about the flow in between the things. I want to be more specific.

So , that 's why I 'm using flux more like in a body , like the flux of flux of , of blood or the changes in between the different parts of the body.

Okay.

So , that 's what I was trying to use.

So , that.

So , the code for today is Trinity. And it says , two fourths , no matter which ones , have the potentially to create. And what is created is the neutral product of polarity. This Trinity is the concept of all creation itself.

It 's the concept of all creation. It 's the concept of all creation , all creation of all creation. When I was with I 'm supposed to be 80 years old , but I do n't know. I 'm doing them all.

So , first of all , comfortable , stretch the body , carries the body. And , you 're. And the side relates myself. I let all the weight fall down.

I take your breath , feeling the air coming inside and transforming each one of my organs. Until then. I feel the air , the wind around me , connecting with the wind within me , becoming one. I feel the energy of my body starting to move in the shape of the spiral within my body.

I perceive each one of the colors. I feel the energy of my soul expressing itself through the skin , expanding around with the wind as a twitter with the colors of a rainbow. I take your breath. I put my hands facing the sky at the height of my heart.

## Energy Work

I become aware of the light of the I am shining over me , like a sun coming towards me. I perceive the light coming through my body from the crown through the third eye , throughout heart and anchoring in the plexus with a beautiful yellow light. I perceive my plexus expanding its light , brighter as a sun , feeling of my hands with this beautiful light. I perceive my plexus with this beautiful light that makes them shine like two other suns , stars.

These two suns are the center that reminds me who I am. I feel that one hand I have my egocentrism and in the other one I have my ego in. I recognize that through all my life I have made a bad use of both of them.

Sometimes I have been eccentric and in other times I have been selfish. I become aware that the only one mistake in both of them has been my alliance.

So I become aware that these two concepts are useful for me. I have to be eccentric , remind me that I have to be in my center , I have to find the center of myself. And the egocentrism is reminded me that I can transform myself , that I can empower my being.

So it 's like this , that I will use my sound to balance both of these concepts , to become harmony with everything that I am. I bring my hands to my heart , unifying these two concepts. I can die , unify them with my vibration. I can die , unify them with my vibration.

I can die , unify them with my vibration. I can die , unify them with my vibration. I am the flux of all machines. I am the flux of all connections.

I recognize the power to be in the center. I am stretching and warning. I can come back here and now , opening your eyes. I hope you are all fine.
