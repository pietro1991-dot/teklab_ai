## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra:** `Root`

## Introduction

Hello everyone , morning , noon , evening. I have been the whole day , seated in the same chair , in the same position , looking into the same screen that I 'm doing now.

So a bit tired. I will try to make it short as I always say. Because I want to keep working , because it 's something that I like.

## Energy Work

So root chara today.

So the reason why we are going to speak about work today is because related to the root chara , it means the manifestation. It means the matter , the action , the doing things here , and this reality.

So I recommend you to read blog today , because it 's been so much and so many concepts of work that me and I was like kind of De when I was writing this. And there are so many concepts that I had to go once and again , once and again , to read what I was writing.

So I thought it was amazing to go through the process of how all this works , connect one another and how they show you the origin of the things that we used today. We 're going to start talking about the concept of what work is for us today , because today we say that work is something that dignified the people. This is a concept that we have today , but the concept of work has been changing for so long through history that we need to understand every one of the steps.

So I guess I 'm going to use the board. We 're going to start from the present and we are going to go backwards.

## Q&A

So first of all , let 's remember that today , even if you do n't like it , we are living in a capitalist society , which is global. I was just asking , do you remember why capitalism , but it would be easier if we were 30 people in a classroom with this question.

So remember , capitalism comes from the word capital. Capital means the means city , but the origin of capital comes from capital that is head.

So cap , the head is the one that organized the whole rest of the body.

So the capitalism is the idea that there is one mind that tries to administrated all the resources around and distribute it according to a strategy.

So the capitalism is related to a strategy of resources , an administration of resources.

So for the capitalism , the work , the concept of work , is something that helps you as a tool to create your own resources and to administrated your own resources.

So for the capitalism , the work is like the key of signifying the person to achieve , to have resources and to administrated it by freedom. I 'm not speaking about the capitalism as it works now. I 'm speaking about capitalism as an idea. How it would be better.

So in the other hand , until really short period of time , we have the communism. In the hand of communism , remember that is a community , the origin is to live together to be in union. For the point of view of community , work is also very important , but not to produce resources to grow , but to dignity the soul. Which means that the communism is about understanding that the person is able to create , to manifest , to produce something by its own soul , by its own attributes , and creates the , create something outside.

So it dignified the soul that is able to create , but for the communism that work is not to grow and expand yourself and administrated resources. For because here comes the state and states , I will take everything that you have produced , and I will divide it in equal parts between all the people. That 's not how much you work , you will get the same result always. But the communism say that work is just to dignity the soul of a human to be able to create and the stuff.

So the capitalism is the one looking for the dignity of the body , and the communism is the one looking for the dignity of the soul.

So both of them , both of them says the work to work is the way in which we reach that dignity.

So the work in both systems will be the key to dignity the being , but the capitalism will use the work with competence , competition , and the communism will work it with equality , all being the same.

So the communism ends because basically they work for the community , but they forget the important part of the system , which is that it 's the individual , the one willing to expand and grow , not the group.

So the communism work for the community as something that is growing , all equals. But they missed the part that is the self , the being , the one that pushes the group.

So that 's why all the people were trying to be themselves and communism you ca n't , because that 's not good.

So that 's inner process makes that there 's no production , no growing , so the economic fails and steadily no communism does n't work.

So basically between the capitalism and because the communism fails , the communism thinkers take the energy of the capitalism and they create a new branch that we would call socialism.

So the socialism creates like this middle system in which there 's no competition , but neither , but also you allow the growth of the inner self , of the people. And again , you take the work as a key of dignity. I do n't know if you can see it , but I leave it here anyway so you can have the frame. Communism , souls , dignity , capitalism , bodies , dignity , socialism in the middle , try to find the balance between both of them.

So what is the problem now , socialism does n't work neither , because we are in the 20 first century and this are systems from the 19th century.

So two centuries before.

So this system does n't work anymore for our society today. To have this idea , the communism takes care of the group.

So it does n't care about the individual. I do n't care the individual , says the communism , I care about the group. We need to help all of them. And the capitalism says , I do n't care about , I just care about the individual.

So be free individual , do whatever you want , I do n't care about the group. This is why neither of both of them work , because the capitalism is not taking care of the group and the group needs help , and the communism is not taking care of the individual and the individual needs to grow.

So it does n't work , no matter. And the socialism is saying individuals be free. And let 's take care of the group. With the freedom , takes the wrong thing of both of them , trying to control the individual and to give freedom to the group.

Freedom to the group that control the individual.

So it 's like , so socialism has this conflict. Why?

So why happens this? Because the three ideas are built by by concepts or philosophies that are published.

So what is populism? Populism comes from the word populous Latin that means the people , okay? People.

So what is populism? You have populism in the rights and left , because both of them , even if they are capitalism or communism , are just ideas , are just ideas of the population.

Okay? A population , a big group of people.

So a lot of people share an idea , a philosophy , and instead of taking care of their own philosophy inside , they just are pushed by the main idea of the group.

So that is why they are pushed by the populist , okay? The movement of population is populism.

So why is a populism? Why a populism is born? Because of the unconscious society. The society , the humanity is unconscious.

Why? Because it needs to to survive. It 's looking for survival. Why?

Because we need to eat , we need to deliver stuff.

So we need the group , the family.

Remember , we have been spoken about this. We need the group to take care of us.

So that 's why , through thousands of years , we have created the idea that we need the others in order to survive.

So that 's why when a group thinks in one way , everyone tries to think exactly as the group. Just in case they can die. And that 's how people create an idea. And we call that populism.

Now , why a population a group exists? Because they need to survive in order to have food. They want food.

So they need that food.

So they start to figure out the way in which all this can survive. And the first thing that they do is we need food , something to eat.

So we have to go and hunt. We have to go and so we have to harvest.

So we have to do all the things. And in order to get those products , you have to do many things. Put your strength to work to to dig the ground , to hunt , to have wounds.

So the body starts to hurt , to suffer. In Latin , this physical suffering is called labor. The first labor that we all experience in our lives is given birth. Being birth.

Being born , sorry.

So being born is the first suffering that we have. And that 's what we call the labor of being given birth.

So from that moment on , everything that we have , everything for which we have to suffer to get food or a product for myself , will be called a labor , something that makes me suffer , that has pain on it.

So from that moment , everything that starts to be created is all related to the suffering.

So check the blog in just so you dot red. And there you will find all the explanations of the origin of the words , work , job and so on. First , we go to one of the main of all history , human civilization. The human civilization was divided in different stages.

For sure , you have heard about the concept of the age of iron , the age of bronze when we speak about the human history. And this is because this is because the archaeologist before the carbon 14 tests existed , they could only interpret the times of history according to the metals that humans were using in that period of time.

So the the blacksmith was the most important job in that period of time. And for us it 's really important because that 's how we knew the different ages of humanity in history. The blacksmith , the blacksmith is one of the most important words in history. Because everyone needed a blacksmith to do all their job.

Because the words in the fields , the words in the castle , in the construction , in the kitchen , in the jewelry , all of them need and a blacksmith to do the tools.

So that was the most important job that everyone could have.

Okay.

So that 's why also to be blacksmith is the one that 's with the iron. And iron in Latin is ferry.

So the one that lives on the pressure of the ferry is the suffering , suffering.

So suffering is under the ferry , under the iron , which is suffering. The concept of suffering is the one that is under the pressure of the whole society of the whole work. The blacksmith was the one using this tool in the ancient time that was called tripalium. Trillium is the concept of three pieces of wood , where they used to tie the horses and some animals to work on their pots.

I do n't know the word in English for erasure. If you know like this iron thing that they put on the horses pot.

So they would work with that and yeah horses shoes.

Okay. The tripalium was a tool of blacksmith blacksmith to work with the animal.

So in part times all the tools become weapons.

So the tripalium was used for torture.

So they used to tie people there and they would use the tools of the blacksmith to make bad things to the people.

So now look into this. In the ancient times whoever was the blacksmith , had good job. Has a money and earning and it was good to be a blacksmith because you have many things to do. A lot of money.

So that 's why to have a tripalium was good which creates the word trabalho , trabalho , inspiration and languages.

So it was good to have a tripalium at home because that means that you have work.

Okay. And but in the other hand the same thing the same tool was used to torture.

So that 's why if you have a tripalium was also just for and to create suffering. They are the two origins of the word tripalium. Travailium.

So the word tripalium or , , travail , a travail you say also , travail is something that matches the suffering and the ability to get resources. In English you may use the word travail , travail , , to describe something that is that really hurts , something that is that makes you suffer a lot.

So in the subconscious for the population , the populism , the word , the word , travail , labor is related to the suffering of doing something to accomplish something that you need to work hard to sweat in order to get what you want. The word labor or travail in our substance is related to the concept of those things that I have to do obligated if I do n't want to die to make an effort. In the cultures we created the idea that the person who work who has a labor are the ones that are going to leave fine because they will have white , they will have work to sleep and they will be able to reproduce. This is why work starts to be like a synonym for dignity because because of the work , because of the labor 's I am able to survive.

This is what is used by the communism for the soul and the capitalism for the body. This is the system , the one of the community and the one of the capital creates the concept , they only wait to have dignity , not only wait to have a body is through work , so if you do n't have work you do n't have dignity. You know how it starts to be created. Whoever does n't have a job is expelled from the capitalism slave for the communism.

So there is a more in between these two systems that there is someone that just gets conscious and suddenly that person does n't look into the capitalism of the body and the communism of the soul , it starts to be connected with the unity of the spirit.

So in that moment that person realized about something which is , oh , I am the creator so in that moment is when myself starts to say I can do exactly the same with no need of suffering just with pleasure. This is something that recognize that there 's no need for the soul to leave through others in the community or to compete with others in the capital of the body. The being that becomes aware recognize that there 's no need to survive because the body is eternal.

So you get detached from physical things. You do n't need physical things anymore. You just use physical things for a moment and in the other side there 's no need to be accepted by a work for a group to be. I accept myself.

So from the freedom of my being , I use both systems. When I recognize that I am not in the need of suffering , of survival , a labor , whatever it would be , is that I am the creator of that. I am not suffering anymore.

So I realize that this is my own creation , that this is my design. I am the only one operator of my own reality and operate my own reality. Is the one that feeds the word office? Office comes from the word opus that means opera.

A crap. To operate the master opera.

So the office is the thing that you operate because of yourself because you realize who you are.

So you will become the creator. You become the own creator of your things. When you are pushed by the environment to this something you work , you survive , you are in labor. When you do it by yourself , being aware of what you do.

Your opera , that 's your own operation , your office.

So to wrap this up , remember that to be spiritual is not to let the material world away to live all the physical things and does n't care about the money and all these things. No , to be spiritual is to be coherent , that you are using matter , not matter , is using you. When matter is you , all the weight of the world is on you , the iron of the planet and that 's suffering. But when you create your own reality , using the iron , create things , that 's what you call to have an office , to operate reality.

That 's your opera.

So , so , important this. When you connect with your divine , usually you will start to say , I do n't want to work with this anymore. I want to be free to do whatever I want. And sometimes we think that if we do whatever we want , we want to have the money driving the system or for the system that will be terrible.

The end of the system. But no , when we become aware of ourselves and we do , when we have come to do in this world , when the system starts to work really. Because you are doing when you are supposed to do.

So , that is helpful for the system. The only thing is that when you are supposed to do what you are supposed to do from your inner self , there is no more ideology. It is up here.

So , now , if you ask yourself , well , maybe I want to do this different things. But I need the money , I need to work , I need to do this. In order to accomplish my goal , so if I do n't work , I wo n't have that.

So , the thinking here would be , why do you think that you need to something that is not good for you in order to have things to buy things that are good for you? How is that?

So , for example , myself , I am really well economically. I ca n't complain. But I do work , I have never worked in my life.

Some people say , I am the worker. Never , because what I do is what I am. Since the moment I recognized who I was , I was just doing what I was. That 's it.

And I seem people tell me , but this is not work. You never worked and you leave fine with no work. And I said , yes , because I choose not to suffer. I am all the day doing things , constantly managing , but they are not work.

It 's me. And of course , that scares to be in the edge and saying , what do I do? I know reaching anything , what do I do? But remember , you are the creator.

We are the creator.

So , if you create fear , you will have fear. I spoke even more that I expected. And this is because I enjoyed. I 'm not working.

## Daily Practice Elements

And I 'm grateful for the day is both. The statement for today is I am the universal child 's home. The code for today is destiny. The extremes of this path or strings of the web are called destiny.

In place it is in them , exist the word purpose. If we take a note , the string and another note , we can interpret that in geometry , exist an origin , a path , and a destiny. But that origin turns at the same time into another destiny in the patterns. This all become a purpose.

Destiny is then not a final but part of an integration and comprehension process within the relative path.

So let 's go to the lineman. We see it properly. We see it comfortable. And and I was going to say and pause your eyes.

Sorry. It was suddenly I was thinking and it could n't speak English. Everybody is here this morning. Take a deep breath , and pay attention to the environment you find yourself in and use your imagination.

To the sign , and very dark night , with a big dark sky , full of stars. It 's in front of you. In the center , there is a fire. I feel the fire in my hands.

It 's heat. In my chest , on my face. And I feel surrounded by other people. I perceive the deep light of the fire , yellow or ancient red , and the flames moving like snakes.

I observe the circle of people around the fire , all seated together under the stars. I recognize that the people around the fire are all those that represent my coworkers. I share the work with employees , bosses , friends , partners , patients , clients , all the people that represent the work. I recognize that when it comes to me , the fire is what connects me to all of them.

## Q&A

The workplace and the light , the flames represent my office , my own hobby. But I really love to do. Watch the fire and ask yourself , what is what I love to do the most? What is my attributes , my office , my profile?

I am three. I am free from all this flames with all these people to do what I like , but I have come here to do. I am really free to manifest , to create , to do what I like. I recognize that all the people around you are the kids of the universe that go together here to find a way to get what they need.

I am really happy to be able to do what I like , to be able to do what I like , to be able to do what I like. I am suffering , feeling trapped in your work , or you feel expanded and free growing through it. Is your job a condition of the work? Or it is your own creation?

I observe again deep in the fire that office that is mine , where I find myself , free , expanded. And with my singing , I absorb this light inside of my body. I am really happy to be able to do what I like , to be able to do what I like , to be able to do what I like. And my office becomes my home , and the workers become free children of the cosmos.

I am the home of the Universal Children. I am the home of the Universal Children. I am the home of the Universal Children. I am the children home to me , for I am freedom.

I am the home of the Universal Children. I am the home of the Universal Children. I am the home of the Universal Children. I am the home of the Universal Children.

Thank you for being here. See you tomorrow.
