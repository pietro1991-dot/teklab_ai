## Overview

On January 17th, Matias addresses the **Root Chakra** with a profound exploration of what **work** truly means—not just economically, but philosophically and spiritually. The Root Chakra represents manifestation, matter, action, and doing things in this reality. This teaching traces the evolution of work from feudalism through the Industrial Revolution to modern capitalism, communism, and socialism, revealing that **all three systems fail** because they're built on outdated 19th-century philosophies that don't serve 21st-century humanity.

The core revelation: **Capitalism dignifies the body** (resources, administration, freedom), **Communism dignifies the soul** (ability to create, expression), and **Socialism tries to balance both but fails** because it controls the individual while giving freedom to the group. The teaching exposes how work has been weaponized through **populism**—using work as a political tool to manipulate people—and reveals the etymological origins of "work," "labor," "office," and "opera" to show how these concepts have been distorted over time.

This is a call to **resign the philosophy of work itself**, not just switch between broken systems, and to understand that true work is about **conscious creation and contribution**, not competition or survival.

## Core Teaching

### The Modern Context: Living in Global Capitalism

Today, whether we like it or not, we live in a **capitalist society that is global**. To understand what this means, we must return to the origin of the word.

**Capitalism** comes from **capital**, which means "head city"—but the origin comes from **caput** (Latin for "head"). The **cap/head** is the one that organizes the whole rest of the body.

**Capitalism is the idea that there is one mind that tries to administer all the resources around and distribute them according to a strategy.** Capitalism is related to a **strategy of resources**, an **administration of resources**.

### Capitalism's View of Work

For capitalism, **work is a tool** that helps you create your own resources and administer your own resources.

**Work is the key to dignifying the person to achieve, to have resources, and to administer them by freedom.**

*Important note:* Matias clarifies, "I'm not speaking about capitalism as it works now. I'm speaking about capitalism as an idea—how it would be better."

### Communism's View of Work

Until a relatively short period of time, we had **communism**. Remember that communism comes from **community**—the origin is to **live together, to be in union**.

From the point of view of community, **work is also very important, but not to produce resources to grow**—rather, **to dignify the soul**.

Communism understands that the person is able to **create, to manifest, to produce something by its own soul, by its own attributes**, and create something outside. **Work dignifies the soul** that is able to create.

**But for communism, that work is not to grow and expand yourself and administer resources.** The state comes and says: "I will take everything that you have produced, and I will divide it in equal parts between all the people." No matter how much you work, you will get the same result always.

**Communism says work is to dignify the soul** of a human to be able to create and produce.

### The Two Dignifications

**Summary:**
- **Capitalism** = dignity of the **body** (resources, growth, freedom)
- **Communism** = dignity of the **soul** (creation, expression, manifestation)

**Both systems say work is the way in which we reach that dignity.** Work, in both systems, is **the key to dignify the being**—but capitalism uses work with **competition**, and communism works with **equality** (all being the same).

### Why Communism Failed

Communism ends because they **work for the community but forget the individual**—the one willing to expand and grow. It's not the group that grows; it's **the self, the being, that pushes the group**.

In communism, you can't be yourself because "that's not good." This inner process creates a situation where there's **no production, no growing**, so the economy fails. Steadily, communism doesn't work.

### The Birth of Socialism

Between capitalism (which won) and communism (which failed), communist thinkers took the energy of capitalism and created a new branch: **socialism**.

Socialism creates a **middle system** in which:
- There's no competition
- But you also allow the growth of the inner self, of the people
- Again, you take work as a key of dignity

### The Problem with Socialism

Socialism doesn't work either, because **we are in the 21st century and these are systems from the 19th century**—two centuries before. These systems don't work anymore for our society today.

**The fundamental conflict:**
- **Communism** takes care of the **group**: "I don't care about the individual, I care about the group. We need to help all of them."
- **Capitalism** takes care of the **individual**: "I don't care about the group, I just care about the individual. Be free, individual, do whatever you want."

**Neither works** because:
- Capitalism is not taking care of the group, and the group needs help
- Communism is not taking care of the individual, and the individual needs to grow

**Socialism says:** "Individuals, be free. And let's take care of the group."

But socialism **takes the wrong thing from both of them**—trying to **control the individual** and give **freedom to the group**. Freedom to the group that controls the individual. Socialism has this conflict.

### Why This Happens: Populism

**Why does this happen?** Because all three ideas are built by **populism**—concepts or philosophies that are populist.

**What is populism?**

Populism comes from **populus** (Latin for "people"). Populism is the philosophy or ideology that **tries to help people, tries to solve people's problems**.

But the key problem with populism is: **it uses people's needs to make politics**. Populism takes what people need and uses it as a **political weapon** to manipulate and control them.

**Populism is not about solving problems—it's about using problems to gain power.**

All three systems—capitalism, communism, and socialism—are built on populist philosophies. They all **use work as a political tool** to control people rather than truly dignifying them.

### The Etymology of Work

To understand how work has been distorted, we must look at the **origin of the word**.

**Work** comes from different roots:

1. **Labor** (Latin "laborare") = to toil, to struggle, to suffer
   - Related to the idea of **effort, pain, hardship**
   - This is the root of "labor" in English and many Romance languages

2. **Opera** (Latin) = work, effort, service, exertion
   - **Opera = the action of creating something**
   - This is where we get "operate," "operation," "opus"
   - **Opera is creation, manifestation**

3. **Office** (Latin "officium") = duty, service, function
   - **Office comes from "opus" (work) + "facere" (to do)**
   - **Officium = to do the work, to perform the function**
   - Originally meant: the duty to serve, the function you perform for the community

**The revelation:** The word **office** and the word **opera** come from the same root—**opus** (work as creation, as service, as contribution to the whole).

### Work as Opera vs. Work as Labor

There are **two ways to understand work:**

**1. Work as Opera (Creation)**
- Work is the **action of creating something**
- Work is **manifestation of your soul's abilities**
- Work is **contribution to the collective**
- Work is **service to the community**
- Work is **dignification through creation**

**2. Work as Labor (Suffering)**
- Work is **toil, struggle, pain**
- Work is **something you must do to survive**
- Work is **punishment or burden**
- Work is **competition for resources**
- Work is **forced by necessity**

**The question becomes:** Are you working as **opera** (creating, serving, manifesting) or as **labor** (struggling, suffering, competing)?

### The Distortion of Office

Today, when we think of **office**, we think of:
- A building where you work
- A corporate job
- A desk, a computer, paperwork
- 9-to-5 routine
- Bureaucracy

**But the original meaning of office was:** the **duty to perform your function** for the community, the **service** you offer through your unique abilities.

**Office was meant to be your opera**—your creative contribution, your service, your manifestation in the world.

**Today, office has become labor**—a place of toil, struggle, competition, and survival.

### The Root Chakra Connection

The **Root Chakra** is about **manifestation, matter, action**—doing things here in this reality.

**Work is the primary way we manifest in the material world.** Through work, we:
- Create physical results
- Contribute to the collective
- Use our bodies and skills
- Ground our spiritual abilities into matter
- Participate in the web of exchange and contribution

**This is why work is a Root Chakra topic.** It's about **how we ground our being into the world**, how we **manifest our soul's creativity** in physical form.

### The 21st Century Crisis

**We are in the 21st century using 19th-century philosophies.**

All three systems—capitalism, communism, socialism—were created 150-200 years ago for a world that **no longer exists**.

**The world has changed:**
- We have technology
- We have global connection
- We have new forms of exchange
- We have new understandings of consciousness
- We have new possibilities for organization

**But we're still using the same old philosophies of work**, the same old systems of economy, the same old ideas of competition vs. cooperation.

**This doesn't work.**

### What Must Change

**Matias is clear:** We don't need to go back to communism systems of the past (which were related to fields and specific situations of that time). Today has changed—it's different.

**We should not go back to old systems.**

**What we have to do is resign/transform the CONCEPT of work**, not the system.

**Resign the philosophies of the system.**

It's not about choosing capitalism vs. communism vs. socialism. **It's about creating an entirely new understanding of what work means**, what contribution means, what creation means in the 21st century.

### Humanism Beyond Systems

Matias shares a personal reflection: Friends say he's very socialist. He responds: "No, I'm the least socialist of all. I'm a **humanist**, which is different—maybe socialism has some things there, but I'm neither capitalist."

**We usually want to classify people into systems.** But the future is not about choosing a system—it's about **humanist understanding** that transcends all these broken philosophies.

**Humanism means:** caring for both the **individual** (their growth, freedom, creativity) and the **collective** (their needs, support, connection)—not through control or competition, but through **conscious co-creation**.

### The Call to Transformation

This teaching is a call to **question everything we've been taught about work**:
- Why do we work?
- What is work for?
- Who benefits from our work?
- Are we working as opera (creation) or labor (suffering)?
- Are we dignifying our body, our soul, or both?
- Are we controlled by populist systems that use our needs against us?

**The Root Chakra asks us to ground our consciousness into matter**—but **consciously**, not as slaves to broken systems.

**Work can be our greatest expression of creation and service**, or it can be our greatest source of suffering and control.

**The choice is ours to make.**

## Practice

### Reflection on Your Work

**Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Take deep breaths.**

1. **Ask yourself:** What is my relationship with work?
   - Do I see work as opera (creation, service, manifestation)?
   - Or do I see work as labor (toil, struggle, survival)?

2. **Notice your body's response** as you think about your work.
   - Does your Root Chakra feel grounded and empowered?
   - Or does it feel constricted and controlled?

3. **Recognize the system** you've been living in.
   - Have you been competing (capitalism)?
   - Have you been suppressing yourself for the group (communism)?
   - Have you been caught in the contradiction (socialism)?

4. **Imagine a new way** of working.
   - What would it feel like to work as **opera**—as creation, as service?
   - What would it feel like to dignify both your **body** (through resources and freedom) and your **soul** (through creative expression)?

5. **Affirm:** **"I Am the Home of Universal Children"**
   - You are the **home** where new possibilities are born
   - You are the **space** where universal creativity manifests
   - You are the **ground** where new systems can grow

6. **Ground this into your Root Chakra.**
   - Feel the earth beneath you
   - Feel your connection to matter, to manifestation, to physical reality
   - Know that your work is your **contribution to the whole**

7. **Breathe and return** to the present moment.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Throughout the day, observe your relationship with work:**

1. **Notice when you feel like you're doing labor** (struggling, suffering, competing)
   - What thoughts arise? What beliefs about work are you holding?

2. **Notice when you feel like you're doing opera** (creating, serving, manifesting)
   - What's different? How does your body feel? What shift has occurred?

3. **Ask yourself:** "Am I working to dignify my body, my soul, or both?"

4. **Recognize populist conditioning:**
   - When do you feel manipulated by the need to work?
   - When do you feel controlled by economic systems?
   - When do you feel your work is being used against you?

5. **Practice conscious choice:**
   - Even in a broken system, can you choose to work as opera internally?
   - Can you bring consciousness to your creation and contribution?
   - Can you ground your spiritual understanding into your material actions?

### Applying This Teaching

- **Read the full blog post** at justsoy.red (choose your language) for deeper exploration of work, populism, and the evolution of economic systems
- **Question the systems** you've inherited without accepting them blindly
- **Recognize you are the home of universal children**—new possibilities for work and contribution are born through your consciousness
- **Use your Root Chakra** to ground new understandings of work into your daily life
- **Remember:** You don't have to choose between broken systems; you can create new ways of understanding work, creation, and contribution

### Capricorn Emotional Week

This is part of understanding how we **use** our emotions and relationships with the material world. Capricorn asks: **"What is this useful for?"** 

Work is meant to be **useful**—but useful for what? For competition? For survival? For control?

Or useful for **creation, service, and the dignification of both body and soul**?

**The choice defines everything.**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: Why do all three systems—capitalism, communism, and socialism—fail?

Because they're all built on **19th-century populist philosophies** that use work as a political weapon to manipulate people. Capitalism only cares for the individual and ignores the group. Communism only cares for the group and suppresses the individual. Socialism tries to balance both but ends up controlling the individual while giving freedom to the group. **None of them truly dignify both body and soul simultaneously.**

### Q: What is the difference between work as "opera" and work as "labor"?

**Opera** (from Latin "opus") means work as **creation, service, manifestation**—the dignification of the soul through creative contribution. **Labor** (from Latin "laborare") means work as **toil, struggle, suffering**—something you must do to survive. Opera dignifies both body and soul; labor creates suffering and competition.

### Q: What is populism and why is it a problem?

Populism comes from "populus" (people). It's a philosophy that **claims to help people and solve their problems, but actually uses people's needs as a political weapon** to manipulate and control them. All three economic systems—capitalism, communism, socialism—are built on populist foundations, which is why they all fail to truly serve humanity.

### Q: If capitalism, communism, and socialism all fail, what's the alternative?

**Not another system, but a transformation of the concept itself.** Matias calls for **resigning the philosophy of work**—not going back to old systems, but creating an entirely new 21st-century understanding of what work means. This understanding must dignify both the **individual** (growth, freedom, creativity) and the **collective** (needs, support, connection) through **conscious co-creation**, not control or competition. He identifies as a **humanist**, beyond all system classifications.

### Q: How does the Root Chakra relate to work?

The Root Chakra is about **manifestation, matter, action**—doing things in this reality. **Work is the primary way we manifest in the material world.** Through work, we ground our spiritual abilities into physical form, create results, contribute to the collective, and participate in the web of exchange. The question is: **Are we manifesting consciously (as opera) or unconsciously (as labor)?**

### Q: What does "I Am the Home of Universal Children" mean?

You are the **home** (the space, the ground, the foundation) where **universal children** (new possibilities, new creations, new systems) are born. You are not bound to the old systems; you are the **birthplace of new understanding**. Through your consciousness and your work, new ways of being, creating, and contributing can manifest in the world.

### Q: Why does Matias say he's a "humanist" rather than capitalist or socialist?

Because **classification into systems is part of the problem.** Being "humanist" means caring for both the **individual** and the **collective** without being trapped in the philosophical frameworks of capitalism, communism, or socialism. It's about **transcending broken systems** and creating new understanding based on what truly serves human consciousness, growth, and dignity—both body and soul.

### Q: How can we practice this teaching in a world still dominated by capitalist systems?

Even within broken systems, you can bring **consciousness** to your work:
- Recognize when you're being manipulated by populist conditioning
- Choose internally to work as **opera** (creation, service) rather than **labor** (suffering, competition)
- Ground your spiritual understanding into material actions
- Ask constantly: "Am I dignifying my body, my soul, or both?"
- Be the **home** where new possibilities are born, even if you can't change the external system immediately

**Consciousness transforms work from within, even before external systems change.**
