## Overview

Day 37 brings us to the root chakra and genitals, the foundation of our being, where our **attributes**—our strengths and weaknesses—are anchored. Matias begins with a humorous note about forgetting his microphone ("for sure next month I will forget about the camera, I don't know") and acknowledges that the Virgo lists are hard, but they're "nothing compared with Capricorn—just wait for it."

This day introduces one of the most sophisticated cosmological teachings of the series: **everything that exists is basically light**. We are waves, frequencies, photons expressing through different densities. The light spectrum, with its wavelengths and frequencies, becomes the master metaphor for understanding not just physical reality but emotional and spiritual states.

The revolutionary reframe is this: **enlightenment doesn't mean escaping the physical to become pure light. We already ARE light.** The question is whether we're vibrating in resonance or dissonance with the wave we're part of. Enlightenment is achieving harmonic resonance with the light that already constitutes us.

The teaching then pivots to the wave-and-valley metaphor. Our strengths are like being on top of a mountain—we can see everything, we have clarity, but there's no food there, nothing grows. Our weaknesses are like being in the valley—limited vision, surrounded by mountains, but this is where life grows, where nourishment exists. **We need both.** The mistake is trying to stay permanently on the mountaintop.

Depression, in this model, is the descent into the valley. If we descend unconsciously, resisting the whole way, it's painful and disorienting. If we descend consciously, knowing we're going down to gather what we need before climbing back up, it becomes purposeful. The key is not to avoid the valley but to go down with awareness, gather resources, and use the momentum of the descent to power the next ascent.

The task is brutally honest: write down your strengths and your weaknesses without judgment. Not to fix them, but to identify where you are on the wave at this moment.

## Core Teaching

### Forgetting the Microphone and Preparing for Capricorn

Matias starts with self-deprecating humor: "Good morning, good evening, good night to everyone. Today I forgot the mic, for sure. Next month I will forget about the camera, I don't know."

He acknowledges: "I know maybe it's being hard, the list of Virgo. I know for all the spiritual people working for the consciousness, Virgo is very difficult. But this is nothing compared with Capricorn. Just wait for it."

Looking ahead: "January is going—for sure it will be a very strong year in every sense."

### The Spectrum of Light: We ARE Light

Let's begin today with our issue—the root chakra in the mental, the mind week. Matias hopes we were able to read the blog today, though he knows it's too much. His intention was to write just a paragraph each day for the month, but "suddenly I can't stop, so it's long. Sorry."

He was trying to explain something: **The image shared today in the blog helps a lot to understand how we can get the idea of what are our strengths and our weakness.**

The image is related to the spectrum of light going through the space. This reality is moving like a wave—the longitudinal wave, the wavelength of wave. **Why is it important to understand the spectrum of light? This wavelength?**

The importance of it is to realize that **everything that exists is basically light. Everything that moves through the space and creates energy is basically built by photons.**

Photons are the particles—the main particle of light. These photons are the energy that makes the atoms move through the magnetism. This vibration that creates everything, that creates every atom, every molecule—everything has photons. The photons go through it. Basically, it creates us. **We are light.**

### Enlightenment as Resonance, Not Escape

To understand that everything that creates us, basically, is made of light helps us change the idea of what enlightenment means.

We, in this kind of path, usually are willing to get enlightened or to find the illumination. **We ARE light.** Light goes through us. We should not go to look for the enlightenment. **We just have to go in the same vibration, the waves of the light, to see the enlightenment.**

Basically, the reason we don't find illumination, we cannot reach enlightenment, is basically we are not balanced with the vibration of the light we are. **We are dissonant to the wave. We cannot see it. We cannot perceive it.**

Basically, we should not make a path outside to find enlightenment. **We have to make the path within to balance myself, so I can get enlightened, so I can find the light.**

### Frequency: The Key Word

One of the keywords to understand the process of how to do it is the word **frequency**.

Here we have some misunderstanding about what frequency means. We usually think when we speak about frequency, we are talking about energy or the vibration we make. We make a mistake. We kind of say "the frequency of music," "the frequency of my energy," "I am vibrating in this frequency."

**Frequency—we usually made a mistake believing that means the vibration. It's not bad.** In order to understand how the frequency works, we have to go to a short sentence that maybe makes the summary of everything:

**"Frequently, you do an action."**

In this sentence, "frequently" is talking about the aspect of: frequency means **the period of time you need in a process to get to the other point.**

That's why we say "frequency of time," "how frequent you do this." That period of time happens in the process of vibration. This is why we misunderstand the concept.

We could say, by—**vibration is space. Frequency is time.** Do you see the difference?

### The Sea Metaphor: Vibration and Frequency

Just picture the image: The frequency would be like the wave moving constantly. Picture when you have a wave, like in an ocean, like in the sea. The lower one is having all the strength, the pressure, to push the one up to move forward. When it goes up, the one that is down pushes the wave into that direction. Would be like inertia.

Imagine the sea is the vibration. The sea is like a space, something physical. Each time one goes down, press the other, the upper one can move forward. This vibration is constant.

To understand the frequency, we would have to picture **the tides of the sea**. Imagine the tides are those that goes to the beach, go down, go back again, once again, goes back again, once and again, once and again, to the beach, then to the sea.

**The tide has a period of time between each other.** We can count in the movement of the waves: If I have a very low sea, a very quiet sea, the vibration would be very soft. Imagine when you have like—this is the wave. If it's a calm sea, you would see the movement will be very soft.

When the wave is moving, pushing the others down, the other one will take a while to rise up, then goes down again, very slow. It will take a long time to make the process.

Imagine, of course, the sea—yeah, the sea is the vibration. This doesn't matter how it moves—it's vibration. If I to measure the frequency, I have to say—I have to do is to kind of count how many seconds I can count from the moment one starts to go down and this one starts to go up.

For example, I can count: one, two, three, four. Then it starts again going down. One, two, three, four. **All this process gives me the idea that each four seconds, the cycle will be repeated. The frequency of my vibration would be each four seconds.**

This is the difference between vibration and frequency. **Frequencies: time. Vibration is space.**

### High Frequency Means Fast Cycles

Imagine if the vibration rises—if there is more vibration, more vibration, each time more. What happens is the frequency starts to be shorter. I don't have time to count, so it's too fast. I cannot keep counting. It's very fast.

This is what we call **low frequency**—low frequency is going too slow. As shorter it gets, the period of the waves, the frequency will be more high. We have high frequency, low frequency, or medium frequency.

Because time and space are related to each other as one, this is why we also say low vibration, medium vibration, or high vibration. We will have to understand that both of them act in a different way, in kind of a different way.

### The Red, Orange, Magenta Universes Revisited

Do you remember in another video I explained about these different universes—one red, the other one is orange? We have these different realities. The meaning of it is each one of them will have its own reality. They all will be different. All of them are all together in the same length of wavelength.

Once you got the idea, just try to picture: You say, "You have to rise your vibration. You could go into another dimension." This is a kind of mistaken concept.

**What it means to raise your frequency, to your vibration, to go into another dimension, is not to leave this dimension to go into another one.** Once you know the concept of the vibration works, you just have to know: in order to change your dimension, **you just need to vibrate faster**.

When you vibrate faster, the frequency starts to be shorter. You are able to see something different—a new reality of yourself.

### Past, Present, Future as Frequency States

This is kind of like saying: I want to see the gamma rays or the infrared rays. I cannot do it. I'm not prepared for this unless I start to vibrate in the same frequency as them.

This is why there is no other dimensions apart from ours. **The only thing that exists is just one wave of vibration in which we all are vibrating in different time frames of frequency.**

This is why we also say time and space are relative. They are happening right now because it's not like saying the past has happened. **The past is just a low vibration you cannot see, you cannot touch it. The future is so fast, the vibration is like, like, that I cannot even perceive it.**

Now, let's go to the tiny part, the specific of frequency we can see—the one we call present. This tiny part allows us to see different aspects through different frequencies.

### The Rainbow in Our Body: The Chakras

Do we see? This part, this part of the frequency we see it like a rainbow in our body. We see the rainbow projected as the chakras.

What are the chakras? **The chakras are just the expression of a whole wave that can be expressed in this part.** The vibration is the medium. It allows the vibration of the atoms to stabilize, to be kind of in balance. They has the appearance of matter. That's why we exist.

We are just a projection of light. The only reason we exist physically is through the vibration. In our spectrum of light, the atoms, instead of being vibrating like crazy, they started to calibrate and balance. We can see it. We can see us, touch us, just that the atoms are in order.

Now, in this tiny aspect of light, we have 12 waves. Let's remember we are coming from a very low vibration, are like the medium, then the higher one already carries.

**We are in the middle. We have—in this spectrum of vibration, the experience of 12 chakras, 12 waves of vibration.** Each one of them are located in our body—like the seven chakras within our body, the two in the legs (nine), the other one irradiating through the skin, the other one below our feet, the other one up on our head. We have 12 chakras in our spectrum.

Remember, these 12 chakras will have 12 notes, also 12 colors.

### The Symphony of the Self

Remember, each one of these chakras is a wave. Now picture that the wave is coming. Rise up as the upper chakra, the one over ahead. Then starts to go down. At the moment it goes down, it's pushing and rising up the crown chakra. When the crown chakra goes down, the low vibration of the crown chakra starts to rise the third eye. Then it goes down again. The low energy of the third eye makes up the vibration of the throat. And so on.

You got the picture. **All the waves means our self, our being, is vibrating as a symphony.**

Let's talk about the unconscious way of vibrating. If I am unaware of myself, if I am unconscious, if I start to vibrate faster and faster and faster, what I do is I'm not able to do any process. **I stress myself. I cannot manifest anything. I'm too fast.**

One of the clues to understand these in our own lives is we project constantly in the future. We are not being able to manifest anything in the present.

If we, through unconscious, vibrate very low, the process—to take the time you need to get a process—would take years. It's very slow. You usually are related to the past. You are always living constantly in the same way of the past. You're constantly saying like, "Oh, it was better," or "what happened to me was terrible," always thinking in the past.

### Living in Balance: Past, Present, Future as Continuum

In order to normally live in balance, what I have to do is not to cut the past and the future. I have to do is to realize **the energy that is coming from the past is part of the wave I need to use** in order to start to balance, to balance myself, calibrate myself, in order to be aligned with the future energy.

It's a continuum. In order to be conscious, what I have to do is to recognize my past, the energy that comes to me, recognize my present, and then to put myself a goal in the future. We have seen all this.

### The 12 Chakras and Identifying Attributes

So let's go again to the 12. In this specific moment, one of the main things I have to do to understand is: first, to analyze **in what aspect of my life these chakras are in the top of the wave—that would be my strength. Which ones in the low part of the wave—that would be my weakness.**

The image would be: I recognize the strength in the top of the wave or the hill. I can see everything. I can see everything from above. When I have strength, I can see and say, "This is the truth. I am higher, so I see everything."

If I go down, I'm in the valley. Through the valley, I only see these mountains around. I cannot see perfectly what is happening. **I am weak. I don't know what to do.**

### Mountains and Valleys: Strength and Weakness

Let's picture as if they are mountains, these things—mountains and valleys. **We usually want to stay on the top of the mountain because it's the one you have clarity. But you don't have nothing to eat. You cannot make grow anything.**

In order to get food, you have to go down the hill, pick up food, and come back again to the top. Nobody wants to stay on the top of the mountain looking into everything. "I can see everything, but I won't be able to survive. They don't have anything to eat."

I have to make the effort to go down. **This is the effort we used to call the depression—going down to the valley.**

The depression is the act we take in order to grab all the things we need in order to have success on the top of the hill.

### Conscious Descent vs. Unconscious Descent

The biggest conflict we have in this movement is we go down the hill or going up the hill not knowing anything of what I am doing. If I have no idea of what I'm doing, the next time I'm trying to go up the hill, I will be like, "Why? You wouldn't have any idea of what—why did I came? Why did I come?"

So suddenly, I started to fight against going down the hill, to going to the valley. "I don't want to go down anymore."

This concept is like **trying constantly to make us try to be happy**. That's what we call **the pursuit of happiness**. What we're trying to do is like trying to jump from one top of the hill to the other without food, without energy.

**The thing that we need to do is to go down the hill running, grabbing all we need, and with that impulse, to go up the hill. The strength we have going down faster makes us go up faster too.**

This is this, this. This is what—when we go down the valley, we become consciousness. **We shouldn't try to escape from that reality. We have to do is to try to think about: What have we come to look for? What do we need to find?**

You go—you do the inner process. If you ever feel sad or tired with this and just can't anymore, you get into depression, you shouldn't stop it. You shouldn't stop that and say, "No, I can't feel this. I have to be happy."

**No. With consciousness, you just sit down. You just lay down your bed and just allow yourself to feel. And try to just look within: What are you looking for?**

### Finding What We Need in the Valley

If you feel the energy, the situation of weakness is you have a lack of something. You need to find the something. **The only way you can do it is by allowing you to feel into the depth the energy.**

The people that are suffering from a very heavy depression constantly is they have been their whole life or even through generations to stop it, not to think about what they needed. They were trying to hide their needs to be stronger.

If you wouldn't—if all your history was trying to avoid the reality, suddenly you, the last one, have to go down the hill very fast, the deep, in order to be able to balance, to calibrate all these waves we are.

First, you need to identify **what are your strength, where are your weakness**. This is why the task for today is to write down a list. What you can find are your weakness, which are your strengths.

Don't think about to calibrate this now. It's just to identify. We will pick this issue again in the month of Libra.

## Practice

### Preparation

Remember, we start by doing massage, caressing the body. Remember we thank to the physical body for being the anchor of the spirit undermined in the matter. Focus very deep in my breathing. Feel the air, the oxygen, comes within through your nose, lungs, heart, blood, organs, and muscles.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Root Chakra

1. **Feel the heat expanding.** Allow myself to feel the heat within my body, how it goes out through my skin, filling up my aura and all my magnetical field.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Think about the I Am as a light over your head. With each breathing, bring all the heat and the energy around my body towards the I Am, the higher self, as a spiral, fitting the light, making it brighter and brighter.

3. **Descend through all chakras.** Allow myself to bring the light of the I Am through all my body. Take a deep breath: third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacrum, root. Yes, knees, feet.

4. **Light the root and genitals.** Feel the light of the I Am within my body, taking all the information from the mind we have worked with all these 10 days. Aside, feel the I am touching all that information.

5. **Accept all information.** Recognize what it is really doing is to accept all the information is within me. I feel—help—for my feet, the energy starts to go out, going up and around my body as an egg of light, surrounding me, coming again to my head. Use my hands if needed to touch it, to feel it, and help it to get to my crown. I Am. I Am.

6. **Recognize the magnetical field.** I accept—I Am. All around my magnetical field is the information of everything that makes me be. I Am. The light of the I Am, the consciousness, allows me to accept I Am.

7. **Pronounce the vibration.** Take a deep breath. Start to make the sound, the vibration, that comes from my body towards all the directions, towards the eternity of my being: **No... No... No... No...**

8. **Embrace all worlds/dimensions.** Take a deep breath. Taking a deep breath, recognize, saying it towards all the directions, the eternity of myself: "I am the Emissary of Eternity. I am the Emissary of Eternity. I am the Emissary of Eternity. I am the Emissary of Eternity."

### Closing

Take a deep breath. We take our hands to our hearts. Recognize: "The only way to transform the I Am is by accepting the I Am. There's no way to transform myself into something different if I first to love myself, accept myself, recognize myself. I accept I Am. And I accept who I Am here and now. I am the Emissary of Eternity. I am the Emissary of Eternity. I am the Emissary of Eternity."

It is—I take the consciousness with my hands to every part of my body. Stretching, caressing, massaging, yawning, we come back and gently open my eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write down a list of your strengths and your weaknesses.

**Strengths:** The areas where you have clarity, where you can see far, where you feel capable and competent. These are the mountaintops.

**Weaknesses:** The areas where you feel limited, where you can't see clearly, where you struggle or need help. These are the valleys.

Don't judge these. Don't try to fix anything yet. Just identify accurately: Where am I on the mountaintop? Where am I in the valley?

Remember, you need both. The valley has the food. The mountain has the view. The circuit requires going up and down consciously, not trying to stay permanently in one state.

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice when you're resisting descent. When something starts to go "wrong," when energy drops, when you feel yourself going into the valley—do you fight it? Do you immediately try to "fix" your mood, force positivity, escape into distraction?

What if instead, you consciously descended? "Okay, I'm going down. What do I need to gather here? What am I looking for in this valley?"

Also notice when you're on a mountaintop of strength. Can you see clearly from here? Can you use this vantage point to understand the terrain? And can you accept that eventually, you'll need to descend again to gather resources?

The teaching says the strength we have going down faster makes us go up faster too. Consider: What if depression, sadness, difficulty aren't problems to fix but necessary descents to gather what we need for the next ascent? What if the issue isn't that we descend but that we descend unconsciously, not knowing why we're there or what we're looking for?

## Q&A

### Q: If we're already light and already enlightened, why do we need to do anything?

Because we're dissonant with the wave we're part of. Imagine you're a musical note, but you're out of tune with the symphony. You're still music, but you create discord instead of harmony. Enlightenment isn't becoming something you're not—it's coming into resonance with what you already are. The work is calibration, not transformation from one substance to another.

### Q: What's the practical difference between saying "past is low vibration" versus "past is in the past"?

Huge. If past is "in the past," it's done, over, unreachable, separate from now. If past is low vibration happening now, it means the energy from past events is still vibrating in you in the present moment. You can work with it now. You can transform it now. It's not locked away in history—it's a frequency you're still playing. Same with future anxiety: it's not about events that haven't happened yet; it's about high-vibration energy creating static in your present experience.

### Q: How do I know if I'm in a valley or just being lazy/depressed in an unhealthy way?

In the valley consciously, you're gathering something. You're looking for what you need. You're aware you're down and you're asking, "What's here for me?" In unconscious depression, you're just sitting in the valley resisting being there, wishing you were on the mountain, not looking for anything, not gathering. The difference is awareness and purpose, not the feeling itself. Both might feel heavy, but one is active even in stillness, the other is paralyzed.

### Q: The teaching says "allow yourself to feel" depression instead of stopping it. Isn't that dangerous?

There's a difference between allowing yourself to feel and wallowing without boundary. Conscious feeling has a container: "I'm going to sit with this for 30 minutes and really feel into what I'm looking for." "I'm going to let myself cry and ask what these tears are teaching me." Unconscious depression has no boundary—it's an endless pit you fall into without awareness. The teaching isn't "give up and stay depressed forever." It's "stop fighting the descent long enough to understand why you're there and what you need."

### Q: If strengths and weaknesses are both necessary, why does it feel like weakness is bad?

Cultural conditioning. We've been taught the mountain is good, the valley is bad. Success is good, failure is bad. Clarity is good, confusion is bad. But you can't live on the mountain—there's no sustenance there. The valley is where life grows, where resources are, where the work of transformation happens. Weakness isn't failure; it's the part of the cycle where you're vulnerable enough to receive, to be taught, to gather what you can't get from a position of strength.

### Q: What if I write my list and I only have weaknesses, no strengths?

That's a distortion born of low self-esteem or depression. If you exist, you have strengths—even if it's just "I've survived this long" or "I can breathe" or "I can feel." Start there. The list doesn't have to be grand. It just has to be honest. Conversely, if you list only strengths and no weaknesses, that's spiritual bypassing or inflated ego. Everyone has both. The point is accurate assessment, not self-punishment or self-aggrandizement.

### Q: The teaching mentions that in Libra we'll calibrate these waves. What does that mean?

In Virgo (now), you're identifying and organizing all the pieces. You're making lists, recognizing what's there. In Libra, you'll work with balance—adjusting the waves so they create harmony instead of discord. You'll learn to use your descents and ascents consciously, to modulate between strength and weakness purposefully. First you must see clearly what you're working with (Virgo). Then you can balance it (Libra). Don't skip ahead.

### Q: How does this relate to the chakras being a rainbow of frequencies?

Each chakra is a different frequency of the same light. Root is the slowest, most physical. Crown is the fastest, most spiritual. But they're all part of the same spectrum, the same wave. When one chakra is in the valley (weak), another might be on the mountain (strong). Your job is to recognize the whole landscape—where you're up, where you're down—and to move between them consciously. The rainbow shows you're experiencing multiple frequencies simultaneously, creating the complexity of being human.

**Note:** Tomorrow, Day 38, we move to the Knees to work with Advance—the wisdom of history encoded in our legs, the stepping forward and stepping backward. Rest well. The foundation is set. Now we learn to move.
