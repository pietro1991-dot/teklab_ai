## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. Welcome to our second day to the physical week of areas.

So I remind you that as soon as we are still , we are already in the energy of tourists , but we are following that lantern calendar.

So that 's why we are still finishing areas.

So first of all , happy Earth Day to all of you. We are humans and that means that we are part of Earth. And so a happy day to all of you and to our beautiful planet.

So another thing to say about today is 22nd , April 22nd.

So today we change our intention for everyday. Which means , remember that we are doing this activation of the Mercabat as a group.

So since February we started to do this intentions for everyday. The six intentions to create the Mercabat.

So we have done the wisdom yesterday we finished with love and today we begin with will.

## Q&A

So the task is simple during all this month until May 21st. Every time , every moment when we go to sleep at night , we just say to ourselves , I am and the attribute , which for today and the next third will be I am oil.

So let 's begin with the topic for today which is Transcendence and the task that we have been given for tonight. For today , sorry. Just something to tell to you. The task for today is not needed to be done today.

You can do it whenever you want whenever you please.

Okay.

So we are just sharing that today and because we are doing this path every day. But it 's not needed to do it now , you can do it whenever you feel.

So just for the people that we are asking a lot for the new ones that are joining us in these days , they were asking if there is , is it necessary to do all the previous videos before you start with this one? With this one 's where we are now and it 's not necessary right now because we are like kind of following and energy altogether.

So you can join us from now , that 's in matter. But of course I would recommend you to start by the first one in August and eventually you will catch up with the whole information. But it 's not necessary to see all the previous things so you can catch up with today.

So do n't worry. But as I said , I would recommend to take it because I speak about many things that I give for search in for for sure. I stopped that I already explained.

Okay.

Today I read a comment also that I want to clarify about this because for sure , a lot of people have been feeling in that way maybe , which is that the question was , why am I feeling so lost and without any clue of grounding doing the I am path? Like if I am losing everything that I was connected to , like I do n't have any clue of what to believe anymore and this kind of things.

Okay. This is something really normal. Welcome to the path of the I am. And why is this?

Because the path of the I am is to question yourself all the time about what you are and what you can become , which means that you have to transcend all the beliefs and all the things that you are bounded to by culture , by tradition , all the things that you felt that are safe for you. Because we are mammals and we are looking for comfort. We are looking to have something to grab and to hold on.

So we can be safe and secure and that 's why when we start to look into the basis of everything suddenly we do n't have a floor. We do n't have a ground to hold us.

So that 's why it 's so hard. It 's painful sometimes because actually it 's the process of detachment. It 's like a demo process of everything that we were connected to.

So that 's why we can feel this De situation , this weird feelings that makes us feel that this is not making me good. But you know , we have this belief that everything that is that I like is the things that are good. And for sure , for example , I love chocolate. But if I eat a lot of chocolate , it will be bad for me.

So not always what is sweet , what we like is really what is good for us.

So that 's why it 's much more bitter.

So for sure , when we are working in these kind of things in this path , we have to face the situations in which the body and the soul needs to re-signify all the concepts.

So the touch of the previous ideas of the concepts.

So that 's why both of them hurt.

So we have to work and keep going in order to for the body and the soul to recorder into the new reality we 're building for ourselves. I have gone through that to myself.

So I 'm just plain all this now because I did that path , of course , that was horrible for me.

So it 's natural. It 's all the concept of non-rever in a totally Latin sentence. And all these concepts , of course , takes us to transcendence. Though I spoke about transcendence , but today we 're going to concentrate much more in this concept.

So remember , here we have the word , trance is the other side , means the other side , and scandal means to climb , to go up. Transient is one of the four universal fondaments that we are going to see along this week.

So first of all , before we see the four of them , the universe is facing four fondaments. What is the fondament? Fundamental is the origin of the word is something that is on the base , way down on top of a hole. When we say profound , profound is what is there in the fondaments , something really low in the basement.

So basically it means that it means that from the base , anything that goes on the top of it , it will depend on that fondament.

## Practice Structure

So the image , of course , is the foundations of a building , for example , the foundations are like these main structures of a building. And then you can decorate the building , whatever you want all around and do all the things you want to the building , but the main structure of the building , the fondaments will be the structure of that holes in tire building.

So the universe has four columns that are the fondaments , the foundations of the entire existence.

So this fondaments of the universe will be the expression , expression , experimentation , integration , and transcendence.

So everything in the universe starts with expression.

So we have here x-pression , which means to get out from the pressure.

So it stands , it expands and it 's our universe from me and only one dot. That 's the expression. Then we have the experimentation. Experimentation is x , which is outside , ready , like the remember , that means around something and meant , which is the tool , something that is a tool.

So experimentation is the tools that you got , that you get around , the core of the universe , all around the core of the universe , of that that was expressed.

So basically the experimentation is the moment , the instance , in which the consciousness is using the tools that were expressed in the universe.

So after the experimentation , we reach integration. Integration means that all the things that were around in the were , all around the things , the all around the universe , calorically.

Now they start to have a net , they create a network. In means to get inside to be inside and take is segment , is the tissue that is created like network , like a net.

So all the things that were around in a chaotic shape now has an idea , a logic in a matrix , they all connect to each other.

So integration is the action of putting all the things that were around in a logical pattern. That 's integration. And the last one is transcendence. Transcendence is to go to the other side , going up into another level.

Why? Because once I integrated and I can see the entire pattern , is the moment when I realize why I express this , why and what I has been experimenting.

So now it all has a new logic.

So from that point of view , now I am able to do a transcendental action of what I did before.

So I do something better. And the transcendence takes me again. And it takes me again to the next level , which is to manifest , to express a new thing , to create a new reality , a new idea , and so on.

So why are they the fundamentals? Because we are doing these four things every second of our existence.

So these are the fundamentals of all the things because basically we do that every second. Like for example , breathing. This corresponds also with the process of breathing. This corresponds also with the process of eating the circulation of the blood with our daily life , we can not go into sleep.

All the process is constant. This is something that we do all the time in every second of our life. All the beings , whether they are organic or inorganic , they go through these cycles.

So important to know that this is not exactly like we start by this and then we start by that one and we follow this one and we the next one is that one is not a process like a line that it follows exactly a process like this.

Remember that each one of these words is kind of a fundamental , a column in a building. It 's not that each one of the columns are moving or built before the other ones.

So you will never have a building in that way.

So the four of them are together working.

So whenever I 'm expressing myself that three are also acting whenever I 'm experimenting , the other three are acting and so that happened with the other two.

So this is a constant process in which does n't matter in which one we are doing. The other three are moving at the same time.

So the only way why it is used useful to see them as a process is for our minds to understanding which process we find ourselves right now transforming our consciousness. That 's only thing.

So now with this here we can understand that these are the fondaments of the universe. Everything moves through here. And these are fondaments because they are useful to understand also time and space. We can understand for example expression as water experimentation as air integration as fire and transcendent as air.

So in the same way we can understand expression as spring experimentation as summer integration as autumn and transcendent as the winter.

So here we have the different moments of time and space. The stages of time and space. But today we concentrate specifically in transcendence. As we have said transcendence is related with going from one level to the next one.

So we can understand in this way that the process of transcendence is like the process of evolution we can understand it as the process of evolution.

So evolution is not something that takes you to move forward by leaving stuff behind by just getting rid of stuff. What you do in the process of evolution is to take the tools that you have , transforming them in tools for what you are facing in the future.

So this means that in order to reach transcendence we need integration. We can define this as the next. Transcendence is the jump that I do to the next level. Then what I leave in that level is what we call experimentation.

So once I did all experimentation what I now do is the integration of all things. And then once I do this in integration I transcend to the next level. And when I reach there I start to express all the things that I brought from here into the next level.

So that 's expression and all the things that I express here will be experimented again.

So as you see here , these things are happening at the same time. It 's not something that is separated.

So transcendence is basically what allows me to go from one level to another. But now , picture that this is a little person , the one that is transcendent to another level.

So that person when it goes to the next level , it does n't leave behind an arm or a head. It goes complete with all the body. It goes to the next level.

So what this is the means that everything that I expressed in each level , everything that I experimented in each level and everything that I had integrated in each level will come with me.

So now can I move forward without having integrated? Yes , we can move forward without having integrated. That 's what we call karma. One life after the other one.

One life after the next one. Why can we move forward if we had an integrated? Well , I would try to show it graphically. In the cinema , I have this person.

So now imagine that I have here , I am this little person with a backpack and I found a book and I put it in my backpack.

So now I go to the next level where there is another book and then I go up again and there is another book.

So now to picture this in this life , I go to book and instead of reading the book to have the knowledge to wisdom inside of me , I just say I will read it in the next one.

So in the next life , I will have two books. But if I do n't read any of those in the next one , I will have three books. And the backpack will be every life much more heavier.

So as I go up to the top of the mountain , the readiness will be stronger.

So it will be really difficult to reach the top of the mountain , because I am carrying a lot of weight.

So if I go like this during the whole process , the weight of the back will be so strong that it will start to hurt , the knees , the feet , the spine , everything and it will be so much weight that I can stand my life to many ways to carry.

So once if I do n't want to carry all this weight , what I have to do is just to sit down for a moment in one of those lives , I start to think about all the books and read all the books.

So I have the wisdom , the knowledge inside of me. And then I can leave all the books behind , but I carry with me the wisdom that is inside this books.

So the way we can explain how to read the books is what we are doing every day. With therapy , trying to understand our ancestors , trying to transcend our karma , trying to know the world in a different way , do all the therapies we can.

So those things that keep us looking in the past to heal our history is basically to read those books. To read the books is basically to become aware of the process that took me until here.

So the idea here of what is transcendence is basically to remember that the books are from the library that they do n't belong to you , that the books are not a weight that you have to carry. The books are public , are from everyone.

So you just have to read the book to understand what it means and then give it back to the library. That 's it. It 's not to forget the book and not think about the book anymore because I 'm free now. No , it 's about becoming aware , reading the book , understanding the content of the book and then give it back because you do n't have to take it.

It 's from the library.

So when I take the books for myself , I am taking away the possibility for others to understand that same story and for each person the book would be different with a different information because for sure it happened to you that a lot of people read the same book and take data that is very different from one to another. Everyone has a different understanding of the same topic.

So as you see transcendence is not about living behind , it 's about keep going by absorbing the knowledge within.

So it 's not a weight for me in the past.

## Q&A

So this that I explained here is related with a task that was for today , which was which is to walk the stairs , to take the stairs and to walk each step. As if it is every one of these experiences through your life.

So you can acknowledge that you are here in this moment because of all the steps that you gave. It 's not that you just forgot to forget all them. Is that you recognize all them but also you know that you are not that anymore. That many things have changed and you are different.

So you want to the path but you also release the weight of the path. But for that you have to acknowledge it. The task basically is to do one step for every year on a stairs.

So in the floor the first one is the first year of your life. And then when you take the first step up is the second year of your life. And then the other one , the third year and so on until you accomplish all of them. And what you will do in each one of the steps is to try to remember something what happened to you that your brain remembers from that year.

Which means it can be just a flavor , it can be a smell , it can be a color. It does n't have to be a memory specific memory we can as we can tell a story. Maybe your brain will show you when you start to do the task will show you eventually the images that you do n't even have to think about.

So when you go up on the stairs you do this exercise.

So if you have 60 years old and there is only five stairs , five steps on the stair in your home.

So you do that all the times you need.

So you go up and then when you finish the first five or six years you go back again and then you start with the next five always going up and go back and so on.

So it does n't matter if you can do it in the nature , you can do whatever just taking account of an idea that shows you stairs like rocks or trees or something that helps you to know how to measure one spot or the other.

So but you have to walk it , you have to do it. And in each one of them you just think about the the the bringing to the memory and the idea that happened in that year.

So once we reach the last step which is our age , actual age today which has turned back and we take a look into all the stairs that we have given and when you do that you just contemplate all this story , all the history of your own in only one piece and just contemplate , do n't do anything else , just honor and contemplate from the point acknowledging the point where you are now.

So this exercise is a simple way in which we help the body and soul acknowledge all the things that we had already transcluded , all the things that we have gone through that look where we arrived besides all the things that happened.

So when you do that exercise you can actually turn back and say now I understand why so I 'm ready to give the next step and to transcend these ideas of myself.

So today I was going up and down in the stairs and I guess that people were looking at , I do n't know but I do n't care , it 's like , surprises for myself.

So for those who can not move the legs or kind of walk you can use your hands and maybe touch the different parts of the body like doing steps in your own body. But those who can walk walk , go on the steps. Do n't be lazy. Let 's go to the information for today.

## Daily Practice Elements

The vibration for today is hard. The statement for today is I am the signer of my philosophy.
