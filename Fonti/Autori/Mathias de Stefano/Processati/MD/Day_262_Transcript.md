## Overview

Happy Earth Day to all. We are humans, which means we are part of Earth. Today we also change our daily intention for the Merkabah activation. After finishing love yesterday, we begin with will. From today until May 21st, every time you go to sleep at night, say to yourself: "I am will."

Today's topic is transcendence, one of the four universal fondaments. Before diving into this concept, an important clarification about the I Am path: feeling lost, groundless, and disconnected while doing this work is completely normal. This path requires questioning yourself constantly about what you are and what you can become, which means transcending all beliefs and things you're bounded to by culture and tradition.

We are mammals looking for comfort and security, something to grab and hold onto. When we start looking into the basis of everything, we suddenly don't have a floor, no ground to hold us. This is why it's so hard and sometimes painful. It's the process of detachment, the demolition of everything we were connected to.

Not always what is sweet and likable is good for us. When working on this path, the body and soul need to re-signify all concepts, to detach from previous ideas. Both processes hurt. We have to work and keep going for the body and soul to re-anchor into the new reality we're building for ourselves.

## Core Teaching

### The Four Universal Fondaments

Before understanding transcendence specifically, we need to grasp what fondaments are. The word "fondament" originates from something on the base, way down at the foundation. When we say "profound," we mean what is there in the fondaments, something really low in the basement.

Fondaments are the foundations of a building. From the base, anything that goes on top will depend on that fondament. You can decorate the building however you want, do all kinds of things to it, but the main structure, the fondaments, will be the structure of that entire building.

The universe has four columns that are the fondaments, the foundations of entire existence: expression, experimentation, integration, and transcendence.

### Expression: Getting Out from Pressure

Everything in the universe starts with expression. Expression (ex-pression) means to get out from the pressure. It expands. Our universe expanded from only one dot. That's expression.

### Experimentation: Tools Around the Core

After expression comes experimentation. Experimentation is "ex" (outside) plus "peri" (around something) plus "ment" (tool). Experimentation is the tools you get around the core of the universe, all around what was expressed.

Experimentation is the moment when consciousness is using the tools that were expressed in the universe.

### Integration: Creating the Network

After experimentation, we reach integration. Integration means all the things that were around the universe chaotically now start to have a network. "In" means to get inside, and "tec" is segment, the tissue created like a network.

All things that were around in chaotic shape now have an idea, a logic in a matrix. They all connect to each other. Integration is the action of putting all things that were around into a logical pattern.

### Transcendence: Going to the Next Level

The last fondament is transcendence. Transcendence (trans-scandere) means to go to the other side, going up into another level. Once I've integrated and can see the entire pattern, this is the moment when I realize why I expressed this, why and what I've been experimenting.

Now it all has new logic. From that point of view, I am able to do a transcendental action of what I did before. I do something better. Transcendence takes me again to the next level, which is to manifest, to express a new thing, to create a new reality, a new idea.

### Why These Are Fondaments

These are the fundamentals because we are doing these four things every second of our existence. Breathing corresponds with this process. Eating, blood circulation, our daily life, going to sleep—all processes are constant. This is something we do all the time, every second of our life.

All beings, whether organic or inorganic, go through these cycles. Important to know: this is not a linear process where we start with one, then move to the next. Each word is a fondament, a column in a building. You never build columns one before the other. The four of them work together.

Whenever I'm expressing myself, the other three are acting. Whenever I'm experimenting, the other three are acting. This is a constant process where regardless of which one we're doing, the other three are moving at the same time.

The only reason it's useful to see them as a process is for our minds to understand which process we find ourselves in right now while transforming our consciousness.

### Understanding the Fondaments Through Elements and Seasons

These fondaments help us understand time and space. We can understand expression as water, experimentation as air, integration as fire, and transcendence as earth.

In the same way, we can understand expression as spring, experimentation as summer, integration as autumn, and transcendence as winter. Here we have different moments of time and space, the stages of time and space.

### Transcendence and Evolution

Transcendence is related to going from one level to the next. We can understand it as the process of evolution. Evolution is not something that takes you forward by leaving stuff behind, by getting rid of things. What you do in evolution is take the tools you have and transform them into tools for what you're facing in the future.

In order to reach transcendence, we need integration. Transcendence is the jump to the next level. What we leave in that level is experimentation. Once we've done all experimentation, we do integration of all things. Then once we do integration, we transcend to the next level.

When we reach the next level, we start to express all the things we brought from the previous level. All things we express will be experimented again. These things happen at the same time; they're not separated.

### The Danger of Transcending Without Integration

Picture a little person transcending to another level. When it goes to the next level, it doesn't leave behind an arm or a head. It goes complete with all the body. Everything I expressed in each level, everything I experimented in each level, and everything I integrated in each level will come with me.

Can we move forward without having integrated? Yes, we can move forward without integrating. That's what we call karma. One life after the other, one life after the next.

### The Backpack Metaphor

Imagine you're a person with a backpack. You find a book and put it in your backpack. You go to the next level where there's another book, then go up again and there's another book.

In this life, you encounter a book. Instead of reading it to have the knowledge and wisdom inside you, you say "I will read it in the next life." So in the next life, you have two books. If you don't read either in the next life, you'll have three books. The backpack gets heavier each life.

As you go up the mountain, the heaviness becomes stronger. It becomes really difficult to reach the top because you're carrying so much weight. If you continue like this through the whole process, the weight becomes so strong it starts to hurt your knees, feet, spine, everything. It becomes so much weight you can't stand life with so many things to carry.

If you don't want to carry all this weight, you have to sit down for a moment in one of those lives and read all the books. Then you have the wisdom and knowledge inside you. You can leave the books behind, but you carry the wisdom within.

### Reading the Books: Integration Work

The way to read the books is what we're doing every day with therapy, trying to understand our ancestors, trying to transcend our karma, trying to know the world in a different way, doing all the therapies we can. Things that keep us looking in the past to heal our history is basically reading those books.

Reading the books is becoming aware of the process that took us until here. The idea of transcendence is to remember that books are from the library. They don't belong to you. Books are public, from everyone. You just have to read the book to understand what it means, then give it back to the library.

It's not about forgetting the book and not thinking about it anymore because you're free now. It's about becoming aware, reading the book, understanding the content, then giving it back because you don't have to take it. It's from the library.

When we take books for ourselves, we take away the possibility for others to understand that same story. For each person, the book will be different with different information. Many people read the same book and take away very different things. Everyone has a different understanding of the same topic.

Transcendence is not about leaving behind. It's about keeping going by absorbing the knowledge within, so it's not a weight from the past.

## Practice

### The Stairs Exercise

This exercise relates directly to today's teaching. Walk the stairs, taking each step as if it represents each experience through your life. Acknowledge that you are here in this moment because of all the steps you gave. You didn't forget them all. You recognize all of them, but you also know you are not that anymore. Many things have changed and you are different.

You walked the path, but you also release the weight of the path. To do that, you have to acknowledge it.

The task is to do one step for every year on a staircase. The floor is your first year of life. When you take the first step up, that's your second year. The next step is your third year, and so on until you accomplish all of them.

### How to Perform the Exercise

In each step, try to remember something that happened to you that your brain remembers from that year. It can be just a flavor, a smell, a color. It doesn't have to be a specific story memory. Maybe your brain will show you images you don't even have to think about.

If you're 60 years old and there are only five steps in your staircase, do it as many times as you need. Go up for the first five or six years, then go back again and start with the next five years, always going up. Go back and repeat. It doesn't matter if you do it in nature with rocks, trees, or anything that helps you measure one spot or another. But you have to walk it, you have to do it.

In each step, bring to memory an idea that happened in that year. Once you reach the last step, which is your actual age today, turn back and take a look into all the stairs you have given.

### Integration Moment

When you look back, contemplate all this story, all the history of your own in only one piece. Just contemplate. Don't do anything else. Just honor and contemplate from the point of acknowledging where you are now.

This exercise helps the body and soul acknowledge all the things we've already transcended, all things we've gone through. Look where we arrived despite all the things that happened.

When you do this exercise, you can turn back and say, "Now I understand why, so I'm ready to give the next step and to transcend these ideas of myself."

### Alternative for Those Who Cannot Walk

For those who cannot move their legs or walk, you can use your hands and touch different parts of your body, doing steps along your own body. But those who can walk should walk. Go on the steps. Don't be lazy.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Perform the stairs walking exercise. Find a staircase (or create one symbolically in nature with rocks, trees, or other markers). Walk one step for each year of your life, from birth to your current age. At each step, allow a memory, feeling, smell, color, or image from that year to arise naturally.

When you reach your current age, turn around and look back at all the steps you've climbed. Contemplate your entire history as one complete piece. Honor the journey. Acknowledge where you are now because of all these experiences.

This is not a one-time exercise. You can return to it whenever you feel the weight of your past or need to integrate new experiences.

### Applying This Teaching

Begin to view your life challenges not as burdens to carry forever but as books to read and return to the library. When painful memories or unresolved situations arise, ask yourself: "Have I read this book? Have I extracted its wisdom? Or am I just carrying it without learning from it?"

Remember that transcendence requires integration. Before trying to move past something, make sure you've truly understood it, absorbed its teachings, and released your attachment to it.

Notice when you're trying to transcend (move forward) without integrating (understanding). This creates the karma backpack. The heavier it gets, the more it will manifest as physical pain, emotional blocks, or repeated life patterns.

## Q&A

### Q: Why does the I Am path make me feel so lost and disconnected from everything I believed?

This is the path of questioning yourself constantly about what you are and what you can become. You must transcend all beliefs and things you're bound to by culture and tradition. As mammals, we seek comfort and security, something to hold onto. When we examine the basis of everything, we suddenly have no floor, no ground. This groundlessness is painful but necessary for real transformation.

### Q: What exactly are the four universal fondaments?

Expression (getting out from pressure), experimentation (using tools around the expressed core), integration (connecting everything into logical patterns), and transcendence (moving to the next level). These four fondaments work simultaneously in every moment of existence, like four columns holding up a building, not like a linear sequence.

### Q: How can I move forward in life if I haven't integrated everything from my past?

You can move forward without integration—this is what creates karma. You'll carry unintegrated experiences like books in a backpack, life after life. The backpack gets heavier, eventually manifesting as physical pain, emotional problems, and repeated patterns. The solution is to sit down in one of those lives (preferably this one) and "read the books"—do the integration work through therapy, self-reflection, and conscious healing.

### Q: What does it mean to "read the books" of our experience?

Reading the books means becoming aware of the processes that brought you to where you are now. It's therapy, understanding your ancestors, transcending karma, knowing the world differently, doing healing work. You extract the wisdom from each experience, embody that wisdom, then release the experience itself back to the universal library. The books don't belong to you; they're for everyone to learn from.

### Q: Isn't it better to just forget the past and move on?

No. Transcendence is not about forgetting or leaving behind. It's about integrating the wisdom and releasing the weight. If you try to forget without integrating, you'll carry that unread book into your next phase of life or your next lifetime. Real freedom comes from reading, understanding, integrating, then consciously releasing—not from denial or forced forgetting.

### Q: How do the four fondaments relate to time and elements?

Expression is water and spring. Experimentation is air and summer. Integration is fire and autumn. Transcendence is earth and winter. These correspondences help us understand that these fondaments are not just abstract concepts but fundamental patterns woven through all of existence.

### Q: What is the practical purpose of the stairs exercise?

The stairs exercise helps your body and soul acknowledge all the things you've already transcended and gone through. By physically walking one step for each year of your life, allowing memories to arise naturally, then turning to contemplate the entire journey, you integrate your history. This integration prepares you to transcend to your next level without carrying unnecessary weight.

### Q: Why must the exercise be physical rather than just mental?

Your body needs to experience the acknowledgment. Walking physically, moving through space, engaging muscles and breath—this creates real integration. The body stores memory and trauma. Only by involving the body can you truly release what needs to be released and integrate what needs to be integrated.
