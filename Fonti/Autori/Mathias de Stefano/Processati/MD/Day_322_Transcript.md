## Introduction

How are you? Good morning , good afternoon. Good evening. Happy Solstice to everyone.

I do n't really like to watch the camera here because it looks like I 'm speaking alone to a machine.

So when I look into your comments , I do n't feel that I am alone.

So I can share better.

So let 's begin with our topic for today.

So I remind you before we start that we are still in the physical week of Gemini. And this is because for the new people they are following , we are not following the normal calendar that we have. We followed the ancient Atlantic calendar , which is much more related to concepts of time than exactly the tropical or the central anthologies. For those who follow the tropical astrology today , we begin with cancer.

But we in our calendar , we have still one week more of Gemini. And for those who follow the central , we have another month to go until we reach cancer.

So whatever you use , this one is conceptual.

## Q&A

So just to wrap this idea before we finish because I saw a question here. There is no the best calendar or a wrong calendar , or which one is the real one. There is no a real way or a real or best way to see the stars. There are different and many different points of view of how you can see it.

So neither of them is the best one. It 's just different points of view of the same thing.

Okay , so you can check one of the videos that I guess it was in Aquarium , the month of Aquarium , that you can that you can check better their why and what is the tropical central , so you can learn more.

So someone maybe can help you know which video I spoke about it.

So name , the topic for today is name. I explained yesterday that we humans , we are different from animals because we use words. We communicate with words. Many animals use sounds to communicate.

But we structured a way of communication through sounds that we call words and that can transfer data information. Complex concepts of information. Of course , then we can understand that there are some animals that reach some really complex way of communication. That is much more than sounds like for some whales , some other how I mean it 's in in the in the earth.

They can use some kind of sounds specific sounds that can seem like words and transmit a lot of data and a lot of information in between the individuals. But we humans have accomplished to create hundreds of languages , very complex with culture , religion and many information that we can share to one another that made us clear where we are.

So in evolution humans have been gifted with the gift of the word to speak.

So that 's what we are.

So not only humans we use the concept of names , the concept the words made into concepts. Lay for example some mammals like some whales , dolphins and some homicide. They also have name for each other.

So they can recognize each other through names.

So we are not the only ones that use this kind of communication of conceptual communication. What we can say about this is that we are not the only intelligent beings that exist in a planet that can name to each other that can transmit information to one another. There are many of course , but the difference that we got is that we were able to create and to handle the reality through those words to transmit tools to transmit information and to make our dreams into reality.

So that 's mainly what separated us from other intelligent beings on new words and new in our ability to speak.

So we can understand that this ability to name to each other was something that evolution took us through a long time ago when some species acknowledge how to how to create their own tools to recognize the individual in between the herd.

So they could know , okay , I have all the tools inside to to to to to transcend to do something better to do to create something different.

So those things that were able to say I am just to recognize the individual in between the rest. We are intelligent beings that we 're able to build everything that we are.

So all the intelligent species that exist and that we 're able to name to oneself. Once that that can be divided from the animal kingdom and to be recognized as something beyond , as something much more intelligent.

So throughout the history when we involve you sounds to determine our environment , we were using sounds like. Ref for the be , we were using tack for a hit , though this kind of sounds. Where the ones used to determine all the objects that were around , so we can picture where we were or where we were. But suddenly the intelligence comes in the moment when we are able to determine who we are inside those objects.

I myself understand , mean myself , I understand that I am another object separate from the others that has a history , a feeling , a body , a thought , so that can determine a being , something that is much more abstract to understand.

So when I can name something that embodies all the previous conception , when I can embrace all that in one name , we become intelligent beings , we become someone is able to handle the reality , so because it understands something that is abstract , something that is beyond the reality.

So as many other mammals use this process , naming the beings , the self , but we started to use it in order to transcend and to make something different , make something transcendental to create cultures and technology and so on. The important thing to know here is that names are conjunction of vibrations , are conjunction of different resonance in a wavelength of frequency.

So I explained once about colors , why we see colors.

The reason why we see colors is because not because the things has a color , but because the things have a specific structure that when the light keeps those structures , it creates a frequency in the wave that if we , in our eyes , are able to capture , we can see the color.

So the colors we see in our reality are not because they are there , it 's basically because we can perceive them. If we can not perceive this wavelengths , we are not going to see the colors.

So it 's basically everything vibration and wavelength.

So reality is not real as we see it , it 's just real as we perceive it.

So the sounds that we perceive that we listen in our life affect us according to how we are sound with.

So this means that everything that is around us , that heat us , is constantly conditioning what we are. Everything that we listen , that we see , that we feel , is basically molding what we are , how we are in our daily life.

So this , this works like this , like the environment conditioning us all the time , because we leave our lives through unconscious and it 's not bad to be unconscious and aware , but if we are willing to become aware and conscious person , we have to acknowledge this , that if we live through consciousness , the environment will condition what we are. But if we become aware and we know how to handle our inside , so we will be the ones handling the outside and using the reality , not the other way around.

So this is not something , this is something from the very beginning , from the same , from the main cell , the first cell that existed in this planet , it 's been like that , the environment is conditioning us all the time. But a few people , a few beings , were able to transcend that and that 's why they seem not to be in this planet , like if they are living a parallel reality for sure.

So where does the name take a part on all this? Well , a name is basically one of the main vibrations that you can hear and that you listen in your life , and it 's the one that you hear the most. Is the one that your parents tell to you , is the one with which you recognize? Is the one that friends , family , partners , at school , at work , in society , all of them call you this name.

So people , when they say your name is like a vibration , molding everything that you are.

So it 's like holding the name , holds the entire package of your body , your soul and your spirit , your physical , your emotional and your mind. Just one name , then body is all what you are.

So when people tell their name , it molds vibrational what you are. The importance of the name is very , very huge because it 's not something that we just used to color ourselves. Is the main vibration that molds in essence when we are in all our self? Not only because other ones call us that name , but also because we ourselves introduce ourselves saying , I am , but yes , saying the name.

So when we say that name with the I am , we are recognizing that we are that vibration.

So it 's beyond what we believe is beyond the history , it 's beyond if we like it or not. It condition all the time. Every time that we say it.

So regarding the name , it is so important that we have to make these questions. What is my name from where it can from? Why name named me like that? What is the history behind this name?

Do I love name? I do n't like the name. Why I like it? Why I do n't like it?

Do I have any nickname? Do I feel much more comfortable with that nickname than with my name? Why? If I changed my name , why I would choose to change it?

How do I feel with that?

So all these kind of questions are the ones that we have to make ourselves because a name is basically the vibration that encodes the entire being that we are.

So it 's not just a simple thing. It 's like a whole package of concepts.

So one of the things that we have to do questioning ourselves is if I do n't like my name and I want to change it or I use another different name. The question is okay , you can change it. It 's not a problem. The thing is that in order to change it consciously , we have to pay attention to why I decided to change it.

Why I do n't like the other name? What are the things that I am hiding from myself that I deny of myself , that I do n't want to see from myself? Because when we do that , we are denying a part of oneself. It 's important to understand that every vibration , every that we have been using , has been molding us since the very beginning.

So they have condition where we are.

So if I want to change into something new different and I want to change my name , the way that you can do it consciously is if you recognize why you want to change the name. What is the package of information that is hidden that you do n't want to see?

So you can form consciously and not to carry some data that you do n't want. We also have virtual names of course from other levels. Me myself , I remember my name in other levels , which is gone. But I would recommend not to use those names here because the name that you are called now is the name that is the package of information that you need for this incarnation now for a tool that you need to solve right now.

So in this incarnation , I am Matthias Gustavo Estefan , not Gain.

So if I make people call me Gain , my energy will totally different and I would n't have the opportunity to really do my work here as Matthias. Also some of the things that used to happen is that we commonly deny our names when we present our introduced to the world.

So I see that some people in the social media , they write a different name like I do n't know. A beautiful star or green earth or this kind of names. Which is perfect. It 's not nothing to judge about it.

But when you put those names , the question here would be , are you saying that name because you want to bring that into the world or business here and ask yourself , are you doing those names because you want to hide what you are?

So the question here is very important because we have to acknowledge to recognize if we are really doing this because we want to manifest that in ourselves or because we are trying to hide something that we do n't like. Like for example , the person called beautiful star , maybe her name is Colors , Colors means Spanшmins , Span , a pain.

So something that hurts.

So maybe you do n't want to be called Colors because it 's painful.

So you say , I want to be a shining star. But the question would be , what are the things that you are not healing of those pains? Why you are not facing those pains? Why do you want to be something different?

From where are we willing to be called different?

So there 's no judgment in what I 'm trying to say here. Well , I 'm just trying to encourage you is to question yourself why we call us as we are. If we use a nickname or we just make aberration of our words just just a letter and a dot or why we use a nickname instead of the first one. I do n't know , any , anything that you could think about of how are you called and how do you want to be called?

Are telling you about many things of how you leave your life , of how you are presented in your life?

So this , the hard work to do to investigate about the etymology of the word and so on. Also besides the name , which is how we call ourselves or nicknames , we also have the surname. The surnames are the ones that brings the information from the entire group.

So from hurt , I hold a whole family or plan. The surname has the information from way before from all people in our history. What we have to look for is the meaning of the surnames to understand what I inherited from my family , from all of them , from where you come from the heraldic of this , the meaning of the surname can help us to understand what are we doing as a group. And the important thing is how are you called not if it is the mother name or the father name , is how you recognize yourself , which names you recognize as your own.

That 's the important thing.

So sometimes when we start to investigate about our family name , we discover surnames that we 're behind the arms and we start to find out names of our family tree that can surprise us and from where we come from and all the history behind these people. And suddenly we can figure out many things that can help us to understand our trauma , our conflicts today.

So sometimes the solution to understand some of these conflicts are written in our names and surnames and it was so close to us that we 'll see it.

So also you have to see the surnames of adoption like why have been adopted and what are the surnames of the people that adopted and so on. Like I do n't know in English but I do n't know any surnames in English like this but in Spanish we have a name that is a posits that is a name used for the people that were abandoned and they were like just garbage people. It 's kind of like this so they were called posits. In the English side of course we have many people that were that has names that were about escaping or being people that were slaves like for example in the states we have a lot of people named like son of someone which was the owner of them like Johnson Wilson and all these kind of surnames that are marking that they were owned by someone okay so that 's why most of the black people in the states has names ended in son for example or or some other names like Freeman because they were names used to say that they were free now okay so there are many many other concepts of names that can tell you about the history the hidden history of of yourself who you are.

So my the task for today for everyone is to start looking for your name the etymology of the name the origin of the name why have you been calling this the surnames and the history behind it so trying to look about all that information that is in your name because it contains all the data that have shaped you that have shaped who you are.

So I would recommend I would n't recommend any website or see if you do n't have to eat to for you to look for for a name because when you start to learn that in the internet there are so many and some of them are very soft like when you ask for a name they say that first is very wise or novel and it 's not like this so you have to look much more and do n't do n't keep the same thing that the first thing that appears to you just pay much more attention and look further okay do n't do n't do n't keep with only one vision of the name.

## Daily Practice Elements

So just a simple thing that sometimes could happen that most of the people in the Americas that has kind of the same name if you see along the Americas you will see a lot of people with the same surname is not because their families had that serving but it was because maybe they were slaves or worked for some feudal some landlord that had them okay so in the time that we had to use surnames for the first time America they used the names of their owner okay so that 's why we have so many people in the Americas without real surname but a surname that took from others okay or someone gave the surname to them so in point of view some people from the Americas maybe we would say oh I come from the Hernandez family from Spain or the Smith family from England and it 's not so just for you to to know to look beyond because in the Americas people did n't have serving basically so that 's why it was lost. Let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is high. The statement for today is I am a product of correspondence.

The code today is triumph frustration. I aligned to the knees and the meaning of the history we have gone through by generations in the center of the legs the energies of the vibration that unified the achievements of evolution accumulates and its science and close-ines speak of the positive emotion of triumph being the one that makes us feel that we have achieved everything necessary and expected in history and on the other side the negative emotion of frustration that reminds us that we have in a complex what we expected in our development process. I take you the breath. And become aware of my entire body starting from the feet towards the head.

And I am do so. My moving softly my toes. My angles my angles heath singer at the feet curve. And the jaw.

I start to stretch the body very softly and slowly. As if I am dancing in a very slow dance. I recognize the dis-entire body is formed by thousands , millions of cells and each one of them answers to only one name. With my two hands , I start to go throughout all my body.

Make you each part of it remember who I am from my head till my feet. I start to carry telling I am from my name to my eyes to my ears now. Each part I recognize myself. For my body corresponds to my name , my name corresponds to my body.

I correspond to the vibration that rebounds in my life. You just saw it. Just saw it. Not the English tongue is different.

My breath and recognize. Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it.

Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it.

Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it.

Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it.

Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it. Just saw it.

Just saw it. Just saw it. I recognize the name that I have pronounced in my body. It is the one that represents who I am in this time and space here and now.

I recognize that this name , the one that 's shaped the person that I am. I recognize it. I must recognize it. I must recognize my name softly.

I try to feel how it tastes. I pronounce my name in all the ways that I can remember. I try to feel what it makes me feel. I must recognize it.

I must recognize it. I must recognize it. I recognize how this name is for me. It corresponds to me for when I say it.

It brings memories and oceans. This is how I recognize that I am a product of this correspondence. I manifested here. I must recognize it.

I must recognize it. I must recognize it. I must recognize it. I am a product of correspondence.

I am a product of correspondence. I think I think. I take a deep breath. I recognize the name that I am.

I come back here and now stretching , young , open and slowly our eyes. I want to thank you for being here. I hope you enjoyed this video.
