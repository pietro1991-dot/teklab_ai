## Overview

Today is the toroid chakra of Pisces—the last day of the month of Pisces. Tomorrow we begin with the month of Aries.

The topic for today is **dream**.

Matias is visibly tired after 15 days running up and down through pyramids and temples since early in the morning. This physical and emotional state of tiredness has been a key to understand today in the pyramid why the topic is dream.

The concept of dream will be spoken through **three different aspects**, which show the three main parts of the toroid:
1. **Spiritual level** - going up
2. **Physical level** - going down  
3. **Soul level** - in the center

## The Physical Dream: Sleeping

### Why We Need to Sleep

When we live our daily life, we are wasting a lot of energy. We use too much energy all the day, all the time.

Why? Because when we are awake, when we are living our daily life, we are living through our **five senses**. The five senses are constantly trying to reach information, to take data from the entire environment where we are moving through, in order to survive in that environment, to know where we are, to have an idea of the space we are moving through.

Because of this, the body needs a lot of energy. The cells work so much trying to reach that information, to be aware of everything that is happening, that there is a moment that the body needs to rest in order to help the cells to regenerate, to transform, and to keep going.

**That's the moment of sleeping.**

---

## The Universal Wave

Everything in the universe moves through waves—positive, negative, positive, negative, like a spiral moving up and down.

Why? Because if energy moves in a straight line, it has force at the beginning but then loses energy until it stops. But when something has the push to the positive and then goes down into the negative, it suddenly has strength to move again, like a pulse.

**We need the negative in order to keep moving faster.** That's why light and particles move in spirals.

Time and space are the two constants. Between them, positive and negative create third dimensional beings living between the polarity. This constant movement of energy explains why we have to die and be born again, why we have periods of consciousness and unconsciousness.

---

## The Natural Cycles of Consciousness

The question: why did Atlantean civilization, if it was so aware and had so much evolution, fall down? And what about us, if we are now rising up in consciousness again, will the same happen to us?

**The answer is: this is natural.** It isn't about doing it right or wrong. It's about the cycles. Sometimes you wake up, sometimes you go to sleep. It's natural. Sometimes you are aware, sometimes you are unconscious.

This is like a plant raising up, then falling. Atlanteans, falling. Egyptians, falling. Roman Empire, falling. And now, rising again. This is constant. This is natural. **This is not about right or wrong. This is natural.**

Our goal is not to be constantly up there in the consciousness. **Our goal is to learn how to sleep properly and not to have a nightmare.** Our goal is to flow with the process, not to be stuck in one idea.

The reason why empires have fallen is because they don't respect the time of going to sleep. If we know how to go to sleep, there's no need for suffering or nightmare.

The reason why we suffer the negativity going down is because we are still attached to the positive, trying to live like that constantly, living in the past. But if we allow ourselves to rest, we will enjoy this part. **Not to sleep well is basically to be attached to the past.**

---

## Nature Works in Cycles

Being positive doesn't mean good—it means we're attached to permanence. If I like summer, many parts of the planet can't stand being summer all the time. The plants need to rest. Autumn, winter are the key for many beings and plants to survive another summer.

**We need the process of going to sleep in order to wake up.** Nature works by cycles. This is why sleep is so important—when we go down to sleep, we take the energy to go up, to wake up. If we don't go to sleep, we never wake up. If we are constantly waking up, we don't have time to regenerate our bodies.

---

## The Brain Organizing Data

The cells use their energy all day to understand everything around. They reach a point where the body says, "I can't do this anymore. I need to regenerate." That's why the brain shuts down the system so we go to sleep and cells can work to regenerate.

**The brain is not an exception.** It stores data throughout the entire day—even data we're not aware of. When we sleep, the five senses shut down, but the brain is exchanging data between neurons, organizing all the information into different layers, different folders. The neurons create electrical pulses that share this data while we're sleeping.

**That's what we call dreams**—a parallel reality within. The brain is still working even if the senses are shut down, so we can live the reality that the brain is perceiving.

---

## Dreams: The Brain's Interpretation

Remember that the senses work by capturing electrical pulses that are translated by the brain to understand the environment. Actually, nothing is real outside—it's only the interpretation of your brain.

If the brain is the only one that perceives reality, and the brain is still working while we sleep, then we can live that reality that the brain is feeling. **That's the dream.**

The reason why dreams are so weird is because the brain is not aware of what's happening outside. It's just exchanging data for the future. The neurons are doing the connections, exchanging information. That's why we might be cleaning the house with an elephant—the brain is organizing the data we saw or thought about that day.

---

## The Emotional Dream: The Soul

Once the brain has organized information, it shares it with the **glands**. The glands tell the rest of the body what data is needed. This awakens **the dream of the soul**—when **emotion** comes in. The hormones that produce emotions start to determine the dreams we have, shaping the idea of the dreams.

All data stored in the subconscious and unconscious is shown in the brain—information from every cell. That's why when we sleep, dreams can tell us about emotions in our unconscious, information from many lives, family connections in the emotional way, the energy body from many dimensions. The soul shows us information we have within many different layers.

It's not that the soul leaves the body—the realities in other dimensions are all connected. It's when the brain organizes information and shares it with the hormones.

---

## Dreams of the Future and Beyond

During our days, we're aware of less than 10% of all information our brain receives. The brain at night tries to organize all that data, creating **calculations of probabilities** for what could happen. That's when you have **premonition dreams**—different timelines and spaces organizing in your brain.

In this process, we can expand ourselves, remembering we're connected in a network. We can download information from the environment, not just from ourselves. This is when we may feel an invasion of information, and the body protects itself—that's **sleep paralysis**.

When we realize we're dreaming and can control the information inside, that's **lucid dreaming**. We can practice this by thinking about what we want to work on before sleep—the brain will show us that information.

**Astral projection** is managing to go to sleep without sleeping, being aware of the senses but not letting the brain sleep. Your brain can then access other dimensional realities of the soul.

---

## The Spiritual Dream: Manifesting Dreams

### Intelligence: Reading Between the Lines

The brain is a constant machine of organizing data.

When all this data is being organized, it creates synapses of information that we call **intelligence**.

Intelligence comes from the word:
- **Inter** = between
- **Legere** = to read

**To read in between lines**—that's the meaning of intelligent.

### Showing Different Options

The brain, through dreaming, gives us tools to see the reality in a very different way from which we see it in our daily life. It shows us different options that we couldn't see when we were awakened.

The dreams show us ways in which we can bring the ideas from our head to the outside and **manifest our dreams**.

### I Have a Dream

The spiritual level of dream is when we can interpret the dream, making it into an idea and projecting it to the outside, making it happen, making our dreams true.

The spiritual aspect of the dreaming is the one that says, **"I have a dream."**

It's the one that says: inside of me, I have an idea. I have something inside, a clear idea of what I expect it to be. And I am willing to manifest it outside.

## Dreams Changed History

### Making Decisions

This is why, for good or for bad, a lot of people in history have changed the history because of a dream.

They spoke with the pillow to take a decision. The information from the outside is so much that you have no idea how to organize it. So you go to sleep so your brain can show you different ways.

### The Importance of Dreaming

The importance of this kind of dreaming is basically because **without it we wouldn't be here**.

The reason why we exist, we are humans, is because of the dream.

### Manifest Our Dreams

We became different from other animals in this planet because we had the ability to **manifest our dreams**—the dreams that we have within. We started to manifest it outside.

That made us create:
- Cultures
- Civilizations
- Religions
- Arts
- Science
- Technology

All the things that we have today that we are was because of the intelligence of the brain creating dreams.

---

## We Live in a Dream

### Interpretation of the Outer World

The dream is the result of the interpretation of the outer world by our brain.

This is why a dream can also transform the outer world.

### The Message of Pisces

The last message from Pisces to close this day, this month of Pisces, is that basically **we live in a dream**.

Everything is a dream because we interpret the world through our brain.

Everything is a dream and we are the dreamer, and we project the future because of our dreams.

### Learning to Dream

This is why the message for this entire month, in order to integrate:
- All the senses of empathy
- All the emotions that make us be who we are
- The multidimensionality that we have within

**We need to learn how to dream.**

We have to stop being the dream of others and become the dreamer of our own reality.

**We have to learn how to dream being awakened.**

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortable. Close your eyes and concentrate in the breathing. Breathe deeply.

Start to massage your body from your feet to your head. Acknowledge each part of it.

Begin by your feet and legs. Follow by the genitals, hips and waist, by the back, chest, hands, arms and shoulders. Connect with your face and head.

### Releasing Tension

Take a deep breath, setting pressure in your body. Hold the breath and let it go, relaxing.

### Yawning

Start to yawn as much as possible, all you can. Feel with each yawn the energy moving around. Which parts relax? Which part is discharged of energy when you do it?

Feel how your body relaxes when you yawn.

### Remembering Your Dreams

I become aware of the dreams that I used to dream. I bring them with my imagination.

When I perceive these dreams that repeat themselves once again in my life, I recognize that they are showing me something that must have order within me.

What do I feel when I remember them?

### Your Dream for Your Life

Take a deep breath and try to think about: **what is your dream for your life?**

What is the dream that you want to make true? Imagine it becoming real.

### I Am a Manifest Dream

I become aware that I am a dreamer, that I can manifest my dream, for **I am a manifest dream**.

I become aware of my physical and emotional and spiritual dreams. I have them in this toroid around, setting the intention to manifest them.

**Th. Th. Th.**

**I am the eternal manifestation.**

**I am the dream and the dreamer.**

**I am the manifested dream.**

### Closing

Take your breath and start to bring all the consciousness through your body, stretching and warming.

Each one at some time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Honoring Sleep

Tonight, as you go to sleep, acknowledge: "My brain is about to organize the day's information. My body is about to regenerate. This is sacred work."

### Dream Journaling

Keep a journal by your bed. Upon waking, immediately write what you remember from dreams. Over time, you'll see patterns, messages, probabilities.

### Setting Dream Intentions

Before sleep, clearly state what you want your brain to work on: "Tonight I want to understand ___" or "Show me possibilities for ___."

### Lucid Dreaming Practice

Throughout the day, ask yourself: "Am I dreaming right now?" This habit will carry into sleep, helping you recognize when you're dreaming.

### Manifesting Your Dreams

What is your **spiritual dream**—the vision you have for your life?

Write it down. Speak it. Make it real. Remember: we became human by learning to manifest our inner dreams outside.

## Closing Pisces

We have completed the month of Pisces—the sign of unity, dissolution of boundaries, empathy, multidimensionality, and dreams.

Pisces taught us:
- To feel with all our senses
- To connect with all dimensions
- To remember we are one ocean
- To dream consciously

Tomorrow we enter Aries—the fire of will, action, and manifestation. We will take all we've learned in these eight months of soul and spirit work, and we will manifest it in the physical world for the next four months.

Thank you for walking this path with us through Pisces.

**See you tomorrow at the same time to begin the month of Aries.**

## Q&A

### Q: How do I remember my dreams better?

Keep a journal by your bed. The moment you wake, before moving, write anything you remember. Over time, your brain learns this is important and will retain more dream memory.

### Q: Are all dreams meaningful?

Yes and no. Some dreams are just data organization (the elephant in the house). But even those can show you what your brain is trying to process. Pay attention to recurring themes or strong emotions.

### Q: How do I have lucid dreams?

Practice reality checks during the day ("Am I dreaming?"). Set intention before sleep. When you realize you're dreaming, stay calm—excitement can wake you. Start small (moving a hand in a dream, changing a color).

### Q: Is astral projection safe?

Yes, but it requires practice and grounding. Your body naturally protects you (sleep paralysis). Start with lucid dreaming before attempting full astral projection.

### Q: Why do civilizations have to fall? Can't we break the cycle?

The cycle of up and down is natural, not bad. The teaching is to learn how to "sleep properly"—meaning, to rest, renew, and rise again without suffering. We don't break the cycle; we flow with it consciously.

### Q: What if my dream for my life feels impossible?

Remember: birds learned to fly because thousands of beings across millions of years kept trying. Your dream might not manifest in this lifetime of your personality, but your essence is eternal. Keep dreaming. Keep manifesting. It's a matter of time.

### Q: How do I "dream while awakened"?

Stay conscious while living—don't go through life on autopilot. Recognize that your brain is interpreting reality right now. You are dreaming this moment. What do you choose to dream into being?
