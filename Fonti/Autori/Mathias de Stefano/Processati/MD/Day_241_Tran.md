## Introduction

Hello everybody good morning good afternoon good evening so as you see I already slept so we finished with the month of the beautiful dream of Pisces and we begin with this park of areas with much more energy and impulse first let's begin with the idea as always of the introduction of what is the month of Aries and why it begins today and not one week ago or two I don't know when it was supposed to start astrologically so for all those who are new in these meetings I would like to remind you that we are not following the month according to the Gregorian calendar neither the the astrological calendar okay we are following the Atlantic calendar what is this remember the Gregorian calendar has 30 31 28 days they change every time we are not following that we are not following also the astrological that starts each sign around the 20 of each month so astrologically we are not following that neither We are following the Atlanta calendar that is 12 months of 30 days each related to with the plus five days out of time related to the concept of the month which are the zodiac signs but just the concepts of them not the astrological remember also that we have each month divided in three weeks of 10 days each first week for the mental second for the emotional and the third one for the physical the 10 days are related to the chakras so each day we go through a chakra Beginning by the crown chakra until the feet going also through the knees and the ankles so nine chakras nine days and the last one the tenth is the Taurus that close the entire week and remember that each day we are talking about a different topic and and this these topics are related to the information that I received that day so I have no idea what I'm going to speak about tomorrow remember that we have some information for every days and mantras some sounds that we are going to use for each for each day but the topic of the day I have no idea what I'm going to write about and speak about every day so that's why in the video you don't have the information of what we are going to speak about for sure when this path ends we will have we will add some hashtags or some notes about what what are the topics of each day in the videos but I really don't know right now no idea remember that all information for this path all the questions that you have about why we are doing this path what it is about how can I follow it everything are all in the blog so remember all of it is in the blog which is three W dot yosoi which is I am in Spanish and Dot red like the color but red means Network in Spanish so also remember this morning we have changed the music in the blog and for the alignments for the next 30 days we will have this new song that will help us in the alignment so thank you and all the team that made this song for this month remember that this music has the goal of activating the spark of eye areas in each one of our chakras so I hope you enjoy it foreign just remember that today we begin the last of the three Cycles of the path of the of I am so remember that also we are beginning the last cycle of three so these three are the body the soul and the spirit okay Body and Soul and Spirit remember that we have the signs in each one of the hours of this clock that we have here so the first one the fifth was Leo then Virgo then Libra then Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius and Pisces this is the path that we have taken until now so we have gone through the process of the Soul already from the beginning of this path we went through the process of the spirit from Sagittarius steel Pisces and now we are beginning the path of the body beginning through areas then Taurus Gemini and cancer remember that the reason why we don't end in this period but we end in the body is because we are connecting we are we are trying to connect the soul and the spirit as one to live in the body we are trying to manifest the heaven on Earth we are not doing the this path to rise and Ascend as a Spiritual Beings in another dimension we are doing this in order to live fully as a soul and a spirit here and now in our body so welcome today to the first day of the fourth month of the body so we begin the month of Aries so let's remember the trinity to which this sign belongs so this is the Trinity of Fire remember so that in this Trinity of the fire Aries is the spark that ignites the fire then Leo is the fire itself and then Sagittarius is the hit and the light that comes from the fire so now also remember that the that Aries represents the internal ego Leo represents the external ego and Sagittarius represents the expanded ego so remember that the internal ego is the one that refers to itself the one that says I am okay this is me I am so that's why the mantra for this month will be I am foreign month we have the I can I know I use and so on Aries is the one that will represent exactly I am because it's the one that refers to itself Leo is the external ego and that means that it needs from others in order to it needs from others in order to recognize the position that it has where it's located and the expanded ego of Sagittarius means that it doesn't need to refer to itself it doesn't need to it doesn't need others to refer it just moves around and start to find to expand and connect with everybody in every moment every space it doesn't matter so I hope we get this so this is how we can understand where we are located referring to areas this month so another interesting thing that is important to know about this is the process that takes this ego from the internal towards the external and then the expanded this one says I am in me this one here says I am in others and this one says I am in a breathing so this path has something interesting which is a spark ignites the fire sits on and then the Heat and the light expands so what happens now if we try to do it otherwise backwards like it's possible to make the Heat and the light to come back to the fire and the fire to come back inside the spark we can only do this through Concepts but we cannot do this physically so now what this means that in a reality like ours in the third dimension that we are hold by the constants of time and space to do this in a backwards it's almost impossible so now imagine this like if there is a fire in and people around in a circle okay so you are enjoying like in a camp so the heat of the fire goes around beyond the people so for the Heat and the light the freedom is all they know it's it's it's perfect but to go back into the fire and to be compressed again being watched by the people in the circle it's a heaviness this is a pressure for someone that already knew the expansion okay so it's really difficult this the same thing happened for the Leo Leo is the fire so for the fire to come back to the spark is oppressing it's like going back to this to this tiniest Park and it cannot be seen it cannot be shiny it's it's difficult impossible so in this sense Leo is like a limitations for Sagittarius and Aries is like a limitation for Leo so in this sense we can tell that like a Sagittarius would say I'm free now I I don't need the the to the the ego and when when someone when a Sagittarius mind sees a Leo it's like poor thing he still needs to be contained in the center by others he doesn't know what it is to be free yet so the same thing happens for Leo watching Aries Leo watching Aries is like Leo says to the areas is like a kid you never know when it's going to happen because it doesn't matter they don't follow the rules they just do whatever they want they can set the sparse everywhere and you never know how to control it so from the point of view of this Trinity of the fire we can we can kind of understand that the someone from Leo transcended Aries and someone from Sagittarius Transcendent Leo in this context is how we can understand now the concepts of Aries so important thing to know before we start with all this month I am here speaking about the concept of Aries I am not explaining the people that were born in Aries is nothing related to the personality is related to the concepts and attributes of the constellation okay great this is an archetype and with this I will mention something funny I'm a Leo for sure you know I I'm I'm a Leo so and I I need to be a Leo because otherwise I wouldn't be able to be here speaking with all of you and and showing me in this way and being the center of attention some some people told me like you have a lot of ego because you're showing yourself and blah blah and and yes of course and I don't have any problem with hiding that because it's my tool to have the ego of a Leo is is the thing that I need in order to do what I do otherwise I I wouldn't be able to do this so I I'm not I don't have any problem with the ego of Leo so so for me it's okay so I used the the the ego of Leo because my ego is external it shows the external aspect of the video if I don't show myself so I wouldn't be able to do my job what I what I do sometimes in our cultures we think that the ego is like an evil thing that we have to fight against and and and hide okay from from the world and that's the problem of why we don't have a proper ego as a tool because we we need to work with the ego because we have been hiding it so when you don't have a problem of saying I'm using my ego so it it gets easier to be work with because you can see it better so the ego of the of the Leo is towards the outside so we are trying always to be seen by by the others and to have a reflection on on the others so we can know if we are working properly with the ego or not so that that gives us the idea of controlling the others in in with this tool like we are trying to to refer ourselves into others so Aries works the internal ego and this means that Aries is watching itself the thing that bothers the Leo people regarding the Aries and talking about the archetype the the Leo concept when it sees the the areas is that the Aries doesn't care about the position of the others it doesn't care if air is is sleepy it goes to sleep it doesn't matter anything there's no responsibility on the outside because it's always looking into the inside by itself so this is my path this is what I have to do I don't care about the rest so it's kind of like that energy that the Leo people sees or the Leo concept sees in Aries so also something that happens is when Leo says Leo tries to find a very political way to be understood by everyone so it tries to find consents in everyone much more political and Aries doesn't have that Aries is like I don't care and if I don't like what you said I will just fight and that's it that's why Aries is related to the war to the conflict to the soldier that goes from the fight just not thinking about other things so something something funny that happened is that when I was writing in the post about Aries when I write when I say I and I I there's a conversation between I and am so I explains from my point of view my personality that oh this is like that or this is how I see the things and this is my question blah blah blah so that was my my point of view so I was explaining how I was looking into the areas that was conflicted for me okay and then the am explains me but you have to see the other side is the beginning is the spark is the one that makes the question to create everything that you are and blah blah so it explains me the good parts of Aries so I can understand it and the funny thing was that in the comments a lot of people that wear Aries were mad at me because you where you were judging the areas and and you were you were judging the areas and that's your projection of the ego in the areas and blah blah and they started to fight against my idea of of Aries and the the people from Aries were trying to to defend the idea of Aries being the best ones and blah blah and suddenly they end up giving me the reason because sorry I'm laughing I'm laughing from the Leo point of view but but it was so funny because because the people started to fight and that's a reaction of Aries actually like instead of reading the other option that I wrote about the important thing of the Aries they just saw the projection of the of my ego in in the areas so it was really funny because actually was the goal to see how Aries react no matter what like immediately he's fighting against something so so they could position their their spot so thank you but the thing that we have to understand from Aries is that Aries is the spark is the main spark that creates the light in the universe and a spark can ignites creating light or can create a fire that burns everything into ashes so we have to understand areas as the spot that initiates everything the one that creates the universe is the Divine spark the Divine spark that ignites everything in the universe that is like the kit that is willing to go and understand air all the universe and tries to tries to to understand the the creation to to to play with the creation the strength of areas to initiate things is the one that represents the initiatic paths in order to learn something so Aries is like this kid trying to find the limits of the universe so that's why is the one that questioned the one that look for the adventure to see the limitations of the of the world and is the one that when it sees a limitation tries to break it to see if it is really the end or there is something more behind so it's the will of keep going and that's why also it comes to break the limits is the one that fights that goes against and that's the origin of this conflictive image of the areas so remember also when I speak about the attributes of Aries don't relate when I say areas we don't relate with your sign with your sun sign okay because it's not related with when you were born okay so the people the people that has the sun in areas used to say but but you are seeing Aries is like this fighting and so on and I'm not like that I'm in service to others and remember it's not like this because everyone has many signs and many planets and different things so we don't live according to our son we live according to where our planets are yes so for example a person that has Aries in the Sun but in but has Mars in in Pisces or cancer will be a person with a lot of energy to serve others to be there to help people and it's nothing related to the soul to this to the sun sign okay the people that has a different rising sign usually after 29 years old you start to live more by the Rising Sun so you are not really from your side anymore so we have to understand that it's not about when you were born it's about many other things in the soul in the astral chart that you have to know so remember I am speaking about the archetype remember that when I speak about Aries as many others signs and speaking about the archetype or the concept and this means that I'm not speaking about the personality because the personality is not Aries the personality of someone is made up with many other signs according to the planets where are where they are so the personality is not only one sign is the combination of all of them okay so that's why I say I'm speaking about the concept or the archetype of Aries okay so don't feel discriminated or or criticized I'm speaking about an archetype so also we are beginning the mental week of of Aries which means that we are not going to speak about the normal attributes that we usually know from Aries we are gonna talk about the mental the Mind concepts of areas and this is the questions the Mind week of Aries is related to the question because the question is the one that initiates everything and of course that maybe you could say but the ones that question things all the time is Gemini and Sagittarius but they are questioning things in order to learn things in order to know things to achieve information Aries is not looking for information Aries is just questioning things so Aries is that kid that doesn't care about the answer but it cares about the question is the one that says why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why why all the time until the other one just explodes so here is this is curious to question just by the idea of questioning not because it wants to have the knowledge that is behind the question the energy of Aries is the one that question things just because it must be questioned to open doors to open different options so it's looking always to make a new question because the main goal is to open new adventures so the idea of the questioning from the point of view of Aries is not to have the answer is not to have the information after it's just to keep moving to keep creating things so when Aries asks something to someone won't stay for the answer one keep reading the entire book that's the question and when the other one is answering he left already to make the question to another one so and here comes the most important thing to understand the question is the origin of all things because there's no answer with our question and we need to take a path to discover and create the reality so the question is the one that pushes to create the path to find the answer and creates a path to find the answer inside the question you can find all the possibilities of the answer and the question by excellence is what what today I spoke I explained that what comes from the European language and is the same origin of Spanish Que this is because originates what that gives what what and in Latin we have core that is the origin of this Que so cool means question and the meaning of quo is object is an object object is an quo refers to the object and then comes the question for example imagine that quo means this so this how this when this who this what for so it's a concept that means an object so whoo is an object it's a it's a thing So when you say what is like speaking about the concept for every question so every question that you have is talking about the object that you are trying to picture so every question is asking about a specific term topic and what is the idea of of that this is the origin of the word question or question okay so a question means the the topic of this object so today the am was saying that in order to begin this initiative path we have to start questioning what what to everything because what is describing the things of what we are made of okay yeah so today the arm was saying you have to make the questions of what to every one of your chakras to go through all of the body and questioning everything to know what is that you are now what I believe what am I thinking what I see what I hear what I say what I shut up what I feel what am I what I create what I have what I do what I know what I looking for so the task for this week is to take a notebook and write down all these questions we begin today with the crown chakra we route that we write down what and down there we start to question everything what this what that what this what that what this what that only the questions with what and there's no need to answer them just question just question just think about the question not the answer so when you write down remember there's no need for the answer only the question if the answer comes perfect but just write the questions all of them that you just can't imagine remember not question Beginning by why what for when no only the questions that starts with what what I think what I believe what I say what I do what I have all the ones that starts with what hmm this week we will question ourselves so after all the path that we have taken with answers with ideas all the things that we have done in this past month the time has come to make all the questions all the questions as possible to begin with this path on the Earth let's go to the alignment don't write down the questions like what is a star no the questions is for Aries Aries so it's about yourself what I have what I think what I believe I I I today a new vibration the preparation for today is God the statement for today is I am the universal audition the code for J is Andromeda Andromeda system is a group of suns and stars that have as background the Galaxy with the same name the expressed conscience in that space usually embodies the meaning of its name from the Greek protector of men however it's Aries Guardian protector of the beginning of all things so it's perfect for today remember that for this month the Mantra is I am preparation is comfortable close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing all right I become aware of the body I find myself in the room I find myself in and my own breathing thank you I visualize a tiny light upon my head I visualize its color its brightness I become aware that this tiny light is the spark of my spirit the one that originates all my realities I start to attract it towards me expanding his spark in my crown as I make the question what I believe I feel this Divine spark descending in between my eyes and die sets intention to ignite it breathe thank you and when heated Knights I make the question what I think I take a deep breath and bring this Divine Spark down to the throat and I feel it ignite him inside of the throat and diming the question what I say thank you breathe and Ascend the Divine Spark to the heart I feel the Divine sparse expanding coming out through my heart and I make the question what I feel foreign Spark to my solar plexus with every breathing I feel this Divine spark starting to expand shine to every direction and I make the question what am I expand this part foreign and I start to descend this Divine spark to the sacrament I start to feel by every breathing how this Divine spark expands in thousands of parts of creation and I make the question what I do I descend this Divine spark to my root chakra I unite this park towards every direction breathe in 19 the road chakra I do the question what I have thank you thank you foreign this divine's part to my knees I take the breath igniting the sparks in both means and I activate give them the question what I look for foreign and bring this Divine Spark towards the feet into my ankles I become aware of these parts igniting expanding all over the floor from my ankles breathe and I make the question what I'm host thank you and I become aware that each one of these questions through this Divine Spark opens every one of the doors for the spirit to be Here and Now I expand all these Divine Sparks through all the directions from me activating the spirits of the beginning enlightenment Delight so I can see the universe God foreign of the universe I am the vision of the universe I am the vision of the universe I am the question I am take a deep breath I breathe deep doing strength and breathe out relaxing breathe in again with all the tension and I breathe out relaxing releasing the tension and each one at its own Time come back here and now
