# Day 165 - Family: The Evolutionary Bond

**Author:** Mathias de Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Sacral Chakra
- **Week Theme:** Emotional Week of Capricorn
- **Main Topic:** Family
- **Vibration:** `Yeah` (Atlantean sound formation representing the statement)
- **Statement:** `I am the being's home`
- **Code:** Manifestation - The smallest particles of the cosmos don't function as units of matter but as waves and vibration that are limitless in the laws of time and space. However, they are the foundations of all limits and patterns schematized in the laws of the material worlds. This is the faculty of the universe of manifesting, of using the unlimited tools of the cosmos to generate forms and diverse existences. Who connects with the world of infinite ideas is able to materialize whatever they want in reality.

## Overview

Today's topic is family, which carries special significance depending on cultural context. For someone Italian-Argentinian, family is everything—almost an obligation. "Family is first" is a concept heard across all cultures. The family is considered the most important thing because to exist, you have to be born into a family.

This teaching explores family from a deeply evolutionary and biological perspective, stripping away romantic notions to reveal the fundamental truth: everything you are, everything you feel—the traumas, the patterns, everything that makes you who you are right now—is because of the family.

Nobody is away from the concept of family. Even those who are orphans have family, because family is not blood. Family is mainly the people you have grown with and the people you eat with. When you share food with people, that's family. The word "family" comes from "famine," which relates to hunger. A "famished" person is one who is very hungry.

This session was prepared while working on the itinerary for the last part of the year, embodying the focused, work-driven energy of Capricorn. The teaching invites us to examine what family truly is, why we need it, and whether we are choosing it or being obligated by it.

## Core Teaching

### Humans Are Animals

First of all, it's important to understand that we are not going to see this from the point of view of humans before we understand a human. We have to grasp this idea: we are animals. The only thing that separates humans from animals is that we have intelligence and that we can manifest and create through imagination. That's it. We are intelligent, we think, and we can manifest through imagination. For the rest, we are animals.

### The Three Basic Needs of the Body

To identify our animal aspect, all of us as animals have only three things that our bodies want. Our organic, biological body wants only three things:

1. **To eat**
2. **To reproduce**
3. **To sleep**

If the body can have only these three things, the body is happy. That's it. Perfect. For an animal, an animated being—the one that is animated—the animal needs only these three things to exist. If you're a person that just wants to eat, wants to have sex, and then sleep, you can say you are actually an animal and not thinking very much. You can identify at which level you are—still an animal or a human—through this very basic system.

### The Energy Cycle of Survival

Why do we need to eat? Eat is the first thing. We need to eat because food has energy, and when we eat, we store energy. Why do we need energy? Because we need to have sex, to reproduce. To have a sexual relation takes a lot of energy, so you need to eat in order to have good energy for reproduction. When you waste all the energy of reproduction, then you have to sleep to restore the energy and go at it again.

That's the simple circle. Any living being in biology needs this energy. You have to take energy from outside, so you store the energy by eating. Through eating, you have energy to reproduce, to make the cellular division or the reproduction by sexuality. That process wastes a lot of energy, and then you re-establish the system by sleeping.

This simple system is all based on the need of food, on the research of something to eat. The body makes sure you need this energy by being hungry, by starving. The body says, "I need energy" through the concept of starvation.

### The Evolution of Group Survival

Let's remember how these beings, these organisms, started to eat the energy, to take the energy. Some beings start to look for this energy outside by themselves, alone. They just take the energy, the information from the environment by themselves. But some of them understand that it's impossible to eat a lot or to take a lot of energy if they work alone. So they need to work in groups.

They start to create this connection, this interaction with others, so they could get much more energy and information and food. They start to work together by feeling, by perceiving the movement of others. This process of evolution makes insects, fishes, and birds start to work together in order to get something in groups so they can survive better.

This extrasensory perception starts to evolve in feeling how the other moves. You see the fishes moving in shoals, constantly exactly the same. You have the birds that fly all together in flocks. The mammals, the animals in herds—all these different animals start to work together, aligned, to reach food, to reach better places to have energy to eat.

### The Birth of Emotion

This energy that they share, that they perceive, is what we start to call emotion. All of them are somehow connected to the first emotion, which was to try to be together and to feel one another, to be in a group. That's the origin of what we as humans used to call love—to love one another, to be in a relationship between different beings.

But as you see, this just started by the need of getting much more resources to eat. The first need is to eat, and it's the one that makes different animals, different individuals in the animal kingdom, get together in herds, in flocks, in shoals, to be together in order to get better results when they are trying to find food.

### The Evolution of Mammals and Communication

Through thousands of years, when the mammals appear, they start to make this system even more perfect. They start to interact with one another emotionally, like the mothers taking care of the babies. They start to create the herds so all of them protect one another, and they start also to use some sounds to communicate and to give names to one another. This optimized the communication and the results of what they are trying to reach.

### From Hominids to Humans

From the mammals appear hominids. The hominids are the ones that are intelligent. There are many beings that are intelligent—like the octopus, the whales, dogs, cats—they are intelligent because they can use the environment, they can use tools. That's a kind of intelligence. For example, intelligence is recognizing "this is a pen and this is blue," and maybe one of those animals can too.

But the difference between those intelligent animals and humans is that we can also say, "This is a tool and I can draw with this, and I can download information from my ideas into the material physical world and create something new, something different." And I can pass on this information.

Remember that there are many other beings that are intelligent, that know how to use tools, but the hominids started to use the tools to pass on information of the dreams.

### The Human Level of Evolution

From the hominids, we have another group that are the humans. Humans are these beings that are not only intelligent but also are able to create and live through the intelligence. That means that humans were able to create cultures, to communicate with languages, to create civilizations, to live with religion, traditions, all these kinds of things, education.

This creates a species—humans—that instead of just using tools, they use the world around, living in a structure that is not physical but conceptual.

### Homo Sapiens Sapiens: The Aware Human

After this, we have the homo sapiens sapiens inside the humans, which is the human that is aware. The human that is aware is not conditioned by the cultures, the herds, the laws, anything. It's its own, by itself, free. It uses free will. It can relate everything to itself and be aware how to handle, how to transform everything around, being free from all the systems.

### The Purpose of Evolution

All this process of evolution—from the very first cell that was just trying to observe, to absorb energy from around, and all this process of great evolution until we as humans trying to create civilizations and so on with cultures—all this has been only different ways of evolution to help us with these three basic things: eat, reproduce, and sleep.

Imagine, don't you think that all the things we have accomplished until now as humanity in these millions of years of evolution was just to eat better, have better sex, and sleep more quietly?

One of the reasons why we can tell we are still living through these three basic things is basically because we are still today, with all this evolution, living still through the idea of the family.

### Why Family Exists

All this history of evolution was just because individuals were starving. We needed food, we needed to eat. By living together, we create an option to have much more food, to have many more options to find food. By this, we started to help one another, creating more resources, working much more with everyone. The reason why we get all together is because we are hungry. We need to survive, and as many we work together, we are going to eat better.

As animals, we created these invisible links by resonance in order to help us to be together as one so we can find resources to eat. These emotional links that we created, this interaction between the beings, is all about survival. It's all about helping us to have links so we ensure the survival of the group.

### Love as Chemical Reaction

These links that we experience in our families—we as humans say this is a special spiritual link from other lives and so on—but let's kill the magic here too. The same feelings that we feel for others in our heart is the same thing that the ants feel in a nest.

Just check an ant nest when you go to see the ants and how they work. You will see that everyone knows exactly what they have to do, but they don't have laws, they don't have nothing written, they don't speak to one another to say "you have to do this or that or that." No, they just know. They just resonate with the others in what they have to do.

You don't see in the ant's nest everyone connected with physical links. They're connected with different resonating links, maybe hormonal reactions that share information that tells them what to do.

Now let's go into the human perspective. We as humans have evolved to understand this same link of the ants in a different way, and we call that love. We call love what ants do every day—going back and forward and not hitting each other, not crushing one another. We just made the idea much more romantic, much more beautiful with imagination.

But the love that we feel between one another in our families is just an evolved way of relation, of chemical relation, like the ants in a nest. Sorry for killing the magic, but it's basically that.

### Evolution of Emotional Perception

All these links that we call love in between the people from the family and so on, they are all chemical reactions. It's all about hormones, and that's it.

What we did in our evolution is to put all that information that we usually feel by chemical reactions into our brain. We brought this idea into the imagination. We started to work with this opened perception of what before we felt in the physical way. Now we feel it when we see someone speaking, when we see someone in the screen, when we just listen to music, or whatever.

Basically, everything that we feel emotionally is a chemical reaction. This is why I feel the smell or the colors of the people that are going to nourish me, because it's all about eating. And I feel horrible smells and horrible colors with the people that you feel will bring something wrong to you.

### Family vs. Clan

Family is not specifically a concept of blood, of historical genetics. It's about what am I eating in the world, what are the people I am sharing with so I can survive. That's a family.

There's a difference between family and the clan:

**Family** is the ones you share food with, so you get nourished by them and with them.

**Clan** comes from the word "plan," and plan means to extend. That's the origin of the word "plain." The plane is to plan something, a planification. This gives the origin to the word "plant," a plantation. A plant that is extended is the clan—a group of people that has a kid and extends themselves in different territories and branches, creating the plant that we call the tree, the genealogical tree.

The difference between a clan (which is the genealogical) and a family is that you can have a clan but a different family, because this plant maybe is not nourishing you as you expect and you can look for others to nourish you better. Of course, normally we mix the clan and the family, but they don't have to be together. We have a clan and we have a family.

### The Capricornian Question

Now think about this. The question now would be: if you are still in a family and you say to yourself, "This is my family," the question would be, what is the concept of why you are still in the need of being in that family?

What I mean about this is that you have to ask yourself: what am I still in need of this clan? Because remember, one thing is the clan and another is the family. If you consider the clan still your family, the question should be: what am I needing of this clan still? Why am I still here in this clan?

Because I can create a new family to look for something different. But if I come back again to the same family, the same clan, it's because I'm still needing something from that clan. That's the structure of the family.

So the very Capricornian question here would be: **What is my family useful for?**

### Where Is the Soul and Spirit?

For sure, some of you maybe are asking yourself, "What about the soul and the spirit? Where are they?" Because it seems like I have killed all the spiritual world right now.

The answer would be: just check the last 160 videos from the last months, where you can find the soul and the spirit.

Just as a summary: remember, the physical world, this thing, is energy. So everything is created by energy. This energy, how do we call the energy in the universe? We call it soul. The soul is vibration. The energy is vibration. What is vibration? It's the spirit.

So the spirit turns to be the soul, and the soul becomes the matter in the body. They are not different things, separate things, one inside the other. They are the same thing in different levels of vibration.

For example, when we say the solar plexus is not a chakra outside, separated from the body. The solar plexus in our body is called pancreas. It's nothing. It's just the physical aspect of the energy that creates the pancreas that we call the plexus. It's the same thing.

### Family Is a Choice, Not an Obligation

Just to understand this last concept: remember that we are not here to say we have to get rid of the clans or we have to get rid of the family in order to feel free. No. Family and clans are good because in this world it's useful. It was the way in which we evolved. So they are really good tools to understand how to evolve in this planet.

There are no bad things. We don't have to take them away in order to think about a new society. No, they are natural. It's natural evolution. So it's not about getting rid of some of them. It's about understanding what are they here for, why am I inside of them, to become aware of why I am inside a family, what do I need, what is it useful for.

Remember, the only thing that we have to change from the idea of family is that **family is a choice, not an obligation**—if we are aware.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes.

Take deep breaths.

### Entering the Space

Become aware of the environment around me. Feel the size of this environment.

Use my imagination to make it as a night, darker with shadows, with a deep sky full of stars.

As I see the stars, I perceive how a fire lights in front of me. I start to feel the heat in my hands, my chest, and my face.

### Observing the Fire

I observe the fire, straight to it. See its orange colors and its flames moving like a snake.

I recognize that I am in a circle with much more people around the fire.

### Recognizing the Family

I observe the fire, and inside of it I find the clue of what is uniting all these people around. This clue is the family.

I observe how the light of the fire shines from the faces of these people so I can recognize them. They are my family, my clan.

Without judging, just observe all the people of your family, of your own clan. It doesn't matter if they have been good or bad with me. It doesn't matter if they are dead or alive.

The only thing that matters is that they are all here around the fire at the same distance.

### Asking the Questions

This fire is the one that brings clarity to all the needs of this family.

So I ask myself: **What is my role in this family?**

**What is holding me united to this family, or as a slave of this family?**

I allow myself to perceive this in the fire and in their faces.

Take a deep breath.

Ask yourself, I ask myself: **What is what I need from this family?**

As I perceive and see the answer, I start to vibrate, making it resonate within me, bringing the answer towards my heart.

### Vibration Integration

**I am...**

[Allow the vibration to resonate]

### Recognition and Choice

**This is not the family that I am living in. This is the family that I choose.**

This family is not a must, an obligation. This family was my choice.

### Honoring the Family

I honor every one of those who are in my family, in this clan around me now. I honor them because they show me those things that I need.

I honor them because they give me whatever they can in their way for my own evolution.

Without any judgment, I sense: **I choose my family.**

### Final Statement

And my family is the home of my being.

**I am the home of the being.**
**I am the home of the being.**
**I am the home of the being.**

### Closing

I bring it to each cell of my body, increasing, stretching, and yawning.

Each one in its own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

The task for today is to write down the reasons you find of why you are still in this family. Why do you need this family?

### Applying This Teaching

Examine your relationship with your family and clan. Distinguish between the two:
- Who are the people in your genealogical clan?
- Who are the people in your chosen family (those you share food with)?
- What needs are being met by your family?
- Are you choosing your family or feeling obligated by it?

Recognize that becoming aware of why you are in a family is not about rejecting family or clan. It's about understanding their purpose and transforming obligation into conscious choice.

Ask yourself the Capricornian questions:
- What is my role in this family?
- What am I still needing from this clan?
- What is my family useful for?
- Am I choosing this family or being enslaved by it?

Honor your family for showing you what you need and for giving you what they can for your evolution, without judgment.

## Q&A

### Q: Are humans really just animals?

Yes, from a biological perspective. Humans are animals. The only differences are that we have intelligence and can manifest and create through imagination. For everything else—our basic needs and survival instincts—we function as animals. Our bodies want only three things: to eat, to reproduce, and to sleep.

### Q: Is love just a chemical reaction?

From an evolutionary and biological perspective, yes. The love we feel in our families is an evolved way of chemical relation, similar to what ants experience in a nest through hormonal reactions. We have evolved to process these chemical reactions through our brain and imagination, making them feel more romantic and spiritual, but fundamentally they are hormonal and chemical responses designed to ensure survival.

### Q: What is the difference between family and clan?

Family is the people you share food with—those who nourish you and with whom you get nourished. Clan comes from the word "plan" (to extend) and refers to your genealogical tree—the extended plant of people related by blood. You can have a clan but choose a different family if that clan is not nourishing you as you need.

### Q: Why do we create families?

Throughout evolution, individuals created families because they were starving and needed to eat. By living together, we created options to have much more food and resources. The invisible links we created through resonance—what we call emotional bonds—are all about survival, ensuring the survival of the group through cooperation.

### Q: Where is the soul and spirit in this biological view?

The physical world is energy. The energy of the universe is what we call soul. The soul is vibration, and vibration is the spirit. So the spirit becomes the soul, and the soul becomes matter in the body. They are not separate things—they are the same thing in different levels of vibration. For example, the solar plexus chakra is the energetic aspect of what we call the pancreas in the physical body.

### Q: Does this mean we should reject the concept of family?

No. We are not here to get rid of clans or families. They are good because they are useful in this world. They are the way we evolved. Family and clans are really good tools to understand how to evolve on this planet. They are natural, part of natural evolution. It's not about getting rid of them—it's about understanding what they are here for and why we are inside of them.

### Q: What does "family is a choice, not an obligation" mean?

If we are aware, we can recognize that we have the power to choose our family rather than feeling obligated by genetic or cultural bonds. This doesn't mean rejecting your clan, but rather becoming conscious of why you are in that family, what you need from them, and whether you are choosing them or feeling enslaved by them. Awareness transforms obligation into choice.

### Q: What is the Capricornian question about family?

The very Capricornian question is: "What is my family useful for?" This practical, grounded question asks you to examine what needs your family meets, what role you play, and whether you are in this family by choice or obligation. It's about becoming aware of the function and purpose of family in your life.
