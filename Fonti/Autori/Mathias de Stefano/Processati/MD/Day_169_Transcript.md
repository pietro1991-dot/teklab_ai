## Introduction

Hi everyone , morning , afternoon , good evening.

So let 's go into the topic for today which is beliefs related to the ankles , chara , the feet in the emotional of capricorn.

So just to remind you that we tomorrow we finish with the emotional week of capricorn and we still have 10 days more of the physical aspect of capricorn. Even though remember that we are doing this according to the Atlantic calendar , which is not about astrology.

So according to astrology , the tropical astrology , today we begin with Aquarium.

So today we begin the energy of Aquarium , even though we are going to keep working with capricorn. But it 's good to know that today we start with this new energy.

So let 's begin with this really good topic for today which is beliefs. And this is something that we can not escape , sorry , but nobody can escape from the beliefs. And now we are to understand why we can not escape from our beliefs and how we can handle them. Also trying to understand the origin of this concept which for sure many of you , like I did until today , we thought it was related to the mind.

Not so let 's go into this topic.

So just to remind to all the people that are joining us right now and maybe you are saying , what is this madness?

So I remind you that the blood where you can find all the information of what we are doing every day. And also I thank you all who are helping me to share the blood.

## Q&A

So another thing to say is that remember that in the blood you have all information , everything that we have done until now , all the history , all the data , all the questions , answers , everything is there in the blood.

So you can go around not only to read the post of everyday and also to let you know that we are doing this for free every day with the help of all of you being part of the foundation.

So if you are asking how can I help?

So I could keep on going with this. You can also find in the blood how to collaborate and to help me do this all the time.

So another thing to say for you to understand how this works.

The reason why I do n't say in the video what is the topic of the day is because I do n't know. Basically is because the videos are programmed in a calendar.

So there are a program for you to know where they are going to be but the content of the video I do n't know until the day of the video.

So I write doing the information and then I realize what is the topic and then I explain it to you here but it 's things for a day.

So that 's why I can not announce what is the topic for the day.

So thank you.

So first of all , when we think about what is the belief , usually we bring this idea that a belief is a thought , a thinking , an idea , a pattern of thinking that you have in your head that is constantly brought once again by your mind. That 's a perception that we have of belief from our point of view today. Another way in which we can understand through concepts what is a belief is like for example if the 10th through thousands of years or centuries repeats once again this is black. This is black.

This is black.

Some some at some point you will say this is black , okay but it 's a very much easier way to say that this is black and you to believe it. Which is basically in the moment you are born your mom or you 're that telling you this is black and that 's it for your whole life you will believe that this is black and unless someone teaches you the opposite you will still believe this is black.

So I believe should be something that repeats itself so many times that ends up being a truth for me.

So one factor that we used to say about belief is that we think that I believe is something that you repeat so many times that ends up being a truth but is n't that you just have to remember your school when you were to school for sure repetition was a kind of way a system that teachers used for us to learn but how many of you really learned by repetition that 's very difficult because they make you repeat and repeat and repeat and once again once again you do n't really get the information when you repeat it because your brain says I do n't need this so I will take it away. When we talk about repetition people used to believe that when you repeat you will learn but you are not learning by repetition you 're memorizing which is totally different. When you learn something that means that you are in process of apprehension. Apprehension means that you are taking that information for you as part of yourself.

So when you memorize something is that you are not remembering this for you you are just having that data and encoding that data for you but that 's it.

So that that that thing the repetition like you for example the BC BC the F or like all the all the why do you learn the BC because you repeat it constantly all the time but you are not learning BC you are just the only way you can learn the BC is when you ask yourself why the A is the first one when why the B why then the C you know when you try to understand the origin of that to get it for you otherwise you are memorizing for consciousness.

So the key that you need in order to create a belief is the emotion without emotion you are not assimilation that information as a part of you without emotion you do n't get that data for you you just memorize things that then you will forgive for forget sorry then you will forget.

So according to the emotion of what we feel when we when we achieve something we create a new belief and why is that why is the motion because whatever you assimilate for yourself you have to fill it within yourself before that it as a part of you otherwise it 's just just data.

Today maybe it 's silly but for sure the first moment that you were able to say the out of it all together like BCE , Fiji , alter and you ended up doing it by your own there was an emotion that you felt like I did it and when you had this emotion is the moment when you learned the BC it 's not because you were repeating it is because of the emotion of a covalent okay that 's the moment when you got it by the emotion so this is why we know everything through beliefs because of this emotion and now let 's go to understand why for those who hate languages I 'm sorry but I love its biology. The word belief sorry in Spanish credits comes from the middle word that is creed in Latin. Care that comes from creed means heart and there comes from the the means to put heart put so beliefs credits comes from the word action of putting something within the heart.

So belief credits has nothing in common with the mind with the brain with thoughts ideas no I believe credits comes only to me it becomes to me in the right moment when I feel an emotion and it 's only through the emotion that I put that in my heart so I so it becomes the part of me so I believe it 's not what I think is what I feel so the technology of belief comes from B which is to be and live in your European that means love.

So to be in English means to be in love. Do you think that this is amazing that two such different languages that sound so different they got the same origin , same feeling.

Okay so here comes the concept of I believe in order to believe in something I have to feel something I have to be in an emotional relationship with something otherwise I can not feel.

So the only way you can believe something is when you are in love with with something the joy and a relation with an idea with something.

So here comes if I believe is something that in order to have it I need to feel it.

So sometimes in our cultures we think that that 's what we call faith. Faith is something that you feel that it 's just and it 's not. It 's exactly the opposite. Faith is a complementary of belief but it 's not a synonym.

Faith is in the mind and we have the lead for so long that faith is in the heart but it 's not.

So here comes one of the most amazing energies of the day starting at queries breaking all these concepts of the patterns in Capricorn.

Okay so let 's go to faith.

So let 's go into what faith. Faith comes from the European paint. Faith means how do you say this in English?

Someone who assists you. And a biker maybe I guess advisor.

So it 's like an advisor which is the one that assists you.

Someone that is assisting you. Assistant , distant from the Latin word , the ones that see the ones that is seated with you to discuss. Is the one that is seated with you? The assist stands the one that sits.

Okay to try what? To try to convince you? To try to convince you? About what?

About a law? And what is law?

Something Leo. You see how it comes?

So what is faith? Faith is talking about something that I had n't felt that I had n't felt , that I had no idea I had no experience at all but someone with me someone sat with me to explain and try to convince me that this word that this person is telling to me is a law. It 's something true.

So I believe that just because that person comes me.

Okay because that person was helping me to understand something.

So I now believe that this is true. I have faith because I have never experienced that before. I just trust that person that told me that.

So remember what is faith? Faith is an idea. Faith comes from the mind because it is related with something. The faith is related to an idea.

Someone telling me what to believe. In a book for example is a word that is said.

So I believe the word that someone explained me in a book. A tradition , a religion like in the Torah , the Quran , the society , the politician , the lawyer , your mom , dad , a partner , a lover.

So it 's a word that you speak. And the other person is you that that word is true is a law.

Okay?

So faith is related to the ability to speak and convince the other and convince. Comes from the emoji to the feet altogether. That 's the word. Condensed someone is to defeat the whole thing together.

So faith is this has not the ability to feel. The faith , the people that has faith is the people that has n't the opportunity to feel so so accept the word of others , the truth of others.

So for example , many of you , if you had n't feel or had experience of what I am saying , for sure you will have faith in me because you had n't experienced that but maybe you accept what I say.

So if you accept what I say you have faith in what I say , but will come someday the moment when you had experience and leave by your own self , this things that I am saying.

So that 's the moment when it will turn in that belief because you had experience.

So let 's go to another comparison.

So now we have here an external and internal ways of seeing this. Faith comes from the feet which is to convince from the mind and then from the internal point of view I have to believe which comes from care , hard which is the emotional aspect. The emotional aspect.

So in the external aspect the word , the verb that will bring in one word all this concept of the mind , convincing and so on , into trust. In English comes from another etymology but we can call this confidence to have confidence in something.

So we have the same etymology. Confidence.

So this is the the verb that makes the summary of to convince through the mind. Conflict confidence. And then from the heart , sorry , and then from the internal aspect I will have to put together in the heart everything that I feel that I believe in only one bird.

So from the internal point of view we have that all this concepts must come back to the heart.

So we need only one word that brings me to the idea of what it is to go back to the heart.

So again like here we have an English remember. But the way in which we will relate it will be recording comes from cord also the heart , so it is to remember to put everything together , register all the data within me. That 's recording to put everything in the heart.

So let 's try to understand this. In order to find out who I am , to go to the deepest part of myself and understand what am I. I have to remember which means to go to put everything together again to the records , the records that are in my heart which is to come back to see what I have within in my heart. But that heart , that heart kept all this information inside because of your beliefs , because the emotion of the beliefs that you storage through thousands of years through your life.

So your beliefs are the path , the map to lead , to guide you to your heart , to who you are.

So when we say sometimes we have to get rid of the beliefs because they mess up with your mind. It 's not that the belief is the path through your heart to let you know what you have become. The beliefs are your tools to know what you are now.

So our path is not about to eliminate beliefs to get rid of the patterns of belief. When we have to do is to put consciousness , clarity to our beliefs , to understand the meaning to become aware of them so we can use them. To put awareness to what I feel.

So the task for today regarding this issue is to write down your beliefs and try to understand what are they in my life. How can I use them? How can I bring clarity to them? To understand where they came from and why do I need them?

And if you want an example , read the blog. I hope this is useful for you now or in another future.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to information for today. View. The vibration for today is view. The statement for today is I am home of apprentices.

The code for today is Origin. All the universal space is contribute constantly to the fundamental basis of manifestation and geometry that we call atoms from the Greek without any division. The most abundant ones in the universe around 90 % are Origin H. Being at the same time , the one of highest quantity in the visible and physical world in a 75 % meaning generator of water , it 's who carries the information of the cops consciousness , the memory and record of all we are , we wear and will be.

So this next day we will be trying to assimilate the 12 basis elemental basis of our existence the atoms. Let 's go to the diamond.

So we close the rise. We see it comfortable and concentrate in your breathing. The side reads , I let all the weight of my body fall down. As I think about the environment , I find myself in.

With my imagination , I start to design the environment as a deep and dark night with this kind of full of stars. One. . .

I observed how in front of me a fire ignites. I can see its beautiful colours , yellow , orange and red , and its flames. Let it cool down! I focus in this fire , as I feel the heat in my hands , my chest , my face.

I recognize that this fire is the fire of my heart and everything that it 's enlightened are my beliefs. I recognize that each one of these beliefs is a process of experience of learning , of apprehension. Express in an apprentice that I incorporate a simulated within me in the home that is my body. I realize that I am not alone around the fire that it 's light , shine on the faces , of the experiences of the people that represent the supreme apprehension of my beliefs.

I observe around the faces of my beliefs , emotional beliefs , religious spiritual , physical , political , philosophical beliefs. All of them are seated around the fire. They are the people that I relate with these beliefs. I observe them.

I recognize that all these people , all these beliefs are just an emotional perception of the truth , but they are not the truth. I must accept that they are just my own perception. And by accepting that they are not the truth , I recognize myself free in order to use them to create a new reality. To transform myself.

I become aware that all these beliefs are not my goal , that all these beliefs are the path that leads me to my own art.

So I set intention for them to come to me. I do n't have to go looking for them. They must come to me to my heart. With my hands breathing , I start to attract this fire to my heart and all these beliefs within me.

And I sing to them to archive in my body. In my singing , I bring conscious and clarity to my beliefs. I sing to them to my heart. I sing to them to my heart.

I sing to them to my heart. I sing to them to my heart. With my hands breathing , I start to attract this fire to my heart. I am the home of the apprentice.

I am the home of the apprentice. All the beliefs live in my heart. And I recognize that these beliefs are not used to me anymore. From my confidence , I set the intention that I am the one used and instead for my own evolution.

I use , I use , I use. Take a deep breath and with your hands , start to move this consciousness all throughout body , I carry the strength of my heart. And each one , and sometimes come back here and now.

Remember to write down about your beliefs and how to make them into tools. Thank you everybody for being there as always. And see you tomorrow , at the same time. To close the emotional wake of Capricorn.
