## Overview

On January 19th, as the **Emotional Week of Capricorn** comes to a close (and Aquarius energy begins in tropical astrology), Matias addresses one of the most fundamental aspects of human experience: **Beliefs**. This teaching completely revolutionizes our understanding of where beliefs come from and how they're formed.

The revelation: **Beliefs are not created in the mind—they are created in the heart through emotion.** The word "believe" comes from the same Latin root as "heart" (**cor/cordis**), revealing that **beliefs are recorded in the heart, not thought in the mind**.

We've been taught that **repetition creates belief**—that if you repeat something enough times, you'll believe it. But this is false. **Repetition creates memorization, not learning.** True belief only occurs when **emotion is present**—when you **feel** something deeply, when your heart **records** the experience. Without emotion, there is no assimilation, no integration, no belief.

This teaching challenges everything we think we know about education, religion, culture, and personal transformation. **You cannot believe something truly unless your heart has felt it.** And this means: every belief you hold was **created through emotion, recorded in your heart, and stored in your body**—not constructed through logic or repetition in your mind.

The **Ankles Chakra** is where we **walk our beliefs**—where what we believe becomes how we move through the world.

## Core Teaching

### The Cultural Misconception About Beliefs

When we think about **beliefs**, we usually bring this idea:

**"A belief is a thought, a thinking, an idea, a pattern of thinking that you have in your head that is constantly brought once again by your mind."**

That's the **perception** we have of belief from our modern point of view.

### The Repetition Myth

Another way we understand belief:

**"If through thousands of years or centuries, someone repeats once again: 'This is black, this is black, this is black'—at some point you will say 'this is black.'"**

But there's a much easier way: **the moment you are born, your mom or dad tells you "this is black," and that's it**—for your whole life you will believe that this is black, unless someone teaches you the opposite.

So **belief should be something that repeats itself so many times that it ends up being a truth for me**.

### School and Repetition

Remember your school: **repetition was a system that teachers used** to help us learn.

But **how many of you really learned by repetition?**

It's very difficult, because **when they make you repeat and repeat and repeat once and again, you don't really get the information when you repeat it**. Your brain says: **"I don't need this, so I will take it away."**

**When we talk about repetition, people believe that when you repeat you will learn. But you are NOT learning by repetition—you are MEMORIZING, which is totally different.**

### Learning vs. Memorizing

**Learning = Apprehension**
- Apprehension means you are **taking that information for you as part of yourself**
- You are **integrating** it into your being
- It becomes **part of who you are**

**Memorizing = Encoding**
- You are just **having that data and encoding it**
- You're not **remembering** this for you
- You're just storing information **externally**, not integrating it

**Example: The Alphabet**

Think of the ABC, the alphabet. You learned the ABC because you **repeated it constantly all the time**.

But **you are not learning the ABC—you are just memorizing it**.

The only way you can **learn** the ABC is when you ask yourself:
- **Why is A the first one?**
- **Why then B?**
- **Why then C?**

When you try to **understand the origin** of that, to **get it for you**, **then** you are learning.

Otherwise, you are **memorizing for consciousness**—storing data without understanding or integration.

### The Key: Emotion

**The key you need in order to create a belief is EMOTION.**

**Without emotion, you are not assimilating that information as a part of you.**

**Without emotion, you don't get that data for you—you just memorize things that you will later forget.**

**According to the emotion of what we feel when we achieve something, we create a new belief.**

### Why Emotion Creates Belief

**Why is it emotion? Because whatever you assimilate for yourself, you have to FEEL it within yourself before taking it as a part of you.**

**Otherwise, it's just data.**

**Example: The Alphabet Again**

Maybe it seems silly, but think about the first moment you were able to say the whole alphabet together—like "ABC DEF GHI JKL MNO PQR STU VWX YZ"—and you ended up doing it by your own.

**There was an emotion you felt: "I did it!"**

**That emotion—that feeling of accomplishment—is the moment when you LEARNED the ABC.**

It's not because you were repeating it. It's because of the **emotion of achievement**.

**That's the moment when you got it.** By the emotion.

### We Know Everything Through Beliefs

**This is why we know everything through beliefs—because of emotion.**

Now let's understand **why this is true** by going to the **etymology of the word "believe."**

### The Etymology of Believe

**Believe** comes from Latin, but to understand it, we must trace it through multiple languages.

**In Latin:**
- **"Cor"** or **"Cordis"** = Heart
- **"Recordo"** = To record, to remember
- **"Dis-cordo"** = Discord, to not agree (literally "separation from the heart")
- **"Con-cordo"** = Concord, to agree (literally "with the heart")

**The root "cor" (heart) is the foundation of belief.**

**In Spanish:**
- **"Creer"** (to believe) comes from Latin **"credere"**
- **"Credere"** = to trust, to have faith, to give one's heart to

**In English:**
- **"Believe"** comes from Old English **"gelēafa"** (faith, belief)
- Which comes from Proto-Germanic **"ga-laubon"** (to trust, to hold dear)
- Which connects to Latin **"libet"** (it pleases) and **"libido"** (desire)
- All rooted in the heart, in feeling, in emotion

**But the deepest connection is to Latin "cor" (heart).**

### Believe = To Record in the Heart

**The fundamental truth:**

**"Believe"** is related to **"cor"** (heart) and **"recordo"** (to record).

**To believe = to record in the heart.**

**Beliefs are not created in the mind through repetition. Beliefs are RECORDED in the HEART through EMOTION.**

When you **feel** something deeply, your **heart records** it. **That recording becomes your belief.**

### Faith vs. Belief

**Faith** also comes from the same root—**the heart**, not the mind.

**Faith = "fides"** (Latin) = trust, confidence, belief
- Related to **"cor"** (heart)
- **To have faith = to give your heart to something**

**Both belief and faith are matters of the heart, not the mind.**

This is why you can **know** something intellectually without **believing** it. You can have all the mental data, all the logical proof, but **if your heart hasn't felt it, hasn't recorded it emotionally, you won't believe it**.

### Recording: The Body's Memory

**"Recordo"** (Latin) = **to record, to remember**

But **where** does the body record?

**Not in the brain alone—in the HEART, in the cells, in the body.**

**Your body records experiences through emotion.**

When something happens and you **feel** it deeply:
- Your heart **records** it
- Your cells **store** it
- Your body **remembers** it
- This becomes a **belief**

**This is why beliefs are so hard to change with logic alone.** Because they're not stored in your logical mind—they're **recorded in your emotional body, in your heart, in your cells**.

### Emotion = The Assimilation Key

**To assimilate something = to make it part of yourself.**

**The only way to assimilate is through EMOTION.**

Think about any significant learning in your life:
- The first time you rode a bike (fear, then triumph)
- The first time you said "I love you" (vulnerability, courage)
- A moment of deep insight (awe, recognition)
- A traumatic event (fear, pain, shock)

**All of these created BELIEFS because of the EMOTION you felt.**

**Without the emotion, these would just be memories—data stored externally. With the emotion, they became BELIEFS—truths recorded in your heart.**

### Why We Can't Escape Beliefs

Matias says clearly: **"Nobody can escape from beliefs."**

**Why?**

Because **every moment you FEEL something, you are creating a belief.**

As long as you are a **feeling being** with a **heart** that **records** emotional experiences, **you are constantly creating beliefs**.

**The question is not:** "How do I stop having beliefs?"

**The question is:** "What am I believing? What is my heart recording? What emotions are creating my beliefs?"

### The Ankles: Walking Your Beliefs

The **Ankles Chakra** is where we **ground** our beliefs into action, where we **walk** our truth.

**Ankles connect:**
- The feet (grounded in earth, in matter)
- The legs (movement, walking, journey)
- The body (where beliefs are stored in cells and heart)

**When your beliefs are recorded in your heart, you WALK them with your ankles.**

**Your beliefs become your path.** The way you move through the world, the direction you walk, the ground you choose—all of this is **determined by what your heart has recorded as true**.

**"I Am the Home of Apprentices"** means:
- You are the space where **learning** (not just memorizing) happens
- You are the **home** where beliefs are **recorded through emotional experience**
- You are the **ground** where **apprentices** (those learning to walk their truth) discover what they truly believe

### Beliefs in the Body

**Key understanding:** Beliefs are not abstract mental constructs. **They are stored in your BODY.**

**Where in the body?**
- In the **heart** (the recording center)
- In the **cells** (cellular memory)
- In the **nervous system** (emotional patterns)
- In the **chakras** (energetic beliefs)
- In the **ankles** (how you walk your beliefs into the world)

**This is why:**
- You can **know** something is irrational but still **believe** it (because it's in your heart, not your mind)
- You can be **told** something is true but not **believe** it (because your heart hasn't felt it)
- You can **change your mind** easily but struggle to **change your beliefs** (because beliefs are in your body, not your thoughts)

**Beliefs are EMBODIED truths, recorded through emotion.**

### The Alphabet Example (Full Meaning)

Let's return to the alphabet example with full understanding:

**Stage 1: Repetition**
- Teacher says: "A B C D E F G..."
- You repeat: "A B C D E F G..."
- **This is MEMORIZATION**—encoding data externally

**Stage 2: Practice**
- You try to say it on your own
- You struggle, make mistakes, keep trying
- **This is still MEMORIZATION**—no belief yet

**Stage 3: Achievement**
- Finally, you say the whole alphabet perfectly on your own
- **You FEEL the emotion:** "I did it!"
- **This is the moment of BELIEF**—your heart records "I can do this"

**What you believe is NOT "A comes before B."**

**What you believe is: "I am capable of learning. I can achieve. I can master this."**

**The belief was created by the EMOTION, not the repetition.**

### Healing Beliefs

If beliefs are recorded in the heart through emotion, then **healing beliefs requires emotional processing, not logical argumentation**.

**You cannot change a belief by:**
- Arguing against it logically
- Repeating new information
- Convincing yourself intellectually

**You can only change a belief by:**
- Creating a **new emotional experience**
- Allowing your **heart to record** something different
- **Feeling** the new truth in your body
- **Walking** the new belief with your ankles until your cells remember it

**This is why affirmations often fail:** They're just mental repetition without emotional recording.

**This is why therapy works when it creates emotional shifts:** The heart records new experiences, creating new beliefs.

**This is why trauma creates such deep beliefs:** The intense emotion records the experience indelibly in the heart and body.

### Education, Religion, and Culture

**This teaching reveals why traditional education often fails:**

**Schools use REPETITION** (memorization) when they should be creating **EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES** (learning).

**Religious institutions use DOCTRINE** (mental concepts) when they should be facilitating **HEART EXPERIENCES** (faith).

**Culture uses CONDITIONING** (repeated messaging) when it should be creating **MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES** (true belief).

**If you want someone to truly believe something, you cannot just tell them repeatedly. You must help them FEEL it in their heart.**

### The Emotional Week Conclusion

This is the **final day of the Emotional Week** of Capricorn.

The whole week has been about understanding **how emotions work**, how we **use** them (Capricorn's mantra), how they create our experience.

**Beliefs are the perfect conclusion** because they reveal:

**Emotions are not just feelings—they are RECORDING MECHANISMS.**

Every emotion you feel is **recording a belief in your heart**.

**This is how emotions create your reality:** Not through magic or "manifestation," but through **the beliefs that are recorded in your body based on what you feel**.

## Practice

### Discovering Your Embodied Beliefs

**Setup:** Sit comfortably, close your eyes, take deep breaths.

**Part 1: Scan Your Body**

1. **Bring your awareness to your heart center.**
   - This is where beliefs are recorded.
   - Feel the beating of your heart.

2. **Ask:** "What do I believe about myself?"
   - Don't think the answer—**feel** it.
   - What does your heart say? (Not your mind.)

3. **Notice the emotions** that arise with each belief.
   - Fear, love, shame, pride, joy, sadness?
   - These emotions are **how the belief was recorded**.

**Part 2: Trace the Emotional Recording**

4. **Choose one belief** you discovered.

5. **Ask:** "When did I first FEEL this belief?"
   - Not when you first heard it or thought it
   - When did you **emotionally experience** it?

6. **Remember the moment:**
   - What happened?
   - What did you **feel**?
   - How did your heart **record** it?

7. **Recognize:** This belief was created by **emotion**, not repetition or logic.

**Part 3: Walking Your Beliefs (Ankles)**

8. **Bring awareness to your ankles.**
   - Feel the connection between feet and legs.
   - This is where beliefs become **movement**, where you **walk** your truth.

9. **Ask:** "How do I walk this belief in my life?"
   - How does this belief determine your **direction**?
   - How does it affect **where you go** and **how you move**?

10. **Notice if the belief supports your walking** or **restricts** it.

**Part 4: Creating New Beliefs (If Needed)**

11. **If a belief no longer serves you:**
    - You cannot change it with logic alone
    - You must create a **new emotional experience**
    - Ask: "What would I need to FEEL to record a new belief?"

12. **Imagine feeling that emotion NOW:**
    - Don't just think it—**embody it**
    - Let your heart **record** this new feeling
    - Let your cells **remember** this new truth

**Part 5: Affirm**

13. **"I Am the Home of Apprentices"**
    - You are the space where **true learning** (through emotion) happens
    - You are the **home** where beliefs are recorded
    - You are the **ground** where you walk your embodied truth

14. **Stand if you're able** and **take one step forward** with full awareness:
    - This step is **walking your belief**
    - Your ankles are **grounding your heart's recording** into action
    - You are **apprenticing** in the art of conscious belief

**Closing:**

15. **Breathe deeply** and return to the present moment.

16. **Place your hand on your heart** and feel the recording center of your being.

17. **Know:** Every emotion you feel from this moment forward is **creating your beliefs**. Choose your feelings wisely.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Throughout the day, practice belief awareness:**

1. **Notice when you say or think:** "I believe..."
   - Stop and ask: "Where do I **feel** this belief?" (Not where do I think it—where do I **feel** it?)
   - Place your hand on that part of your body.

2. **Trace the emotion:**
   - What emotion is associated with this belief?
   - When did you first **feel** this emotion in relation to this belief?

3. **Check your ankles:**
   - How are you **walking** this belief?
   - Is it supporting your path or restricting it?

4. **If you want to change a belief:**
   - Don't argue with it logically
   - Don't try to repeat a new thought
   - Instead, **create a new emotional experience**
   - **Feel** the new truth in your body
   - Let your heart **record** it

5. **Remember:** Every strong emotion you feel today is **recording a new belief** or **reinforcing an old one**. Choose your emotional responses consciously.

### Applying This Teaching

- **Stop trying to change beliefs through logic alone**—work with emotion and embodied experience
- **In education or teaching**, create **emotional experiences** that allow learning, not just repetition for memorization
- **In relationships**, understand that people's beliefs come from **heart recordings**, not mental choices—be patient and compassionate
- **With yourself**, be gentle when changing beliefs—you're working with **heart recordings**, which take time and emotional processing
- **Use your ankles** to walk new beliefs into reality—embodied action reinforces heart recordings

### Tomorrow: The Physical Week Begins

Today closes the **Emotional Week** of Capricorn. Tomorrow begins the **Physical Week** with the topic of **Plan**.

**This teaching prepares us:** Understanding that **beliefs are emotional recordings in the body** helps us understand how to **manifest physically** (the Physical Week theme). Physical reality is shaped by **what your body believes** (has recorded emotionally), not what your mind thinks.

**Your beliefs, recorded in your heart through emotion, become the ground** on which you walk and the **foundation** from which you build physical reality.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: Why don't beliefs change when we try to argue against them logically?

Because **beliefs are not stored in the logical mind—they're recorded in the emotional heart and body**. You can have all the logical evidence in the world that a belief is false, but **if your heart hasn't felt a new truth emotionally, the old belief remains**. Logic works on memorized data; emotion works on embodied beliefs. To change a belief, you must **create a new emotional experience** that allows your heart to record something different.

### Q: What's the difference between memorization and learning?

**Memorization** = encoding data externally without integration (you store information but don't assimilate it as part of yourself). **Learning** = apprehension—taking information as part of yourself through emotional experience. **Example:** Repeating the alphabet is memorization; feeling the accomplishment of saying it perfectly is learning. **The emotion is what transforms memorization into learning, data into belief.**

### Q: Why does Matias say nobody can escape from beliefs?

Because **beliefs are created by emotion, and as long as you're a feeling being, you're constantly creating beliefs**. Every time you feel something deeply, your heart records it as a belief. You can't stop being emotional (unless you disconnect from your humanity), so you can't stop creating beliefs. **The question is not "How do I stop having beliefs?" but "What am I believing? What is my heart recording?"**

### Q: How does the etymology of "believe" reveal its true nature?

**"Believe"** connects to Latin **"cor/cordis"** (heart) and **"recordo"** (to record). This reveals that **believing is not a mental process of thinking, but an emotional process of recording in the heart**. Related words like **"concord"** (agreement = with the heart) and **"discord"** (disagreement = separation from the heart) confirm that belief, agreement, and faith are all **matters of the heart, not the mind**.

### Q: What role do the Ankles play in beliefs?

The **Ankles Chakra** is where **beliefs become walking**—where what your heart has recorded becomes **how you move through the world**. Ankles connect the grounded feet to the moving legs, allowing you to **walk your truth**. **Your beliefs determine your path, your direction, your movement.** If your heart has recorded a limiting belief, your ankles will walk a limited path. If your heart records empowerment, your ankles walk freedom.

### Q: If beliefs are recorded through emotion, how do we create new beliefs?

Not through **repetition or logic**, but through **new emotional experiences**:
1. **Feel** the new truth in your body (don't just think it)
2. Create or recall **moments where the new belief was emotionally true**
3. Allow your **heart to record** this new feeling
4. **Walk** the new belief with your ankles (embodied action reinforces the recording)
5. Be **patient**—heart recordings take time to form and solidify

**Affirmations only work if you FEEL them emotionally, not if you just repeat them mentally.**

### Q: Why do schools often fail to create real learning?

Because **traditional education relies on REPETITION** (which creates memorization) instead of **EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE** (which creates learning and belief). Students memorize facts for tests but don't learn them because **there's no emotional recording**. Real education would **create emotional experiences** that allow students to **feel** the truth of what they're learning, causing their hearts to **record** it as belief. **This is why experiential learning, passion-based education, and emotional engagement are so powerful.**

### Q: What does "I Am the Home of Apprentices" mean in this context?

You are the **home** (the space, the ground, the foundation) where **apprentices** (learners, those discovering truth through experience) **record their beliefs through emotional learning**. An **apprentice** doesn't just memorize—they **learn by doing, feeling, experiencing**. You are the **space** where this emotional learning happens, where beliefs are **recorded in the heart** through the **apprenticeship of life**. You are both the student learning and the classroom where learning occurs.
