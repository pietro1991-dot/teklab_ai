# Day 163 - Aid

## Summary

Day 163 dismantles the modern concept of **Help** and reveals its original meaning: **to hold, to support someone in the process of learning**. The word "help" comes from the same root as "hold"—to support something. In Latin, "support" means "to bring" (sub = under, portare = bring), creating the concept of bringing something underneath to hold it up. Help is related to **youth** (the one learning, the one needing to move forward), so **help means supporting someone who is in the process of learning**. The teaching traces the devastating cultural shift: from 10,000 years of feudalism (communities helping each other survive) → 18th century Industrial Revolution (countryside to cities, food becomes money) → competition replacing cooperation → capitalism philosophy spreading to all systems (schools, spirituality, relationships). Today, asking for help is seen as **defeat** because capitalism is about competition, not money. The misconception: "You have to succeed by yourself, you don't need help." The truth: **Asking for help = asking to learn. Giving help = teaching a new way.** Help means teaching or learning so the person becomes **free** to do it themselves. This is not about communism vs capitalism systems—it's about **resigning/transforming the philosophy of help itself**. Help is the future, evolution.

## Key Concepts

### Etymology and Definition
- **Help (English):** Indo-European "help" = to hold
- **Help = Hold** (same word origin, same pronunciation root)
- To hold something = to support something
- **Support:** Latin "sub" (under) + "portare" (bring) = **to bring under, to put underneath**
- Support = bringing something from underneath to hold it up

### Help and Youth (Learning)
- **Youth:** Related to the word for "the one that is learning, the one that needs help, the one in the process of moving forward"
- In Spanish: "ayuda" (help) originates the word "ayudante" (the one learning, the one needing help)
- **Help = support someone that is in the process of learning**
- Related to supporting someone who doesn't have all the tools because they're learning

### Cultural Misconception About Help
**Modern belief:** Asking for help is related to defeat—you should do things by yourself, you have to be successful on your own.

This is a **capitalist spirituality** misconception: we shouldn't ask for help, we can do everything by ourselves, we don't need help.

### Historical Evolution: From Cooperation to Competition

**10,000 Years of Feudalism (Cooperation Era):**
- Humans created with the concept of **tribe/group** because otherwise couldn't survive
- In ancient times, we needed help of others to eat, sleep, be safe, survive in the environment
- Subconscious idea: **we need others to survive**
- Next evolution: live together working to have resources (food, seeds, sowing, art, growing animals)
- **Labor/work idea:** Everyone in the group must do something to help the herd survive
- No one just laid down doing nothing—everyone had to contribute something for the rest
- Families grow → need to secure food/resources from theft/fighting → create organization → feudalism and kingdoms
- **King = administrator** for all people to feel safe
- **Feudal = administrator** ensuring security for countryside workers
- System worked for approximately 10,000 years

**18th Century Industrial Revolution (Shift to Competition):**
- People living in fields → moved to cities to work in factories
- **Countryside to burrows** (cities, from Latin "burrows" = Roman term for cities)
- Workers in 18th century: from poor to rich by accumulating resources through factories
- **Bourgeois concept** started 14th-15th century (people living in cities), but 18th century was the great moment when most countryside people moved to cities

**The Great Shift:**
- **Countryside:** Sowing plants = food every year → "Let's all help ourselves to rise the food so we can eat"
- **Cities:** No sowing plants, no growing animals, **no food** → had to work for money to buy things
- **Help becomes competition:** Whoever works more hours = raises more money = buys more things
- Competition begins even harder than before
- Bourgeois competing with each other: lowering prices, producing with more people, competing to grow companies
- Not natural work of families in cities—the bourgeois became "something wrong" in modern perception

**French Revolution (Late 18th Century):**
- People living together, working 16+ hours like slaves, no food, no resources
- Population starts revolution, taking over the bourgeois
- Question: **How did we lose the idea of helping one another?**

**Countryside vs. Cities:**
- Countryside = lived in communities
- Cities = no food unless you compete and have resources to buy it

**Communism vs. Capitalism Origins:**
- **Communism concept:** Created from countryside communities idea (not just Russia)—all around Europe, wanting to live in communities together
- Russia easier because had AR, Soviets, organization groups already—easier to share the idea
- Countryside started movement of living altogether
- **Capitalism:** "Capital" = head of state, where you control everything
- In the capital/cities, people **had** to compete because no food unless you compete for resources
- Impossible to live like communism in a capital—capitalism was best system for city survival
- Capital created capitalism to grow and have success

**The Great Divide:**
- **Capitalism said:** "Communism not good—communists live in countryside, share everything, can't have more than they already have"
- **In cities:** Compete—whoever works better has more resources
- **Capital vs. Community:** Capital started to be against the community
- **This is how helping one another became a defeat for capitalism**

### Capitalism as Philosophy, Not Economy
- **Capitalism is not about money**
- **Capitalism = philosophy of competition**
- Capitalism is a **philosophy of life**, not just economics
- When capitalism spread around the world as a system, it entered: schools, republics, religion, philosophy—everywhere
- We have capitalism in every system

**Past 200 Years:**
- Living through the idea that **helping others or asking for help = defeat**
- "You have to succeed" or "They have to work for whatever they want" or "I can do everything by myself, I don't need help"

**Modern Divide:**
- **Communist/Socialist:** Willing to help others, even if others don't do anything
- **Capitalist:** Want to succeed, have money, don't care about others, say "You have to work hard for whatever you want"
- **But it's not like this**—what's really happening is **competition is everywhere**
- Even in communism/socialism—because when we all go to school, we **compete** for grades

**Result:** Asking for help is a defeat, even on both sides.

### True Meaning of Help (Redefined)

**NOT Help:**
- Help someone = do everything the other way for them
- Asking for help = ask someone to do what I can't do

**TRUE Help:**
- **Asking for help = asking to learn a new way of doing it**
- **Giving help = teaching someone else how to do it in a way**
- Help means **to teach or to learn**
- When I give help to someone, I teach that person a different view so they know a new tool to **be free** and do it themselves
- When I ask for help, I'm asking to learn something new so I can **do it better the next time** and be free

**Key Principle:** Ask for help is evolution. Ask for help is the future.

### Not About Systems, About Philosophy
- Don't have to go back to communism systems of the past (related to fields, specific situations of that time)
- Today has changed—it's different
- Should not go back to old systems
- **What we have to do:** Resign/transform the **concept** of help, not the system
- **Resign the philosophies of the system**

**Personal Example (Matias):**
- Friends say he's very socialist
- He says: "No, I'm the least socialist of all"
- "I'm a humanist, which is different—maybe socialism has some things there, but I'm neither capitalist"
- We usually want to classify people—but he doesn't care about classifications

## Cosmic Heart Message

**Code: Web**

The echoes created by the resonance of infinite fragilization originate from the cosmic pulses, creating beautiful **interweavings** that design interconnection—like the waves of many drops falling in a calm surface of a lake. All patterns create unique figures.

**United, we call them webs.**

This web remains united between pulses and sounds, making all of them coordinate. The **bond** between the distorted beings remains strong despite the differences.

## Practical Application

**Daily Practice:**
1. **Identify help opportunities** - Notice when someone needs help or when you need help
2. **Ask for help** - Practice asking for help as **asking to learn**, not asking someone to do it for you
3. **Give help as teaching** - When helping others, teach them a new way so they become free to do it themselves
4. **Notice competition conditioning** - Catch yourself in moments of "I have to do this alone to succeed"
5. **Redefine success** - Success is not doing everything alone; success is learning and teaching
6. **Write down helpers** - List people who have helped you (taught you) and people you've helped (taught)

**Integration:**
- Read the full blog for more detail (mentioned in the teaching)
- Use the fire circle meditation when struggling to ask for help or give help
- Practice "I Am the Home of Truth" when facing help situations
- Remember: help is not doing it for them, but teaching them how

**Etymology Practice:**
Understanding word origins helps us grasp what ancient humans were expressing about abstract concepts through physical descriptions. This is why etymology is used extensively—to return to the original, untainted meaning before cultural conditioning.

**Capricorn Emotional Week:**
Help reveals how we **use** emotional links with others. Capricorn question: "What is this help useful for?" True answer: **Help is useful for learning and teaching, creating freedom.** Not useful for creating dependency or proving you can do everything alone.

**Revolutionary Practice:**
Every time you want to "succeed alone," pause and ask: "What could I learn if I asked for help?" Every time someone asks for help, instead of doing it for them, ask: "How can I teach them so they become free?"

**Ask for help = evolution. Ask for help = the future.**
