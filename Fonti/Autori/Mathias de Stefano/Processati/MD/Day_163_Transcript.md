## Introduction

Good afternoon , good evening. Everyone 's ready.

## Energy Work

Today , through Chakra , emotional week , Capricorn Mall.

So , I was just sharing that , , Today , I do n't know how it 's going to be because I 'm really tired. I 've been the whole day doing meetings and organizing things , even for tomorrow and also for the next years. I 've been organizing stuff for , of course , 2002 , and I 've also , for October , 2002 , which is the next one , and I have kind of organized the thing , but I even arrived until 2007.

So , I 've been organizing things for the next decade , mostly.

So , that 's very , very Capricorn Rising , and , , and , , Yesterday 's the , , new moon in Capricorn.

So , I put all that energy on working , which I like. , so I have all my planning , and you are all involved in those things , put them until August , 2007. I really love to organize things. I feel like , I get excited when I organize things.

So , I , , that 's why I organize so many things in a long term , but I 'd learn that everything changed , and I do n't really care. I 'm open to the changes , , but I just love to organize.

So , on the meantime , I will be speaking about what it 's concerned to us.

Today was , , it was , , ah , our day is , there was a sunstorm in the morning , so everything is covered with a little bit of dust , and that 's what you get by living just across the street to the Share Desert. , and one of these days when the weather is straight , I will go outside and make some transmissions on video going around the area in Gia.

So , you can , , know a little bit of the place if you know it , but it has to be fairly.

So , for sure , I would be connected around my , , to Px.

So , that 's , early for some of you.

So , I , I see also that , , many people is writing our writing on the languages , so just , , to say thank you to you , because of this sun-longed item yet it. I do n't know in which languages , at German , there 's people that write me in German , and I do n't understand German.

So , , thank you , if you 're listening to this in English. Thank you , also , I see a lot of people from Romania , , Bulgaria and many other countries that , , are around.

So , , thank you for , for writing for the messages. , yes. In Romanian , I just only know , the word , and they are all the bad ones. First thing that you learn in languages , all with words , so in Romanian , I always see , I only know the bad words.

## Q&A

So , so the topic for today is help , which is something that is so , hard for all of us to ask for.

So , let 's go first , of course , with the etymology. And I will , , I will tell you why I use so much , the etymology , because today topic is help , and for me , etymology is something that really help us to understand many things. And why is that? Because in the , in the ancient times , the first humans , they had no idea how to communicate things that they , that were in their minds.

So , the way in the , in which they used to communicate , the thoughts , the things , the abstract things. Where , about , , where about describing it , the abstract and things that happened in a physical world.

So , when you , when you understand , the origin of the word , even if many times it 's really difficult to go into the very origin , , even if that is difficult , , we can have a kind of an idea of what this really meant for the first humans.

So , we can have a better , , perception and concept of , why I will use in this world today.

## Energy Work

So , through thousands of years , by misspelling , , mispronunciation , by confusion , by different , ways of saying things , the accents , the , the song , all this kind of things , , created like different languages , and , , but they all have kind of , similar root , and it 's all about physical things. Hmm?

So , this is why it 's important to understand this words , , because sometimes they give us an idea , like for example , yes , I , I , I , I , I talk about what is , , purpose.

So , purpose , for it 's so philosophical , so , so , and that you can not really , get how to express what is a purpose.

So , they just , well , is something that is , put a head in front of you.

So , but all , both seem to , per , pose , is the word for something that is put , and that 's how it 's , help , in English , the word , help , comes from that , in the European language , that is , help , and , and , and , help , means to , hold , it comes from the same word , hold , and , help , and , is the same word , hold , and , and , is the same , means pronunciation , which is to hold something.

So , what it means to help , when you are able to , hold , when you are able to , support something , to support something. Support , support , support , comes from the Latin word , to , to , to , to put , above , to , support , support means to , bring , – to bring , for-tari , to bring , and , and , to , and , and , enter , anything you 're thinking about , you already know something , you called an instrument about this word. This word , You originates in English , originates the word youth.

So in Spanish , at youth is to move the one that is learning , to move to the one that needs help. Also to the one that is in need of learning something.

So it 's also related to support someone that does n't have all the tools , because it 's learning.

So help is kind of support someone that is in the process of learning.

## Q&A

So this concept is something really , really conflicting in our societies , because today the concept of help of helping someone or ask for help is related with this cultural idea that you should n't ask for help. You should be able to do the things by yourself. You have to get your own things in your own ways and you have to be successful.

So we have this misconception about what is help.

So today in the blog I wrote a lot about this , so I invite you to read it because it 's much more detail. But I would try to make a summary today about this , about the idea of why the concept of help is more a defeat for our present culture.

Remember that in previous video , we have been explaining about how humans , even if we are individuals , we have been created with the concepts of the tribe of a group , because otherwise in the past , in the ancient times , we would n't be able to survive because we needed the help of others in order to to eat , to sleep , to be quiet , to survive in the world environment.

So this is why even today we have this subconscious idea that we need others in order to survive in our lives. This idea of survival in a group together makes the next step of evolution in our societies , which is to live all together working in order to have resources.

So we all need to work and do something. The idea of work of labor is that in order to have the resources and not talking about money talking about food , seeds , about sewing , about heart , about growing the animals. All these kinds of things , we need to work for it. And in this concept that has created through thousands of years , everyone in the group must do something to help the herd survive.

So there is no one that just was laying down and not doing anything. Everyone had to report , everyone had to do something for the rest.

So remember that after all these plans , all these families starts to grow and have much more resources , in order to administrated all this and for anyone to come and steal for them and have this fight , they create an organization in which they could secure these food and resources.

So they create the feudalism and the kingdoms. King is the administrator , the feudal is the administrator for all these people to feel safe in what they do in the countryside.

So for 10,000 years approximately , this system worked everywhere.

So it was fun. Until around the 18th century , the beginning of the 18th century , we started with the industrial revolution , with the inter-revolution , all the people that used to live in the fields , they go to live in the cities to work in the factories.

So this creates a population of people that used to live in the countryside to the burrows. The burrows are the cities , the Latin people , the Roman people used to call like that , burrows.

So the burrows , burrows , I do n't know how you say it in English , but the burrows people were then those workers in the 18th century that started to become from poor to rich because they accomplished to create a amount of resources by the factories. The concept of the urges started in the 14th century , mainly 14th and 15th century , when all the people started to live in the cities , but here in the 18th century , we 'll be the great moment when most of the people of the countryside go to live in the cities.

So a lot of people started to become burrows.

So from this moment when we left this countryside , there was no food because before we were sewing the plants , we could have the food every year. But now everyone lived in the cities. There was no sewing plants , there was no growing animals , so they had no food. They had to work for money , so that 's why the system of let 's all help ourselves in the countryside to rise the food.

So we can eat every year , so we need to help everyone. In the cities , we became the competition. Whoever works much more hours , rise much more money so you can buy more things.

So the concept of competition begins even harder than it was before. The cities , what started to happen is that the urges started also to compete one another to try to succeed and to have more money to have more success in their own factories.

So they started to lower the prices , they started to produce with much more people. They started to compete to grow their companies.

So it was not about the natural work is that we 're all these people that were working their houses in the city , but that 's how the urges started to become something wrong , something bad in our common days. Before it was good , but then started to be a competition.

So not helping each other society but to compete each other to grow.

Remember that this system was always like this because of the feudalism. The feudalism came from all these thousands of years in this periodical structure , organizing the families.

Now the feudal disappear and it comes to be the urges.

So what happened in this same century is that so many people live together working in so much 16 hours and so on and like slaves and they had no food , they had no resources.

So suddenly they all start a revolution. Here comes the French Revolution.

So we start to do this. The the the population starts to take over the urges. The concept is that how we lost the idea of help one another.

Remember that in the countryside we used to live in communities.

So whoever work communities you can eat you can have food.

Okay , so remember that this concept is from the countryside creating the communion of people.

Okay , so this communities created the idea of communism. It was not only in Russia that started this. It was all around Europe that created this idea to come back to live in communities in the countryside. In the cities you had not food.

So in Russia was easier because they were having the AR still and they had all this Soviets and organization groups and communities along the whole country.

So it was easier to to share this idea.

Okay , so that 's why in the countryside they started to create this movement of living altogether. But in the other side in the urges the capitals. They wanted to be capitals.

So that 's capitalism. The capital is the head of the state is where you control everything.

So that 's why in the capital is where people started to compete because there 's no food unless you compete and has resources to find the food.

So that 's why in the cities capitalists and was the best system because it 's impossible to live like communism in a capital.

Okay , so that 's why the capital started to create this system of capitalism to grow up and to have some seed.

So you can have much more , much more things.

So what happened here?

So what happened is that the capitalism said no , it 's not good to live like communism because the communists are people that live in the country. In the countryside and they actually where they have , but they can have more than they already got because they have to share it. They have to help one another. And in the cities you have to compete whoever works better has more resources.

So that 's why the capital started to be against the community. And this is how the idea of helping one another is kind of the defeat for the capitalism. Let 's think about this. How many of us are in this world competing to one another?

Like for example , how many are like counting if we are doing all good in order to light. How many of us are just trying to see if better than that one or if this one has better things and who is going to arrive to the fifth dimension faster than other ones?

So that 's capitalist spirituality. Because capitalism is not about money. Capitalism is about competition.

So capitalism is philosophy of life. It 's not the economy. It kind of means something different. Capitalism is philosophy.

So this is why in the moment of the capitalism spreading around the world and becoming a system of the whole planet. The capitalism is the schools to the republics , to the religion , philosophy , everywhere.

So we have capitalism in every one of the systems.

So this is how we can understand that in this past 200 years we have been living through the idea that helping others , helping others , or asking for help is a defeat. It 's not good because you have to succeed or you say they have to work for whatever they want. Or we say , I can do everything by myself. I do n't need help.

I can succeed by myself.

So , fully people in this separation , like the communist people or the socialist , are the ones that are willing to help others , even if the others does n't do anything. And in the other side , people say the capitalism are the people that they want just to succeed to have money and they do n't care about the others and they said you have to work hard for whatever you want. And it 's not like this. It 's not like this because what really is happening there is the competition.

And now that is everywhere , it 's in the communism , socialism , whatever. Because when we all go to school , what we are doing is to compete one another and how many numbers we got in the next time.

So , this is why , in all this time , we have created this idea that asking for help is that a feat , even for my side or the other side.

So , in order to accept help and to be able to give help , we do n't have to go back to the ideas of the communism in the past , because those companies in the past were related to the fields.

So , an engine , an all idea of how we had to be according to that specific situation in that time. But today we have changed , it 's different.

So , we should not go back to a system that we 're talking about help. What we have to signify is our concept of help. Not the system. Help.

So , it 's not about to come back to the systems. It 's about to resigning , transform the philosophies of that system. For example , myself , if you ask all my friends for sure , there is a lot of people that say , you can tell that you are very socialist. And I said , no , if you ask my friends , I guess that I 'm the least socialist of all of them.

And then I am not socialist. I do n't have those ideas. I am a humanist , which is different and maybe socialism has some things there. But neither capitalist , because I do n't care.

So , we usually want to classify people.

Now , we come back to the concept of what is help. Help is not to help someone and do everything the other way. Help is not asking for help. It 's not to ask for someone to do what I ca n't do.

Asking for help is to learn a new way of doing it. And given help to someone is teaching someone else how to do it in a way. Help means to teach or to learn. When I give help to someone is to teach that person a different view.

So that other person knows a new tool to be free and do it by himself. If I ask for help is because I am asking to learn something new so I can do it better the next time. And be free. Ask for help is not that the future is evolution.

## Daily Practice Elements

The vibration for today is bad. The statement for today is I am home of the truth. The code for today is web. The echoes created by the resonance of its infinite fragilization or originates from the cosmic pulses created beautiful interwavings that design interconnection like the waves of many drops falling in a calm surface of a lake.

All patterns create unique figures. And unite united we call them webs. This web remained united between pulses and sounds , making all of them to coordinate. And the bounce between the distorted beings remains strong despite the differences.

Let 's go to the line. Every day I see the same thing.

Today I will speak less because I am tired and no. Never shut up. We see it comfortable and we close our eyes. Take a deep breath and focus only in your breathing.

## Guided Meditation

I become aware as I breathe deep. But the environment I am finding myself today. And when I do it I stretch the body sitting comfortable in this space. With my imagination I start imagining that this environment becomes darker.

Under the shadows until you realize that this is the night. And up in the skies you can see this stars. I perceive in front of me a fire. And I can feel it 's light and it 's heat in my face , my chest , on my hands.

I perceive and see the shape of the fire of flames like snakes with all the different tones of orange. Around me , around the fire. On my sides I can see people seated watching the same fire. I recognize that the people around the fire are those who I have helped through my life , consciously , and those who helped me being aware of it.

## Q&A

And in between of them I find others on the wise ones. To whom I have come here , asked for help. I watch the fire , I ask myself , am I able to ask for help? I feel free.

In the light of the fire I recognize the faces of those who I have come here to help. The faces of those who came here to help me. I see the faces of those who I have come here to help me. In my heart I open myself to the liver , this help.

I recognize that this is my family , this is my community , this is my home. I recognize that this is my home. I recognize that this is my home. I recognize that this is my home.

I recognize that this is my home. I recognize that this is my home. I bring all that to my heart with me , this help. This is my family , this is my truth.

I am the home of truth. This truth is the teaching that I receive and the teaching that I give. All of them are the tools that I use and use. Slowly , you start to bring this consciousness all around your body , my young , stretching , to receive help to ask for help.

I feel free when I give my help. I am there , I just write down and find out your answers. Thank you everybody for being there.
