## Overview

Today marks the beginning of the Sagittarius month, where we transition from the shadows and depths of Scorpio into the clarity and consciousness of light. We explore the concept of projection, distortion, and how the universe expresses itself through reflections and perceptions. The teaching connects the allegory of Plato's cave with the spiritual journey of resurrection and rebirth.

## The Nature of Projection and Distortion

The universe expresses itself in waves of vibration that create different energies through polarity. These energies form structures we call matter. Matter is the conjunction of energies, and energy is the distortion of sound. Therefore, matter is the dimension where we experience all distortions.

**Distortion is not something bad** - it is simply a position, a structural organization of reality. It is how the axis bends itself. When we look into a mirror, light reflects back to us, allowing us to see our image. This bending of light creates perception, and every perception allows the divine to see every possibility of itself.

The world of shapes, existing in shadows, is based on distortions. Shadows become guidance in our reality. Throughout thousands of years of existence, we as humans have created networks of shadows and distortions through thoughts, beliefs, religions, and cultures. We feel trapped in this reality, living as slaves to these projected shadows.

## The Allegory of the Cave

Plato's allegory teaches us about our relationship with shadows and light. In the cave, slaves see only shadows projected on walls, believing this is the only reality. When one slave questions this truth and ventures outside to seek the light, they begin a journey of self-knowing.

**Light is not consciousness itself** - light is a path to consciousness. The being who escapes the cave must return to the darkness to bring light to others. This shows that we cannot escape from darkness to reach enlightenment without acknowledging our origin.

Those who try to escape shadows to go straight to light will never find enlightenment. The month of Scorpio was essential because it showed us the darkness we must acknowledge to become aware. We must pay attention to our traumas, our subconscious, all the things hidden in our shadows. Only by working with the subconscious can we bring clarity.

## Resurrection and Reincarnation

The path of Sagittarius begins when we say, "This cannot be the only truth, there must be more." The moment the slave decides to seek outside and look for truth is when the path begins. To find truth, we must allow perceptions to die.

**Resurrection** comes from the Latin "re-surgere-teo," meaning to go back and take what is below into an upright position. What was lying on the ground, buried, now stands up again. This is the concept of keep moving ahead.

Life follows a wave pattern - up and down, life and death, constantly. When we go down into the negative (death), we then stand up into life again (resurrection). This creates the cycle:

- **Incarnation**: Within flesh, entering a physical body
- **Death**: Leaving the physical body
- **Reincarnation**: Re-entering a physical body, resurrecting into life

Resurrection is synonymous with reincarnation because we reincarnate again inside a body in life. But resurrection also happens within one lifetime - through the crises we experience, the falls and rises, the process of dying and being reborn constantly.

## The Process of Learning and Education

Every living being experiences resurrection constantly through the crises we live. We all have moments where we must start over, begin from the very beginning. We live many deaths and rebirths in just one week.

When we acknowledge that we are part of the divine - the divine trying to figure out itself and its many possibilities - we understand that we are divine expressions trying to understand ourselves through this process.

**Life is a journey of recognition** - a journey of learning about myself through life. This process has two aspects:

1. **Learning**: Awakens knowledge
2. **Education**: Awakens wisdom

Both are paths that Sagittarius shows us to reach the light. Light here means clarity - the ability to see things as they really are. The process of learning and education requires us to fall down and stand up again, using trial and error.

## The Crown Chakra and Resurrection

Every time we fall into darkness and crisis, it is simply to take the necessary energy to learn how to turn up and keep going, how to resurrect. In Christianity, resurrection is associated with Jesus Christ, but it is actually a conceptual teaching, not just a historical fact.

Our journey today is to take all the mud we accumulated during Scorpio month and transform the scorpion into the lotus. The lotus can flower in our crown chakra, bringing clarity to the path of life and wisdom.

## Guided Meditation: From Seed to Unity

The meditation guides us from being a seed buried in mud, through the growth process:

1. Starting as a seed beneath the earth, absorbing nutrients from mud
2. Extending roots downward and leaves upward
3. Growing through the branches of the Tree of Life
4. Flowering above the forest, seeing all creation
5. Rising higher to see the savanna, coast, and ocean
6. Ascending through clouds, seeing the entire planet
7. Moving into space, witnessing Earth's light from above
8. Seeing all continents from a cosmic perspective
9. Recognizing that the only dimension possible is **unity**

Through this journey, we understand that all divisions and dimensions are perceptions of one unified reality. We resurrect from shadows into light, recognizing our crown chakra as the illuminated world.

## The Twelve Geometries Begin

With the Sagittarius month, we begin studying the twelve sacred geometries that structure creation. The **tetrahedron** is the first:

- **Four edges, four phases, four vertices** = Twelve perspectives
- Represents **fire** and the **spirit** in its form
- Like a steady flame standing upright
- When multiplied with its complementary opposite, creates the **Merkaba**, the star base of creation

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Ya (representing dimension and the number one - unity)

**Statement:** I am the dimension of unity

**Code:** The tetrahedron - the first of the spirit tools in the creation of its own universe

**Meditation Focus:**
- Visualize yourself as a seed beneath the mud
- Feel the roots growing deep, leaves reaching upward
- Ascend through the forest, above trees, through clouds
- Rise into space and see Earth's light
- Recognize all dimensions as perspectives of unity
- Bring Earth's light sphere to your crown chakra
- Acknowledge the illuminated world within

**Integration:**
Rest and assimilate the vibration for this entire month. Allow the resurrection energy to flow through your crown chakra, bringing clarity to all shadows you've worked through during Scorpio.

**Reflection:** As we begin Sagittarius month, we leave the subconscious shadows of Scorpio and reach toward the conscious clarity of light. We acknowledge that light is not the destination but the path - we must work with our shadows to bring light, not escape from them. Through constant resurrection in our daily lives, we learn and evolve, recognizing ourselves as divine expressions exploring infinite possibilities of the unified consciousness.

Welcome to the light. Welcome to the path of "I see."
