## Introduction

Hello everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. How are you beginning our month of Sagittarius? First of all , remember that we are not doing this month aligned with astrological month , we are working with a conceptual month.

So today we started the month related to the concept I see , which is the aspect of Sagittarius.

## Q&A

So some people asked me where can we still hear the music for the other months and not where but when. And that would be August 2021 , sorry.

So just to let you know about the music , the music is not something to make company to the alignments. Music is something that represents the alignment.

So what She did for the music for all this month is not just to listen it , but to be aligned. That 's why my goal is to have this song , the music constantly and really have them.

So it does n't matter where we connect , when we connect , we can be all same by version. I do n't care if you do n't see me , I care if you hear me.

So it does n't matter if my face is a pixel and a mother.

So today we begin with Sagittarius months.

So we live our shadows behind in the subconscious to reach for the conscious in the clarity of the light.

So let 's remember this that matter is the conjunction structure of energies and the energies comes from vibration.

So the universe expresses itself in waves of vibration that starts to create different energies by polarity and these energies create structures that will be called matter.

So this is the distortion of energy and energy is the distortion of sound.

So matter will be known as the dimension where we experience all the distortions.

So the world of this , the world of matter is made up with different projections.

So this version means that we are just reflections and perceptions of reality , nothing in the matter really exists. There are only perceptions.

So distortion is not something bad , it 's just a position , a structural organization of reality.

So it 's not bad , it 's simply how the axis bends itself.

So it 's another position. That 's all. When we , for example , look ourselves into the mirror , the light reflects in the mirror and goes back to us. This ending of the light allows ourselves to see the image of what we are.

So the distortion , the distortion , the bending of the light towards me , is the one that allows me to perceive a dimension and every perception of myself.

So this is why this is why the torch is something good for the universe because it allows the divine to see every possibility for.

So what this means that the world of shapes are they in shadows , okay , is based on distortions and others.

So shadows will be kind of a guidance in our reality. This is why many of us as humans in this reality live through the distortions , we live at the store type. Also , we live through the shadows , believing that those things are the only true.

So this is why we have created all our existence related to the shadows.

So through thousands of years , thousands of years of existence. But what we have done was kind of like waving these kind of shadows and distortions through thoughts , beliefs , religions , cultures. We all have created like kind of a network where we trapped. That 's why we feel like we are slaves of this reality.

And this is where we start to understand the legacy of the cover of Socrates and Plato. We think by this allegory that we live in a cave where we see the shadows projected , feeling slaves , but also believing that that 's the only reality that we can live.

So we live through the shadows. There 's a moment when when a slaves in the cave says , this kind of be the only truth , there should be much more outside. There should be more things. The truth must be another one.

So this person starts to try to seek for the seek to look for the outside to go into the outside.

So this person , this slave , say , says , okay , I have to go away to go outside to seek for the light. And by looking into the eyes of the truth that is outside the cave , I will put it for the first time.

So what happens? This person starts to walk outside the cave and it starts to , it starts this adventure where it 's to find all the truth by learning step by step in this new path in the outside.

So this person begins to path of self-imnowaging to try to understand that everything is the perception and depending on my wisdom , I can understand the reality , the truth.

So look at this weapon when what happens when this person has done all this path , it comes back to the cave , to talk with its own shadows , with the ones in the shadows. In the shadow , to bring clarity to the darkness , to the shadows inside the cave. If this being has come back , has came back to the cave , what this shows us , that the light is not the consciousness. This means that light is not the consciousness.

Light is a path to consciousness , because the being in order to unconscious has to come back to light to the darkness to bring the light. This is why when people try to escape from the darkness , from the shadow , to go straight to the light , they will never find enlightenment. Because they are the nine , the origin of your path. This is why it was so important , the month of the cave , because Scorpio shows us all the darkness , that we have to acknowledge in order to become aware.

So this person that had escaped from the shadow and darkness to find the light had to come back to the shadows to bring the light. But it would be different if you work with your shadows , and then you go into all of them.

So this is why what we have to do is to pay into all our trauma , our subconscious , all the things that we have within hidden in our shadows. Because we work with all that in subconscious is the only way you can bring clarity. That moment when this slave says this can not be the only truth , there should be much more is when the path of such theories begin. When the person says , I have to go outside and to see the truth , and to look for the truth , and to have fun looking for the truth.

And in order to find those truth , what we have to do is to allow those all perceptions to die. This is why yesterday we had to die , so we today , good , resurrect.

Today I wrote in the blog about resurrection and the meaning of the word which is re supége teo , which means to go back to take what is below into a strike position. That 's what it is , resurrect.

So whatever was laying down the floor was buried in the floor in the ground , now it 's stood up again. This is related to the concept of keep moving ahead. Do you remember what we have? Talk yesterday.

Yesterday we have seen that this is the wave of reality and when it bends , when it starts to compress , it creates the matter.

So from one life we go to another life and then we go to death again and constantly the same.

So this means that someone goes down , falling down in the ground in the negative , and then it 's stood up going up again straight into the life.

So this means here that in the life we have a physical body and then it goes away , it spreads away by death.

So this concept here of creating a life is what we call incarnation. In incarnation comes from the Latin which means within flesh.

So we are here and flesh.

So that 's an incarnation. And then we die and we stop being inside the flesh.

So when I came back to life , I will call this re incarnation.

So the concept of reincarnation is related to getting in in another physical body.

Okay. If I was dead and then I came back into life by reincarnation. This means also from being dead like this , I come back into a straight position in life.

So we also resurrect. The resurrection is another way of calling reincarnation because we reincarnated again inside a body in life.

So there are synonyms.

So remember this here. One life.

So I reincarnated in one life. Resurrection in life.

So now we have this life.

So we reincarnated in a resurrected. But during this life we will leave a whole process. This process that we will leave also have downs and ab. It has moments of crisis , moments.

Stability , moments of chaos , moments of sadness or euphoria. Yes.

So through our life we will also leave this moments of ups and downs.

So the reason why we have this in one life is because we need the process of crisis to. Take strength. And to charge energies so we could create in the next step.

So this is what we normally call. To fill and to stand up again.

So this process of. Going up again after crisis. That we live in our lives. It 's also called resurrection.

Every living being through the crisis that we live. We all experience constantly direction. How many of you here. Have to start all over again.

How many of you have been living in crisis. And you just say , I have to begin. See from the very beginning. Many of us had lived those kind of things.

Many now lives with different people with different situations. And even we can live many of them in just one week.

So all us throughout ours are experiencing constantly. What it means to die and to be reborn. To die and to be reborn constantly. And to that rebirthing we risk direction.

When we acknowledge that we are part of the divine. The divine trying to figure out itself. It 's many possibilities of itself. We will find out that we are just divine expressions.

Trying to understand itself. But this process.

So resurrection is a way in which the divine expressed itself.

So life basically is a journey of recognition. Is a journey of learning about myself through life. And this is why this path towards the light is related to such theories. All this process is called process of learning and process of education.

The process of learning is the one that wakes in that awakened knowledge. The process of education is the one that awakens wisdom. Both of them are the path that such theories will take to show us how to reach the light. Light here is not seen like light.

You see like the concept of clarity. In order to see the things how they really are. The process of learning and education. Needs for us to fall down and to stand up again.

Because it 's the way in which we learn is the way that we call proof and mistake.

## Energy Work

So related to the crown chara today. One to understand we have to acknowledge is that every time that we fall down into the dark into the crisis. It 's just to take the amount of energy necessary. Learn how to turn up and keep going.

How to resurrect.

So of course that in the Christianity. People relate to resurrection only with Jesus Christ. But I wrote about it in the blog so really. But the main thing that I want to.

For you to to have today about this about resurrection is that. Resurrection is something conceptual. It 's not. Specifically a historical fact.

This is why today related to the crown chara. But we. Is to take all the mad that we have. Put in ourselves.

Doing the scorpion. The scorpion. To tourism the lotus.

So the lotus can flour. In our crown chara. And from there bring clarity to the path of life. To the path.

To wisdom.

So. Our journey begins. Information for today. Deliberation for today.

## Daily Practice Elements

Yeah. The statement for today is I am. The dimension of unity.

So the sound. Yeah. Means dimension. And the letter R is number one.

So that 's why dimension of unity. To the be changed. The concepts and we begin with the 12 geometries. The code for today is the tetrahedron.

The first one of the spirit tools in the creation of its own universe. The tetrahedral figure. It has four ages. Four phases and four vertices.

This means 12 perspectives that resume. The cosmos visions related with fire. It 's this spirit for its form. It 's like a steady flame.

My multiplying in its complimentary opposite. Constitute a merriam by base of creation.

So let 's go. To the light. Going out of the darkness. See it comfortable.

And I focus. And breathing. The only thing that I 'm going to do is to. The tips of my fingers with my other fingers.

There is soft. Focus in it in the breathing. Take a deep breath. And remember.

## Energy Work

We are sired from the shadows. To the light. My crown. Is the illuminated world.

I see. Take a deep breath , bring your hands to your chest to the heart. I want you to be the power of resurrection within you. I think it 's a great day.
