## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra:** `Root`

## Introduction

Hi everyone , morning , afternoon , good evening. Everyone fine?

Sorry , I was like doing like this , but it 's just that my feet were like each and too much , so I was taking my socks off. I started to be a little bit more cold , so my skin is not used to be so cold , so that 's why my skin is not used to be a little bit cold , so I was feeling uncomfortable.

## Energy Work

So we are today in the emotional week , in the day of the root chara related to the topic for today which is joy.

Today I do n't want to promise anything , but today I do n't think I 'm going to speak a lot because I have a low energy today , so I do n't think I 'm going to be able to speak a lot , but anyway , as always , I have no idea why I 'm speaking.

So I do n't know how you are.

So talking about joy , an English joy can be also expressed in this concept of feeling joyful for something that happened in the spiritual way you can feel joyful , but the specific concept that we are talking about as in Spanish you may say , Goss. This concept is not much related with the invisible world and what you have inside , but more about the feelings , the sensations that you have with your body , how your body feels like pleasure , feeling this kind of pleasure.

So a better translation of Goss in Spanish for English would be pleasure , okay?

Something like that , a kind of pleasure with joy. Joy comes from the Latin word , Power. It seems that it 's not the same word , but joy comes from joy in French and joy comes from joy that comes from Gore , okay?

So that 's the origin of the word , Gautier , and Gautier means to feel happiness , to feel happiness , to feel full with something that makes you enjoy things.

So it 's like enjoy the fruits of things.

So yesterday we were talking about the version and having fun with the creation that we are supposed to have fun during the process of creation that we have to find the version in the diversity of creation , yes , we spoke about that.

So today is a little bit more deep the concept , which is to enjoy to feel the pleasure on that creation , to be able to feel with all the senses , with planetude , everything that you are creating , your creation itself.

So remember that we have been talking about planetude , about diversion , fun , and now we talk about joy to feel the pleasure.

So remember that to feel the planetude is to fill up yourself with everything within , okay? To feel yourself full with stuff. And then we have the diversion , which is getting fun , which is the process through which the being gets fun creating , and then the joy , the pleasure is about to feel super safe with your senses , everything that you have created.

So this is why the joy is related with pleasure. In our history , as you may say , as you may may see , we have been taught that to feel pleasure , to feel joy in things in this world , is basically the scene is a mistake , because you are just saying , if I am following the truth of God and God is in the heaven , so whatever is in the ground in the earth is the devil.

So I have to leave this world , because this world is just trying to confuse me , it 's just trying to make me feel trapped here , so I can not set myself free , because the freedom is in the heavens , in the skies , and so on.

So because of these many religions , many cultures have created this concept that to enjoy life , that to have fun in life , that to feel pleasure in life is basically a scene. That 's that belief.

So it 's important to understand that when we see the things of the past from our point of view , it 's very different , because sometimes we say , but how they could think that or this or that , I do n't know , but today , we are in a moment , that is really easy , because we have free speech. We can say whatever. We can speak at about anything , as I said , as speaking about spirituality , but I also speak about about pleasure and sex here , YouTube showing the socks , and you know , so we are free. We can do whatever we want , now we can share anything we want.

So in that context , in the time , we have not free speech. We had a different way of seeing things. We had different contexts. We started to organize this context according to that circumstances.

And do n't say , so let 's go to understand that circumstances. It 's important to understand that there was no one in history that was about guy saying , I will control everyone doing the system to repression and so on. No , it was a story of just things that happened in history. Like 2000 years ago , our society , the Roman Empire , the Greek Empire , they started to fall down.

They started to just disappear. In this fall of the empire , a lot of people that were used to the loss of the Roman Empire , and many other empires that started to fall down. All this people just started to leave without a lot.

So it was chaotic. They needed someone to tell them what to do , to make them feel safe. Humans need to feel safe. Because of this , they decided that the religion was the one taking the control because religion had kind of order.

Because of this order that they had in their system , they were able to help a lot of people to feel safe.

So religion to control on the society.

So this was the reason why the religion took so much power because of the falling of this empires.

So religions were created , the main religions were created by the idea that God created us and we made a mistake.

So we were kicked out from the paradise.

So we started to to live in sin. And because before we were able to multiply ourselves by God , now without God , we needed to reproduce like we do now with humans , like humans , like animals , by sex.

So humans started to live in sin by looking in the pleasures of the nature.

So the religion said , no , we have to keep going with the law and we have to do it right as God said. And because the empires have fallen , so the people started to feel safe on the loss of the religion.

Okay , so the past 2,000 years , we have been living in this concept of religion.

Okay , that we 're the answer to a social political care of that time.

So this is why we have to understand that the circumstances of how these thinking begin are not the same as we have today. And so these religions thought in order to come back again to God to the paradise , we should stop doing natural things and we have to go up to the skies. That 's the concept , okay , that they said , so that 's why these said pleasures are a sin.

So these thoughts that we are sharing from the last 2,000 years were not like this always , constantly before the other cultures before these main religions , they were totally different. They said , we are nature and we are created by the divine.

So we are here being living expressions of the Creator.

So this is why our body is an energetic call aspect to feel the divine , it 's a vehicle of the divine.

So we need to understand how to feel the divine within this fire of the spiritual.

So they understood that each one of the charts is a way to feel this divinity. And one of those charts is in the genitals.

So it 's related to the sexuality.

So this is why in the past before 23,000 years ago , they until 12,000 years ago , they were teaching teaching the people how to manage the pleasure within our bodies , how to manage the energy that moves through our bodies in order to feel the divine within and expressing through our skins.

So this was before , but in the last 3,000 years , the monotistic religions started to create this idea if we are going to the heavens , that 's sorry , that we are here in this planet because we were punished by God because of our sins.

So everything that we have to do here is to go again to God 's house because if we stay here , feeling the pleasures , the sensations , the feelings of this world , we can get confused by the devil.

So this image that we have has only 3,000 years old.

So this is why from the very ancient point of view what we had is this idea that we need to suffer. This idea that in order to show to God that we are not following the path of the devil , we have to suffer this reality.

So if you suffer the reality , you 're just a good son or daughter of God that you are showing by your example , I am doing a hard work suffering to eat the woman has to suffer in order to have kids because you have to suffer when you have sex , all these things.

So you are able to show the God that you are not following the path of Satan.

So this is what happened that in the last 3,000 years we had created this idea that everything that brings me pleasure is bad , is a sin. It 's taking me away from God.

So here is this paradox of the religion that if God created everything , so God also created the pleasure , also created this world and he put us in this world , creating everything that happens.

So that 's weird why he would do this.

So when I was talking with this person from the Islam in the pyramid , he said , well this is the great test that we have to go through. And I said , but why? Why a test? Why he would make us go through a test if so he created the test.

I said , so if he created the test , so he hired the devil to create all this.

So the devil is the employee of God , creating all this just to make a test.

So that 's weird. And then he says , no , you should n't follow that guy because it 's the bad guy , but he hired him to do all this.

So well anyway , the thing is that this is a test.

So clearly the great test that we are leaving is not to get lost and to find the balance in all this creation. But the truth is that we have never been so disconnected. Like since the time we have been disconnected from the joy from the pleasure. The energy of the related to pleasure to joy is the root chara.

And the root chara is the one that connects the seed of the masculine with the seed of the feminine together. And also is the chara through where a baby is born.

So the center of the root chara is the center that gives life. And the way in which the spirit feels life is through ecstasy , which in a physical way we call orgasm. And this feeling of joy in the physical body of ecstasy is not related with sex. It 's not necessary to be with other one.

It 's not necessary to do this just for reproduction. It 's about feeling. It 's about receiving the pleasure.

So remember that the center where all the energy of the body of the spiritual body grows up is from the root chara is the one that we call Kundalini.

So one of the biggest things that history has taken away from us , taking away the power of our own creation is because they took away the ability to have pleasure to enjoy. And this is a construction that we all have done by culture.

So now pay attention to this. That in the last few decades we took the freedom back.

So that 's why people is being able to do whatever. Because we have freedom. But there 's one thing that we do n't have , which is power. We have gain back freedom , but we have no power.

And in order to be really free from within , what we need is to empower ourselves again. Through spirituality , religion , society , culture , we all have built this idea that took the power from us , that took the freedom from us. And now suddenly we gained back freedom. But it 's been a long time without acknowledging what it is to have power.

This is why we have no power of our own body. That 's why we are a friend of its press and experiencing our pleasure , our own pleasure. And this is why we give our power to others.

So we have been living two thousand years in which we have created the idea experience the idea that in order to reach the divine we must do sacrifice. And sacrifice comes from the Latin word , the office , the job of the holy.

So that 's why sacrifice was the clue for this two thousand years. But next week we start a new two thousand years. And this new time the way you connect with the divine is by joy , pleasure , freedom and power. The vibration for today is raw.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the legacy of the divine father. The code for today is the color green. The vibrational wavelengths that radiate spirit light. In its way towards ascension , finds its middle point in green.

A color of balance and equilibrium related to the hard chara. The middle point in our being , in nature , chlorophyll absorbs the energy corresponding to the form to the color red and blue wavelengths. Reflecting the green wavelengths. That 's what makes us see plants in this color.

It 's related with the healing based on the potentials of the plants.

## Guided Meditation

Sorry for my English today. I 'm really tired. Let 's go to the element. Sit comfortably and breathe deep.

I remember that I find myself in this village , celebrating with the people about this connection between the heavens and the earth. It calls me father and the mother earth. I see the fire in the center and women around the fire dancing in the circle. Behind the women another circle of men dancing in the opposite direction.

Some to the right some to the left. I go from behind and find a pregnant woman who found us. I 'm from the fire and I put my rice from her shoulders. The company here to see it.

Everything needs on the floor. Watching staring at the light of the fire. Take you to the ground and feel how you become this woman. You recognize that you are now this woman pregnant expecting a time staring in the fire.

As you can raise the body up and down , take deep breath. Each time harder is stronger. I see a knowledge that you are beginning to give birth. As you breathe each time harder deep breath.

Try to remember all the pleasures that you have felt the most intense ones. Since the viewer time playing with your friends , laughing , eating , sharing with your family. And also the biggest pleasures that you have given to yourself to life is those you have felt with others. My sex will remember , try to remember the biggest and strongest.
