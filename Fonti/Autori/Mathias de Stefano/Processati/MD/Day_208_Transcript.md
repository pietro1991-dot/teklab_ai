## Introduction

Sorry that I had begin like this but anyway good morning good afternoon good evening everyone without any mask and nothing I would just say I 'm really tired really tired so today we 're going to need a lot of this patience let 's go to the heaviest part which are needs and needs so let 's go to the topic for today which is Saturn okay so first of all Saturn is the sixth planet of the solar system and until the 1800s when Trans was discovered for all the cultures of the world this was the last planet the last one on the solar system so it was the last spot before we started with the spiritual realm with expansion of the spiritual realm to understand why Saturn , why the people name this planet Saturn we have to remember that usually we relate Saturn the Roman god with the attributes of chrono which is the Greek god but even if for many people is the same god in different cultures they are not so what we are going to do is to try to understand what attributes have taken Saturn from chrono so we can understand why we put both concepts together as one so let 's go to this which is very white so first of all as always let 's go into the etymology of these two names so first of all for Greece this god was chrono chrono means time so he 's the god of time so everything that you have with the name chrono like chronicles for example chronic chronometer all this names chronology all this names that that we used to talk about time we used the name chrono hmm so remember that for the ancient ones gods were not physical aspects outside creating things we 're concepts that unified different things like for example if we are talking about past , present , future they call that the divinity of time so chrono is not a being is a concept that unified the time okay so now let 's see this story so chrono is the sign of the sky and the earth the sky is called Trans and the earth is called gear so Trans and gear the sky and the earth have one child that is chrono it has many other other types but mainly chrono which is the time so when the heavens and the earth go together the time to start to run okay and the running of time well I did n't say this in Spanish but the running of time the movement of the things that transform everything was called ria ria that means the one that moves the one that floats the flow of time through space the one that moves the space okay for sure you have sorry because of this example but for sure you have the name of ria in der ria sorry but der ria is to flow a lot basically that 's the name to flow beyond the limits I will keep with the story now but so the story is that chrono starts to develop its life in between heaven and earth but heaven has a lot of ideas that the time could in manifest so he decides to kill the sky to transcend the sky and control the reality so through that the Trans dies and gives birth to afrodita and afrodita starts to create life the beauty of life so through chrono life evolves transforms itself it starts to create all the things but what happened then what happened is that that everyone was eternal everyone could leave forever so chrono realize that maybe someday one of its children would be also the killer of himself as he was for his death so before someone would kill him he started to kill everyone so he started to eat everyone so that 's why chrono ate his sons and daughters but this is an analogy it 's not real it 's not something related with something that happened with the aliens or anyone that came from skies it 's not any real story it 's just an interpretation of how time is eating everything is destroying everything that exists okay this is the idea of how time dissolves everything that also creates my evolution but there is one of the sons of chrono that comes and kills his father who is him News News is the one that is able to kill chrono and set everyone free how because News is delight is a lightning god so that means they 're awareness the consciousness okay that 's the enlightenment and this is why News can transcend time because when you become aware when you become conscious you transcend time you can go beyond okay so this is a story it 's not something that really happened our concepts okay so remember there are concepts there are not real stories okay they are away in which they could explain difficult things because in that time we did n't have to see they did n't have Marvel no cinema so they had this stories okay okay so you get chrono here so Saturn comes from the adjective Saturn that comes from the verb satire that means this far satisfaction you see the origin of the word sat sat sat sat sat sat sat Saturn Saturn means they want that is satisfied the one that is satisfied so what is Saturn and why it exists well this is an atruscan word that is saying is talking about what happened after you were the fields remember yesterday we spoke about Mars the god adds that was taking care of the fields okay so once you were the fields once you did everything you had to do working hard in the fields in the farms with the animals with the plants and everything you start to make the products of all that so you made the manufacture of of all the elements that you were working with and suddenly comes the time that you have to take benefit of everything that you have done all the work of the year now it has it 's gifts for everyone so you are able to enjoy to celebrate everything you had accomplished so it 's because of this that they started to share the products that they started to eat everything to drink everything to get drunk to get full to to share to give gifts to everyone make some presence because they have so much and they celebrate for many days because they were happy because they did all that with it by themselves and themselves so they ended satisfied because of their work because of the things that they accomplished with the work they were satisfied and they had to celebrate that moment so the Romans used to call those days of celebration Saturnaria Saturnaria was the time in which the people used to celebrate all the things that they had accomplished everything that they done all the effort that they put on life they found it here in this moment when they share and celebrate together so this Saturnaria was not just one day this was like a whole month it was a whole celebration because the families got together and that time they needed to get to be together so they from the mountains , from the fields everywhere and they got together to share everything that they have done so it was like a kind of a month of celebration and now when the Saturnaria ended it ended December 21st why because it 's the Solstice the Solstice from the point of view of the north and hemisphere the Solstice of winter is the day of the longest night so it means that the sun is the southern as it could go okay and for three days it stays there during the night in the shadows and in between the 24 and the 25th December the sun starts to go back come back to the north starts to move again to the longest days announcing that it 's coming this spring in the future so the 24-25th December is what the Romans call Sol Invites which means the sun has been victorious over the darkness the sun was in pictus and it comes back to the longest days so this was the moment of the end of Saturnaria which means now is the beginning of the new year okay so these traditions Saturnaria and Sol Invites Saturnaria is a tradition from Italy from the True Camp people and this and from the Mediterranean cultures they celebrated the Solstice in Sol Invites so the Romans took these two celebrations and they spread it in the Roman Empire throughout all Europe and Europe created the countries that then will colonize the whole entire world bringing these two traditions with the name of Christmas so this is why we celebrate Christmas this is why in Christmas we get together we give ourselves gifts presents we they create our houses we put the family together to celebrate all together we eat as much as we can to say all we are full because we have to celebrate all the all the things that we accomplished in our year so we are not celebrating Christ we are celebrating Saturn and we celebrate that on December 25th because it is three days after the Solstice so it is Sol Invites so we celebrate that because of the Solstice after three days of darkness so what happened then the Christians they just came and put Christian philosophy into this stories into these traditions they did n't change anything they just put the image of Jesus Christ here and that 's it okay so next time do you celebrate Christmas do n't think that you are celebrating something from Christianity you are basically celebrating everything that you have accomplished in that year with all the loved ones and that the sun is moving again towards the north so what is the relationship between Saturn and Chrome is not the same God it means that Saturn is the one that that celebrates that we had accomplished one year so we can begin a new one and that 's why we relate the concept of Chrome because you celebrate Saturnalia when something ends so something you can begin a cycle ends for a new one so important thing about these celebrations to know these celebrations today is that these things are happening right now even if the traditions have shaped this into different cultures different traditions different religions or whatever the idea in which they are based on are the same which means that they are celebrating things that are normal I mean sources and epigenoses will happen always they never ended it 's something that it was n't from the ancient times it 's happening now okay the gathering with the people with the family to celebrate all their accomplishments all the things that we had accomplished in our year we do that also at the end of the year because the year ends and there 's a calendar there 's a moon there 's a sun and you can see it and there 's the time okay so so it 's not an old tradition it 's something that is happening now if we follow any religion any tradition but knowing that these celebrations are because of things that are happening actually today this helps us to leave much more in the present here and now so now going to the psychological aspect of this during 11 months of the year we have been doing many things working going around doing things achieving goals knowing people many things we travel we do many things around and during the last month there is something inside of each one of us that even if we do n't believe in the traditions of the end of the year most of the people feel this pressure inside to make a balance to think about what have we accomplished in that year and you see it with the beloved ones and with the new friends that you did with the family and you start to speak about the stories that happens to you that year you start to share about all the goals that you commit in that year you share you bring some gifts from the trips and stories to tell to everybody you start to share with the loved ones about how was this time so it 's because of this the last month of the year we start to think about what we have accomplished and I was able to do everything that I was supposed to or should I plan and make a new programming for the next year so during that moment of the year we do a clarification for the next year I want to do this I want to accomplish that and you make like a summary of the whole year that have passed so during that month the person is doing like a review of all the wealth in the physical emotional and mental aspects that you have earned that we have earned along the year then we have accomplished within for sure to many of you had happened that even if it 's very silly to celebrate a new year because it 's impossible to say exactly okay this day at this exactly time is the new year because we are on a cycle constantly but we divide it time in that way even though even if it is kind of silly we inside feel like this pressure of saying I am changing one year everything 's changing for me do I have all the tools I need to face a new cycle what have I hardest for myself for my own in the past cycle in the past year what should I do hmm so this thought of I have to start a new path a new a new year was was given to the last planet of the solar system for them the time so this planet was the one representing the judge of the time the one that says what have you accomplished at the end of this time what have you accomplished because that planet is the is the last one they thought it was the last one so that planet is the one that says you accomplished to reach to the last spot so what have you accomplished so that 's why they call this planet Saturn because it 's the judge is the judge that says what to what the show see what have you accomplished what have you earned so Saturn is the planet of revision is the planet of the karma remember that yesterday I explained about the three bodies in our solar system so we have the physical body in the four main planets around the sun the one that are made of rocks then we have the emotional or the soul which is Jupiter and Saturn and then we have the spiritual which is the last two gas planets so if we get this we will remember that when you when you as an individual I accomplished to get out of the physical to transcend the idea of the ego of the self you start to find the purpose of your soul so when you reach Saturn the energy of Saturn is the one saying who are you working for is this what you are doing for your own individual soul because remember there 's no one divided soul your soul is spread along the time in the past in the present and the future connected to your old general logical tree so it 's not an individual soul is a soul spread around what Saturn says to us is that we have to make a review of everything that happened to us in the past past lives trauma all information that is connected to our soul to review the past the karma all the things that we had accomplished the tools that we got during the experimentation of the existence why 'd have be accomplished through time so that 's why we have to make a review of our entire history that Saturn so Saturn is the one saying be patients we have time you will find a way in which you will be able to do this understanding there 's no methods to do this you will find your own do n't worry but it will happen there 's no rush and something important regarding Saturn when I say there 's no rush what I mean is do n't be pressed by others that has already the answers and why is this because that guy that is still with the mind in Mars fighting to accomplish goals every day to to accomplish to survive in the earth okay it 's living that reality as the most important thing because it 's living that is experiencing that so sometimes comes prep from a Neptune mind that says hey what you 're doing is a dream nothing really matters what you are doing because we are an ocean we are all one reflecting each other so there 's no need to find there 's no purpose there 's no blah blah blah blah that 's the Neptune mind but for the person that is still with the mind in Mars that thought is not helpful that idea is not helpful unless you 're looking for it so what I mean about not being in rush is that eventually everyone will get into everyone of the point of views but we can not try to leave far farther and faster according to the process of others or following the process of others that are already in Neptune saying all these things pushing the others that are still in the earth greeting things in Mars fighting for the daily dive pushing them to the spiritual world just the yourself and try to concentrate in what you are trying to do now and eventually if you do it right you will get into the other ones and I say this regarding Saturn because Saturn is a personal review is the inner concepts that says what have you accomplished is not a comic there 's not a comic gathering outside that says you have done fine so you win you have done in wrong so you 're out it 's not something like this Saturn is an inner process that we have to review for ourselves according to our process so when we listen to people that says for example that gives canada let gives their point of view saying you have to do this or that and so on in order to accomplish this or that from that point of view it 's okay as a tool you can get it you can have this information but do n't despair to try to leave like that if naturally your life did n't give you the tools to do it okay so there 's no rush in the inner process okay and remember also this planet Saturn is saying no rush but no stop and why what is this this means that not having a rush it does n't mean that you should n't do stuff we have to act we have to do stuff physically emotionally mentally we have to take action in stuff during 11 months of our year we have many things to do so we can make a review in the last one and to think about what can we improve for the next cycle so it 's not about okay I will stay and maybe someday we 'll come to tools that I need in order to evolve no Saturn is the one that says you 're not going to evolve if you do n't do a stop you have to do okay you have to do in order to know what have you earned okay let 's go to the information for today the vibration for today is do the statement for today is I am the balance of the path the code for today is eternity the three times do n't work in a line but organically and in the same instant in different Tuning or frequencies for that the temporal universe is better and the stood as the song that has rhythm the past melody present and harmony future the song the final product that combines the three of them is called eternity this means the temporal concept of what we specially call item let 's go to the element sit comfortable close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing it'sDoClyCoo in To begin with , we start to become aware of each part of our bodies , to raise them down , stretching and warning. Take a deep breath and become aware of the body that you are in the room , the house. Become aware of the village , the seating where you are , the country , the continent , and even the planet where you are. I take a deep breath and I set the intention to inhabit here and now fully this body.

I take a deep breath and I expand my body and become this room. I take a deep breath and become the village , the town. I take a deep breath and expand myself on the continent. I take a deep breath and expand myself on the continent.

I am the earth and in front of me I can see the light of the sun surrounding me with its heat. I take a deep breath and I observe Mercury Venus and Mars. I see the asteroid belt around us , the vibrant from Jupiter and Saturn and farther away the universe. I am the solar system.

I take a deep breath and become this planet. I observe Saturn with its rings and I extend my arms to wrap the planet with my hands and I break it towards me. I put it in between my legs , seeing how it rings touch both the front of my knees. I contemplate the thousands of rings , made of trillion of pieces of ice and from above I can see the planet with its north bow with a shape of a hexagonal.

I take a deep breath and recognize that Saturn is a place where all my paths head to the library of my soul. All the ways of my past goes to it , my past of the present and the past towards my future. All of them are connected to this world. I recognize in the gravity of Saturn all the things that I had accomplished , all the things that I earned in my experience in my life.

I can find there all the things that I still need to get in the future. Each ice rock is a memory , each ring is a path. I take a deep breath , setting the intention to activate my planet. All those things that I had accomplished , all the wealth , the tools that are within my body , my soul and spirit.

I set the intention to unify all of them in the years , so I can give my next step in balance. I take a deep breath with my hands , I 've dreamed all this information as a source of information as a Saturn towards both of my needs. Activating the memory , my path. I am the balance of the path.

I am the balance of the path. With my hands , I start to bring this consciousness from me to all my body , carry it in , stretching and warning.
