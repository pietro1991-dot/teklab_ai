# Day 97 - Venom: When Love Becomes Poison

## Daily Practice Elements

**Vibration**: NEW  
**Statement**: "I am the expansion of the universe"  
**Chakra**: Root Chakra  
**Law**: Law of the First Dimension - The first dimension is projected from the mental concept of unity. This is the dimension of the vortex or dot, where all forces converge, where is the void itself, neutrality. The first dimension goes through all, for all originates from it, and doesn't have a fixed point but inhabits in all things. Where our quantum reality moves and focuses all forces. That's one.

## Overview

Venom and love are the same word at their origin. The word "venom" comes from the Indo-European language "vhen," which means love. This seems impossible until you understand the process: love is the main energy that creates all other energies, all other emotions, allowing them to manifest. Love comes down from the spiritual world, dividing itself into many different energies and emotions that need to manifest in the roots of the planet—in our root chakra. From there, we unite all the different emotions the spirit used to manifest in this reality, what we call reproduction. This is why all this love and all these energies, when they find themselves in the root chakra, create the Kundalini energy—the energy that starts to flow upward, reconnecting us with unconditional love.

But here's the transformation: when you live plainly in consciousness, you use all the potential you have inside and apply it in your life—that's living in love. When you live through the unconscious, instead of giving your potential to activate the world outside, you try to accumulate things from the outside inward because you feel you must survive and protect yourself. When you protect yourself and close yourself off, your inner tools get no use. And when a tool is not used, it gets rusty. When a tool gets rusty, it becomes toxic. The same tool you were supposed to use with love turns out to be venom. This happens in two ways: ignorance (not knowing how to use the tool) and protection (using the tool to protect yourself from the world instead of for the world).

Spiders, snakes, and scorpions have venom not because they are the "bad guys" of nature—they have venom because they are weak. They are so weak that they had no other way to protect themselves than to take the potential they have within and create a venom to protect themselves from their weakness. Venom is born from the concept of love that makes you feel weak. The same love that creates your life, when it shows your weakness, creates your own venom. This is why in ancient cultures, when a person stopped love and started to feel controlled by others or to control others, when you live from the root chakra with sexuality without allowing the energy to flow to consciousness, the love of creation becomes venom.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology of Venom: From Love to Poison

The word "venom" comes from the Indo-European language "vhen," which means love. To understand how love became venom, we must remember what love is. Love comes from meaning passion, the drive to do something. This passion is the origin of all other actions, all other energies to manifest. Love is the main energy that creates all the others. In ancient languages, love means eternity—the eternal energy that helps the other emotions to exist, that allows all other emotions to exist. All the other energies manifest from love.

From the spiritual world, love divides itself into so many different energies and emotions that they need to manifest themselves in the roots of a planet. That is our root chakra. From there, we unite all the different emotions, all the different things that the spirit used to manifest and create in this reality—what we call reproduction. This is why all this love and all these energies, when they find themselves in the root chakra, create the Kundalini energy, which is the energy that starts to flow upward, to move up, so we reconnect again with unconditional love. But first, we have to go through all this process.

### Love Divided: Coming Down and Going Up

The energy of love creates all the rest of the energies, the other emotions, to be able to be downloaded in the root chakra, in the genitals. From the genitals, the same love is searching itself unconditionally, going up through the being. Here we have this concept: love coming down to our body and going up through our bodies. Coming down, it divides itself to experience itself. Going up, it unifies itself. This love, when it comes down to the root chakra, starts to divide in different layers that we call different emotions.

The emotions are the tools that help you do your stuff in life—they're useful. These emotions, in order to be something real and useful in life, have to be felt by the five senses. That's why we call them "feelings" because you can feel through the different five senses the reactions from the outside in the inside. When we live plainly in consciousness, we live through love because we act and we use all the potential that we have inside—we apply it in our lives. That's living in love.

### The Unconscious Path: How Love Becomes Venom

In the opposite side, we have a life lived by the unconscious. To live through the unconscious brings us to an idea of life which is: instead of giving the potential that you have within to activate the potential outside, it would be to try to accumulate things from the outside toward inside because you know you are going to be safe, you need to survive. So you start to protect yourself. When you protect yourself from whatever problems are outside, whatever problems you are facing, you will have no idea how to use your inner tools. So you close yourself to protect yourself and not to use those tools.

When I live through love in consciousness, I know how to use my potential, to activate my potential, and to use the tools of my potential. But as in every work, if you don't use your tools, if you live through the unconscious trying to protect yourself from the outside, your tools will get rust. They will start to be rusty, and suddenly you won't be able to use them anymore. When a tool is not used and gets rust, the tool starts to be toxic. By being toxic, it begins to be a venom. So the same tool that I was using with love turns out to be venom.

### Two Ways Venom Is Created

This happens because of two different things, two different ways:

**First: Ignorance** - Not having any idea how to use that tool, so it gets rusty. I don't know how to use it, and I don't want to use it, so it becomes toxic, it becomes venom because I'm not using it, I don't know how to use it.

**Second: Protection** - You have this tool to activate your potential, but if you start to think that you have to protect yourself from the outer world, you will use the same tool to protect yourself. Basically, you stop using it for the world and start using it to protect yourself from the world. That's how it becomes also venom.

### The Example of Spiders, Snakes, and Scorpions

We have the example of spiders, snakes, and scorpions that have venom and protect themselves with the venom. But they don't have venom because they were the "bad guys" of nature, because they are bad people or whatever. It basically happens because they are weak. They are so weak that they had no other way to protect themselves than taking the potential they have within and creating a venom so they could protect themselves from their weakness.

Here we can understand how venom is being created. It's not because I have the potential to create venom. No, it's because of the weakness. Because you feel weak, because you are not able to protect yourself, that's the reason why you create a venom. Basically, venom is born from the concept of love that makes me feel weak. So the same love that creates your life, when it shows your weakness, creates your own venom.

### In Ancient Cultures: Love Becomes Venom

This is why in the past, in the ancient cultures, they understood that love was all the creation. When a person stopped the love and they started to feel controlled by others, they started to control others. When you start to live from the root chakra with sexuality and you don't allow the energy to flow to the consciousness to be someone that manifests instead of just living by their passions—that's how the love of the creation becomes venom. That's how when the word of love becomes venom, which is "vhen" to venom.

### Venom in Our Daily Life

What's the use of all this in our daily life? Well, basically, we all are living with venom within ourselves. We all have some kind of venom. And this venom was created because of hunger, rage, control, manipulation, and so many emotions. All of them are born from a conflict with love—because maybe I had a lack of love, or I don't know how to express love, something related with love of my life, with living with love that maybe was just closed and I couldn't feel it anymore. So suddenly, when I was feeling, that love becomes my poison, my venom.

All these conflicts are born from our weakness. When we feel weak, something that we lost, something that we don't feel properly, what we start to do is to take one of the emotions from inside and create it as a tool to protect me due to this weakness. So I create my own venom from that. Just as an example: a person that hasn't received a lot of love during its life will, for sure, have the tendency to eat a lot of sugar. Because in our body, sugar is the sweetness, so we interpret this sweetness with love. Just as an example, that would be like that. Sugar is a poison, is a venom for our body, but the venom is not specifically the sugar—it's my weakness of love, it's my weakness that is the real poison.

### Scorpio People and Seeing Weakness

This is one of the main reasons why most people don't want to know anything about scorpion people. Whoever has a lot of Scorpio in their energy is used to seeing all the weakness of their own personality, used to going to the dark side of their soul and to see their own weakness and to see the weakness in others. They have no problem to say, "Oh yeah, this is my weakness, this is my problem, but this is yours and yours and yours." For the rest of the signs, it's like, "No, I don't want to know anything. No, no, no, this is like death, no."

Most of the people don't want to face their darkness and have these problems once and again because for most people, it's like, "I want the light, I just want to work and do my things and on and on." But nobody's like watching their darkness like Scorpio does—like, "You need to watch within the deeper darkness to heal." So they're just repeating the same thing once again. You have to go and look for your own venoms.

Sometimes, in order to become a beautiful flower, you have to crawl on shit. That's the laughter of a Scorpio one, watching how everyone is trying to find their own balance, scrolling and crawling in the ground.

### The Snake Master's Message: We Are All Reptiles

Yesterday, the Snake Master channeled a message. He said that we humans are from the animal kingdom, and we have evolved in this world through the animal way, which is by survival—through eating, sleeping, feeling safe, reproduction. These main basic emotions are the ones trying to help us stay alive. That's the animal way. All this information is ruled by the reptilian brain, which is the inner brain we have, the oldest one, the deepest part of our brain. We call it the reptilian brain.

We live basically like animals, even if we now can think. What he said is: humans are the ones ruling your life through the reptilian brain, so you are the reptilians. If you want to take control of the world, be responsible and stop living through that reptilian brain. Stop blaming others because those others are taking care of the world until you are responsible enough to do it by yourself. The message of this being is about responsibility, to take action, to take part in it.

He said: "Don't blame us of your own weakness. We are just to show them into your face, and we will rule the world until you get the courage to do it by yourself. To be free requires responsibility, true responsibility, and we will smile with you, for we all are God's wish and need—we find each other. We embrace you on this. You want to, otherwise, see you in your dreams."

### Venom as Overdose of Love

The Snake Master also said: "You are the venom, the poison of the world." Venom comes from the word love, so its origin means love. Basically, venom is love that has been given in mistaken doses—you're not giving the love in the proper doses, so it's a toxic dose. It's toxic when you have more than you're supposed to or less than you're supposed to—it's a really bad administration of your love that becomes venom. The same way in which a good thing in different doses can become venom in biology, something toxic, love also can be toxic. An overdose of love is also toxic. That's why he said you are the venom of this world. Until you are not coherent, responsible, you will be that venom, because you are love.

This is why when we hear this phrase, "I am all love, it's all love with me," maybe you are being toxic. You have to be aware of that.

## Practice

The meditation today takes you to the core of the Earth to discover your venom—the tools that have become poison—so you can transform venom back into love.

**Preparation**: Sit comfortable. Begin to move your shoulders in circles to relax tension. Let all the weight fall down, and by taking a deep breath, focus only on your breathing. Perceive all the light around you getting into your body through the skin, filling up all your inner self. Feel the light shining out and inside yourself, for you are the light.

**Descent of the I Am**: You are I Am, the higher self. Your own higher self shines above your head and gets inside your body, bringing awareness. Take a deep breath and go within your body through the crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacrum, root, knees, ankles.

**Setting the Intention**: I desire to transform my venom into love. I desire to make all of my crisis a conscious transformation.

**Journey to the Core**: Take a deep breath and jump toward the core of the planet through the crust, through roots, soil, and rocks. Feel the heat of the magma, going faster toward the pressure of the iron core of the Earth.

**Finding the Venom**: In the core, under the pressure of the world, in the core of your soul and being, you find your weakness, your venom. Take a look and ask yourself: What is my biggest venom in life? Set the intention, the desire, that your subconscious show you your venom so you can be aware of it and transform it into love by bringing it to the heart.

**Vibration**: From the core, vibrate the sound **NEW** repeatedly.

**Statement**: Repeat: "I am the expansion of the universe. I am the expansion of the universe. I am the expansion of the universe."

**The Snake Master's Presence**: Feel the Snake Master energy speaking:

*"You are the venom. And you will be. You are all venom. I want to start with you, ask you to eat your darkness from within. Blame the darkness from outside. Now is the time. Just stop. Make us guilty from your own violence. Now you see that all this time you have been your own reptiles. I am sorry to let you know this, but you are. This makes sense. We, there we are, reptiles, and we are only your brothers and sisters. We are here yet to remind you that in the shadows there are fears, the only ones that can show you how to change your skin. Until that moment, you are not—we will recognize. There you are, you will not become the eye of it. Don't blame us of your own weakness. We are just to show them into your face, and we will rule the world until you get the courage to do it by yourself. To be free requires responsibility, true responsibility, and we will smile with you, for we all are God's wish and need—we find each other. We embrace you on this. You want to, otherwise, see you in your dreams."*

**Return**: Take a deep breath. Bring all this consciousness through your body, shaking and stretching your body. Bring awareness to each part. Open your eyes when ready.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Tonight before sleep, ask your subconscious: "What are my venoms in life? What tools have I stopped using out of fear or protection?" When you discover your venoms, you discover your weaknesses. When you discover your weaknesses, you understand what tools you lost in your life. Write down whatever arises. The image for today is the scorpion that stings its own neck so it can feel the poison, the venom of its own soul. That's the work—finding where it hurts, where the venom lives.

### Applying the Wisdom

Throughout your day, notice when you are using your emotions and energies to protect yourself from the world (creating venom) versus using them to activate potential in the world (expressing love). When you feel defensive, controlling, or like you're accumulating rather than giving, pause and ask: "What weakness am I protecting? What tool have I let rust?" The answer reveals your venom. Once you see the venom clearly, you can begin to transform it back into love by using the tool for its original purpose—not protection, but creation.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: How can venom and love be the same thing?**  
A: Venom comes from the Indo-European word "vhen," which means love. Love is the main energy that creates all other emotions. When love comes down from spirit, it divides into many emotions that manifest in the root chakra. If you live in consciousness, you use these energies to activate the world—that's love. But if you live unconsciously, protecting yourself from the outside, you stop using your inner tools. When a tool is not used, it gets rusty, and rusty tools become toxic. The same tool you were supposed to use with love becomes venom. That's how love becomes poison.

**Q: What are the two ways venom is created?**  
A: First, ignorance—not knowing how to use the tool, so it gets rusty and toxic because you're not using it. Second, protection—you have the tool to activate your potential, but you start thinking you need to protect yourself from the outer world, so you use the same tool to protect yourself instead of for the world. That's how it also becomes venom.

**Q: Why do spiders, snakes, and scorpions have venom?**  
A: Not because they are evil or "bad guys" of nature, but because they are weak. They are so weak that they had no other way to protect themselves than to take the potential they have within and create a venom to protect themselves from their weakness. Venom is born from weakness, not from evil.

**Q: How do I know what my venoms are?**  
A: Your venoms are the tools inside you that have become toxic because you're not using them properly—either from ignorance or from using them for protection instead of creation. They often manifest as hunger, rage, control, manipulation, and other emotions born from a conflict with love. Look for what you're protecting, what you feel weak about, what you lost. For example, if you didn't receive love, you might seek sugar (sweetness) as a substitute—the venom isn't the sugar but the weakness of love behind it.

**Q: What did the Snake Master mean by "we are all reptiles"?**  
A: Humans evolved through the animal way, driven by survival—eating, sleeping, feeling safe, reproducing. This information is ruled by the reptilian brain, the oldest, deepest part of our brain. We live like animals even though we can think. The Snake Master said humans are the ones ruling life through the reptilian brain, so we are the reptilians. If we want to take control of the world, we must be responsible and stop living through unconscious, reptilian patterns. Stop blaming others—they're taking care of the world until we're responsible enough to do it ourselves.

**Q: Why is Scorpio energy so intense about weakness and venom?**  
A: Whoever has a lot of Scorpio in their energy is used to seeing all the weakness of their own personality, going to the dark side of their soul, and seeing weakness in themselves and others. They have no problem saying, "This is my weakness, and this is yours." For most other signs, this is uncomfortable—they want light, not darkness. But Scorpio knows that you need to watch within the deeper darkness to heal. Otherwise, you just repeat the same problems over and over. Sometimes, to become a beautiful flower, you have to crawl on shit.

**Q: What does it mean that venom is "love in wrong doses"?**  
A: Venom is love that has been given in mistaken doses—too much or too little, not the proper amount. It's a bad administration of your love that becomes toxic. The same way a good thing in wrong doses can become poison in biology, love can also be toxic. An overdose of love is toxic. This is why when someone says, "I am all love, it's all love with me," they might be toxic. You have to be aware of that and give love in proper doses, coherently, responsibly.

**Q: How do I transform my venom back into love?**  
A: First, discover what your venoms are by asking your subconscious to show you what tools you've stopped using or are using for protection instead of creation. When you discover your venoms, you discover your weaknesses. When you discover your weaknesses, you understand what tools you lost. Once you see the venom clearly, you can start using the tool for its original purpose—not to protect yourself from the world, but to activate potential in the world. That transforms venom back into love. It requires responsibility, courage, and eating your own darkness from within instead of blaming darkness outside.
