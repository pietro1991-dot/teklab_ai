## Overview

Welcome to the third day of the emotional week, where we work with the throat chakra and the profound concept of expression. Before diving into today's teaching, it's important to address several foundational points for those joining this journey at different stages. This is work for the whole year, done day by day, but you don't have to follow it rigidly in sequence. If you need more time with certain concepts, or if you want to start from the very beginning, you can do it at your own pace as your being allows.

This teaching is being shared in both Spanish and English because these are the most widely spread languages globally. While it might be ideal to offer it in more languages, the speed and immediacy of sharing this information daily makes translation impractical. The information carries a specific vibration that comes through most authentically in the language it's originally channeled, which alternates between Spanish and English depending on the energy of the teaching.

A critical clarification about truth: What is being shared daily is not memories from other lives or claims to absolute truth. This is information known and felt from the higher self—personal truth being acknowledged and shared step by step. This is not a path for you to believe in what is being said. Rather, it is a path for you to start believing in what you are—in your own truth. The invitation is not to accept these teachings as THE truth, but as MY truth, shared authentically so you can find YOUR truth.

This distinction is essential, especially as we work with the throat chakra today. The throat is related to truth, but we must understand: there is no single absolute truth being claimed here. What is being shared is personal truth, acknowledged through awareness and coherence. You must find your own truth through resonance and your own awareness. This is how we work with genuine expression rather than dogma.

## Core Teaching

### The True Meaning of Expression

The word "expression" has a specific etymological origin that reveals its true function. Expression comes from "ex"—meaning to go out or to go beyond. The prefix "ex" gives origin to the English word "exit," meaning to go out. Combined with "press" (pressure), expression literally means to press outward, to release pressure outward.

Expression means to set free what you have pressed inside—to release what has been under oppression inside. We naturally use the word "expression" culturally today to mean artistic expression or natural expression, thinking of it as something creative. But expression is not specifically about creation; expression fundamentally means to set free, to release what is under tension within.

The opposite of expression is repression. "Re-press" means to go back to pressure, to return to compressed state. The prefix "re" in Latin means to go back, to return to. So repression means to put pressure back on something, to compress it again after it attempted to come out.

Let's use a physical metaphor to understand this clearly: Imagine you have a metal wire or string. When you apply pressure to it, it starts to bend. As you increase the pressure, it bends more and more. When the wire is bent into a tight, compressed shape, that curved form represents high frequency, high vibration. If we generate enough pressure into the vibration we have inside locked in the body, this vibration starts to spread and intensify, becoming higher and higher vibration until it tries to explode outward.

The place where all this pressure comes through in the human body is the voice, the throat. This spot—the throat chakra—is the one designed by nature to express, to release the vibration we have within. All the pressure we have within finds release through the throat, through speaking, expressing, and singing. This structure was created specifically to set vibration free.

### The Mechanism of Repression

If we have this natural tool—the throat—designed to set vibration free, what happens when instead of using it, we shut our mouth? When we don't speak, when we don't say what needs to be said, all that energy starts to be compressed inward. It becomes repressed.

The vibration we have inside is impressed in us—imprinted, printed into our being. What we have within is trying to express through us. If we shut up, what we do is re-press the vibration. Do you follow this progression of concepts? Expression releases; impression imprints inward; oppression puts external pressure on us; repression forces already-expressed energy back inward; depression is the sustained state of pressed-down energy.

For example, if instead of me shutting myself up, someone else tells me to shut up, we call that oppression—to put pressure on someone from outside. All these words relate to the same core concept: the pressure of something, the management of vibrational energy through compression and release.

Understanding this helps us realize that expression doesn't mean creating something new. Expression means to set free what is already within, waiting to come out. This is crucial for the next step of understanding.

### Everything Is Vibration Seeking Expression

When we grasp that expression is not creation but release, we can understand better what we truly are. Everything we are is fundamentally vibration. Everything we perceive, everything we feel, is vibration constantly moving and interacting. Emotional vibrations, feelings—everything is vibration.

If you're hearing this well, pay attention: if we know that what we see is just one aspect of the whole reality, then what we feel is also just one aspect of the whole reality. We must acknowledge that if what we see is limited by our perceptual capacity, what we feel is also limited. This is crucial to understand.

When we enter into conflict, when we start to perceive the world in judgmental ways saying "this thing is bad because I don't feel it" or "this thing is good because I feel it," we must remember we are limited by the frame of frequency we are able to feel and perceive. We discussed before how a person vibrating at approximately 700 hertz sees the entire universe in the color red. If you change the frequency, you see orange, then yellow. These are what we call parallel realities—different perceptual frames of the same underlying truth.

We relate chakras and colors with emotions. Depending on the vibration and frequency, I will see a certain color and relate to a certain feeling or emotion. We divide reality into different frames and aspects when really it's all one continuous spectrum. What we're doing is perceiving and interpreting the universe from whatever vibration and frequency we are currently vibrating at ourselves.

### The Naturalization of Shutting Down

Within this universe of thousands of perspectives and vibrations, when I realize that even though I'm only perceiving from my color, my frequency, my emotional range, there is so much more beyond my perception—in that moment I become conscious. To be conscious is not to go outside my own frequency and vibration. To be conscious is to realize that even though I have my own perception of reality, there are billions of other perceptions, and I can accept all of them as equally valid perspectives on the one truth.

One of the things this understanding helps us grasp is the concept that we often misunderstand about expression and communication. In the body, when we perceive something uncomfortable or threatening from outside, the neurological system—designed primarily for survival—interprets anything uncomfortable as potentially deadly.

The nervous system doesn't think complexly about why someone seems insecure or uncomfortable. The first thing it registers is: "danger—we might die." All biological bodies are, in a sense, hypochondriac. The nervous system was designed to protect us so we could keep living. Anything that might harm us is treated as a virus, as a threat.

One of the main things this system does to shut down threatening input, to not allow anything potentially harmful to come inside, is to purge and close all the points through which information enters the body. The first thing the body does is shut down the nose and mouth—these two are the main entry points that bring information from outside toward the lungs, the heart, the blood, and everywhere else.

What does the body do? It shuts, it closes the throat. You feel knots in your throat, tightness. The body creates reactions like coughing or sneezing to expel anything that might come in and harm us. We use expressions like "this smells bad," "there's something rotten," "this situation is disgusting"—these aren't just metaphors. The body literally responds to emotional threats the same way it responds to physical threats, by closing down entry points.

### The Emotional Immunological System

The body also tries to expel things through crying. Crying is a normal reaction to take everything painful outside. The eyes, mouth, nose, and throat—all these sensory and expressive organs—are the places where the body shuts down information flow when it feels threatened. Nothing can come inside; anything already inside that seems foreign must be expelled.

This happens quickly and physically, but it also happens energetically and emotionally. What we do emotionally is shut down. Everything that is usually expressed through us gets repressed inside. This circuit of energy that normally flows between us and our environment gets shut down, closed off.

This is the emotional immunological system trying to defend ourselves from something in the outside that maybe could be bad—though it could just as easily be good. We don't know initially; we just shut up and shut down. One of the main things we do is deny seeing reality clearly, shut our mouth to not say anything, and lose the ability to smell uncomfortable situations energetically.

We shut the doors we have to communicate with the outer world. For example, everything people could know about whether we're happy, sad, or mad comes through the triangle in our face—the eyes, nose, and mouth. When we have problems in this part of the face, it's about things we're trying to repress.

We must acknowledge that this is how we relate ourselves with the environment, with the world. This is how we work with what we're discussing: Are we expressing? Are we repressing? Are we being oppressed? Are others expressing while we shut down?

### How Do We Express in Life?

Expression is about allowing the energy and vibration we have within to express itself toward the outside. This is what we must acknowledge: Do we express in the world? What face do we put every day in the world? What emotions do we shut up?

Everything that comes from this—all expressions and repressions—come from the throat chakra, the center of authentic communication. The task for today is to recognize: What is the way I express in my life? Alternatively, do I even express in my life?

Some people express themselves better when they're mad. Some express themselves better when they're sad. Some find many different ways to express. Some express in silence. Others express through art, writing, or music. Try to recognize what is your way to express.

Usually, artists are actually the ones with the worst expression problems and emotional difficulties. Why? Because artists often make a mistake: they change the focus to something that is not the main problem. They put all their energy into art, but they're not actually facing what really needs to be expressed. They're using the art as a substitute for direct authentic expression.

We often make a mistake by comparing artistic expression with real emotional expression. Real expression is direct communication of what's true within. Artistic expression can be that, but it can also be a deflection, a way of expressing indirectly what we're afraid to say directly.

### The Path Forward: Calibration of Expression

Why do we need to look again at how we communicate with the outside? Because in this communication with others, we can teach our immunological system—both physical and emotional—that not everything coming from outside is going to kill us. Not every uncomfortable feeling means death. Not every challenge to our beliefs is an attack.

Each person will find their own way to calibrate this system. But the important thing is to realize: What do I do? How am I working with this right now, in this present moment?

Remember, we are not here to solve the problem in this single month. We are here to analyze the problem, to understand its mechanics. Let's go step by step. Today we're simply examining how expression and repression work in our lives. Later, we'll learn how to transform these patterns.

During this month of Virgo, we're in analysis mode. We're not trying to fix everything immediately. We're developing awareness of the patterns, understanding the mechanisms, seeing clearly what's actually happening. This analytical understanding is the necessary foundation for all transformation that comes later.

## Practice

### Preparation

Begin by stretching your body, yawning widely, and caressing yourself gently. Relax your body completely, sitting in a comfortable position. Let the weight of your body fall naturally as gravity supports you. Focus completely on your breathing, making it slow and conscious.

As you take deep breaths, use your imagination to guide the oxygen through your nose, down to your lungs, into your heart, and throughout your blood, organs, and muscles. Feel the heat within your body as life force energy circulates through every cell.

### Guided Meditation Steps

1. **Creating the Ocean of Vibration**
   - As you relax, start to feel the heat within your body radiating outward
   - This heat goes through your skin, expanding in all directions around you
   - Perceive the great ocean of vibration and emotion around you
   - Feel the calm of this ocean, the water gently pressing against your body
   - Allow yourself to feel the waves, the water moving your body side to side very softly

2. **Rising Toward Consciousness**
   - Observe above you, over the water, the light of the sun representing the I Am
   - With each breath, start to rise slowly, feeling your body moving upward through the water
   - Feel the limit of the water touching your head as you begin to emerge
   - Think of your head as an island slowly emerging from the ocean of emotion
   - The water's limit moves down your body as you rise

3. **Emerging Into Expression**
   - Feel the water line descending: down to your eyebrows, your eyes, your ears, nose
   - The water comes down past your lips, your chin
   - Feel all your head outside the water now
   - Your neck is emerging, coming out until it's completely above the sea
   - Feel the heat of the sun, its light on you
   - It dries your face, your head, your hair, your neck

4. **Breathing the Air of Truth**
   - Inspire—breathe in deeply the air that exists above the sea
   - This is the air of expression, the atmosphere of authentic truth
   - Recognize that it is your voice, emerging from your throat, that moves the waves
   - Your voice vibrates, bringing sound toward each part of the ocean
   - Recognize this is the sea of your expression
   - Only your voice can bring calm and clarity to this ocean

5. **Activating the Spark of Clarity**
   - Take a deep breath as you allow the light of the I Am to enter your body
   - Feel it coming through your crown, through your third eye
   - It shines powerfully in your throat chakra
   - When you start to make the sound, you will express the light and consciousness of the I Am with its clarity
   - Begin vibrating: PHe... PHe... PHe...
   - This sound brings calm to your ocean, releasing pressure as pure expression

6. **Recognizing Your Expressive Power**
   - Keep pronouncing the sound: PHe... PHe... PHe...
   - Recognize that it's your expression that sets free the tension in your ocean of creation
   - Feel the light of the I Am as a spark bringing clarity to all expressions
   - Realize that your expressions are bringing consciousness and clarity to reality
   - Take a deep breath and affirm: "I Am the Spark of Clarity"
   - Repeat: "I Am the Spark of Clarity... I Am the Spark of Clarity"

7. **Integration and Release**
   - Take your hands to your heart
   - Become aware of all the vibration you have inside, waiting for the moment to go out
   - This vibration is waiting to say the truth, to express the truth of who you really are
   - Realize that fear is what represses you—fear of being harmed, fear of being alone
   - These fears are not allowing you to express; they repress who you are
   - Recognize that you are the only one capable of enlightening the spark
   - You alone can bring clarity, express truth, and show the reality of who you are
   - Affirm: "I Am the Spark of Clarity... I Am the Spark of Clarity... I Am the Spark of Authority"

8. **Final Release**
   - Take a deep breath
   - Set free from your heart all the sounds you have inside waiting to be said, waiting to be expressed
   - Say anything that comes: sounds, words, whatever wants to emerge
   - Let it come out freely, without judgment
   - This is pure expression, pure release of compressed vibration

### Closing

Bring consciousness all over your body by caressing it, stretching, yawning. Each person at their own time, come back to this present moment and space, opening your eyes when ready.

## Key Insights

- **"Expression means 'ex-press'—to press outward, to set free what you have pressed inside. It's not creation; it's release."**

- **"The opposite of expression is repression—'re-press' means to go back to pressure, to compress again what tried to come out."**

- **"When you apply pressure to a wire, it bends. That bent shape represents high frequency. Pressure creates high vibration seeking release."**

- **"The throat was designed by nature to express, to release vibration. This is the pressure valve for all compressed energy within."**

- **"If you shut your mouth when energy wants to come out, you don't eliminate it—you repress it, compress it back into your system."**

- **"Oppression is when someone else tells you to shut up—external pressure on your expression."**

- **"Everything we are is vibration. Everything we perceive and feel is vibration constantly interacting."**

- **"To be conscious is not to transcend your frequency—it's to realize that while you have your perception, billions of other valid perceptions exist."**

- **"The nervous system treats anything uncomfortable as potentially deadly. It shuts down all entry points—nose, mouth, throat—to prevent perceived threats."**

- **"The emotional immunological system makes us shut up, deny reality, close down—trying to protect us from what might not even be harmful."**

- **"Everything people can know about our emotional state comes through the triangle of face—eyes, nose, mouth. Problems here indicate repression."**

- **"Artists often have the worst expression problems because they deflect real expression into art instead of direct authentic communication."**

- **"We confuse artistic expression with real expression. Real expression is direct truth. Art can be that, or it can be sophisticated avoidance."**

- **"In communication with others, we teach our immunological system that not everything from outside will kill us."**

- **"This is my truth I'm sharing, not THE truth. You must find your own truth through resonance and awareness."**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

The task for today has two parts:

**Part One:** Write down how you express in your life. What is your primary mode of expression? Do you express when angry? When sad? In silence? Through art or writing? Or do you struggle to express at all? This is pure observation without judgment.

**Part Two:** Express everything you've been holding back. This can be done privately—you don't have to say it to the people involved. You can write it, speak it alone, scream it into a pillow, whatever allows the compressed energy to finally release. Say everything you've shut up, everything you've kept silent about in your life. This is the actual work of expression—setting free what's been pressed inside for too long.

### Applying This Teaching

Start noticing when you feel the urge to speak but stop yourself. What's the fear underneath? Fear of judgment? Fear of conflict? Fear of rejection? These fears trigger your immunological response, making you shut down your throat chakra and repress your truth.

Practice small expressions daily. If you normally stay silent when someone says something you disagree with, try expressing your perspective gently. If you normally deflect with humor when something hurts you, try expressing "that actually hurt me" directly. These small practices retrain your system to recognize that authentic expression doesn't equal death.

Remember the distinction between your truth and THE truth. You're not claiming to know absolute reality when you express. You're simply sharing your authentic perception and experience. This removes the pressure of needing to be "right" and allows for honest sharing of your subjective reality.

Notice when you're using creative expression as a substitute for direct communication. Art, writing, and music are beautiful forms of expression, but they can also be sophisticated avoidance of saying what needs to be said directly to specific people. Both have their place—just be honest about which one you're doing.

## Q&A

### Q: If I express everything I feel, won't I hurt people and damage relationships?

Expression doesn't mean dumping every thought and feeling on everyone around you without consciousness. It means developing the capacity to authentically communicate your truth when appropriate. There's a difference between reactive venting and conscious authentic expression. You can express your truth with compassion, with timing, with awareness of impact. The question isn't whether to express, but how to express in ways that honor both your truth and your relationships.

### Q: What if my truth changes? Won't I seem inconsistent or unreliable?

Your truth evolving is a sign of growth, not inconsistency. Today's authentic truth might be different from tomorrow's authentic truth as you gain new perspectives and experiences. This is transformation, not confusion. The key is being honest about where you are right now, while remaining open to evolution. People who judge you for growing are stuck in their own rigidity. Those who support your evolution will respect your authentic expression even as it changes.

### Q: How do I know if I'm repressing or just being appropriately private?

Repression feels like pressure building inside—there's energy wanting to come out that you're forcing back down. Privacy is calm holding of information that doesn't demand release. Repression creates physical symptoms: tension in throat, jaw clenching, digestive issues, suppressed crying, anger outbursts about unrelated things. Privacy creates peace. Check your body. If there's pressure, compression, tightness, you're repressing. If there's calm containment, you're being appropriately private.

### Q: What about situations where expressing could literally be dangerous, like oppressive political systems or abusive relationships?

Survival takes precedence over expression in genuinely dangerous situations. But even in these contexts, you can express to yourself privately—journaling, recording yourself, creating art that captures your truth even if never shared. The goal is to prevent the complete shutting down of your expressive capacity. When safety allows, find trusted spaces for expression. And work toward creating or finding environments where authentic expression is safe. Your truth doesn't disappear just because it's temporarily unsafe to share it externally.

### Q: Why do artists have the worst expression problems if art is expression?

Because art can become a substitute for direct expression rather than an extension of it. An artist might paint their anger instead of addressing the person they're angry with. They might write songs about loneliness instead of reaching out for connection. The art becomes a pressure valve that releases just enough energy to prevent explosion but not enough to actually resolve the underlying issue. True artistic expression comes from people who also express directly in their lives—then the art becomes an extension and deepening of authentic communication, not a replacement for it.

### Q: How can I tell if I'm expressing my truth or just imposing my perspective on others?

When you express your truth, you share your subjective experience without demanding others agree. "I feel hurt when this happens" vs. "You're a hurtful person." When you impose perspective, you claim your subjective experience is objective reality that others must accept. Notice the difference: "This feels wrong to me" (your truth) vs. "This IS wrong" (claimed objective truth). Your truth is always framed as your experience, your perception, your feeling. The moment you claim it as THE truth that applies to everyone, you've moved from expression to imposition.

### Q: What's the connection between the throat chakra and the crown chakra shown in this practice?

The crown receives the light of consciousness—pure awareness. The throat expresses that consciousness into form through sound and word. You can have consciousness (crown) without expression (throat), but then it remains unmanifest. Expression without consciousness is just noise—reactive venting without awareness. When crown and throat work together, conscious awareness finds authentic articulate expression. This is why the practice moves from activating crown awareness to expressing through throat—consciousness must inform expression for it to carry true clarity.

### Q: If everything is vibration seeking expression, does that mean all repression is inherently bad?

Not all containment is repression. There's conscious timing—waiting for the right moment to express. There's discernment—choosing not to express something that would cause harm without benefit. These are conscious choices, different from unconscious repression. Repression is unconscious compression of energy that wants to move. Conscious containment is aware holding until appropriate expression is possible. Check the difference: Does it feel like you're sitting on a pressure cooker (repression) or are you calmly holding something precious until the right time (conscious containment)?

---

**Note:** This teaching emphasizes that authentic expression is not about creating something new but about releasing what has been compressed within. The throat chakra serves as the natural pressure valve for all the vibrations we experience and hold. Learning to express consciously and authentically, without claiming absolute truth but sharing personal truth, is essential for emotional health and spiritual coherence.
