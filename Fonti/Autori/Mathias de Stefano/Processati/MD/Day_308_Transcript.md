## Introduction

Well , hi everybody. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

Sorry I connected 20 minutes before , but this is the only opportunity. The only chance that I have to do this now because I 'm really tired today. I just slept two hours. I 've been awakened doing things for 22 , 21 hours.

I 'm really really tired , but I 'm actually inside the bed right now. I 'm covered with the blanket. But I 'm really tired and even though I did n't want to let I stay without connecting with all of you and to share with you what happened today and what we 're going to do tomorrow.

So we all can be in the same page and feeling connected to the same vibration of the world we 're doing.

So today we went to the temples of Karla and the temple of Genera and both temples we did today in the morning and then in the evening.

So that 's why it 's been too much. It 's been a lot and something that I commented to the people today is that it 's amazing that usually in the trips that we do that we come without any kind of preparation for the temples. Usually the priest and priest is that they take a long time to prepare us in order to feel or receive the information the energy that we are supposed to receive.

So sometimes it 's really tough because we need a long kind of preparation. But these times it was n't a need for that because every day we are preparing ourselves in a specific structure to turn the key to open the temple energetically and each one knows what they have to do , what they represent and everything works so perfectly that the priest practices from other dimensions when they start to work with us they go straight to the point. I think it 's incredible what is happening so perfectly.

So I have to thank my friends , the guys that are here help me to organize everything with the people and of course I have to thank all the people that are here with us because they have been going through a very hard process of not sleeping doing many work and trying to understand many things in the shortest moment in a short time and everything is going perfectly everything is working incredibly because everyone is doing what they are supposed to do and it 's amazing so thank you to all the people that are here right now.

So today in Karla we worked with the spine , the spine of which is the axis of Siris for the time ten point of view is not a god , it 's a concept that the person has to go through the spine of Siris through 33 vertebra alone and in Static Path. During this path a person gains wisdom but also the power , the strength of holding the everything so what we were working today is specifically was to build that column that 's time to hold with strength the axis of the world.

So we have been doing that and it 's been really really beautiful even if it 's difficult to transmit everything that really happens because some things you just have to live them but basically it was really powerful what happened today with the axis. We had the visit of a priestess that made us do the activation in the shape of an orgasm so basically she said that the earth is like a woman that is repressed and and the sky is like the masculine aspect that is willing to to fertilizer the earth but we have to remind the system , the the greed of the earth that is important to feel pleasure to that you have to discover love through the pleasure of feeling the body of feeling the matter.

So that was the the the main concept that I can rescue from from everything that happened in then that.

So basically today what we have been working as a summary is the strength of the axis with wisdom in the planet and the expansion of the energy through the through the pleasure the happiness of being here.

So in three hours we have to wake up to go to a serious tempo where we will work with the vibration to expand the consciousness through the NA the need of the of the planetary network. I need to sleep. I am losing already my mind. I need to rest so I will go.

We have to connect now with with the tempo with this new tempo.

So just wanted to to share this with you so you are in the same page you can you can know it 's what we have done today and and you can know what we are going to do tomorrow.

## Guided Meditation

So I am not able to guide the meditation of course today so but I wanted to to start it so you can go and do it so you can connect with all of us.

So remember today we are in the missed chara and so we connect with the music as always do the alignment with information that you have in social media and here in this video and so we can all be in the same harmony today.

So I 'm so sorry that I am in this situation but I told you last week that it would be like this this days but I guess that from tomorrow and the other days I will have much more time and rest so I can be here with you as always.

So feel you tomorrow connected through the Oceanian temple expanding the network of the flowerfly.

So thank you everybody for being here and as always see you tomorrow but for sure at this same time. You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
