## Overview

Day 33 continues the Mental Week of Virgo with a profound exploration of truth and lies, moving from the Third Eye's qualities down to the Throat chakra's expression. Yesterday we examined the tools we have—our qualities and attributes. Today we investigate what we do with those tools: how we express, communicate, and share our perception of reality through the filter of truth and lies.

The teaching begins with a spectacular synchronicity—fireworks erupting at the pyramids in Egypt just as the session starts, a fabulous way to inaugurate work on the throat chakra of expression and communication. Matias acknowledges that the Virgo month is heavy, dense with concepts and analytical work. He reminds us there's no rush—these videos are recorded, available whenever we need them. We have our whole lives to do this inner work. The key is not to push ourselves beyond readiness, but to take it slow, take our time, and work at our own pace.

The core revelation of Day 33 is radical: **there is no absolute truth in the universe. Everything is perception.** What we call "truth" is simply the perception of outer reality that we have made our own, that we feel related to. The famous example of the color red illustrates this perfectly. When we see red, we're not actually seeing an objective thing called "red"—we're perceiving electromagnetic waves at 680 nanometers that our ocular nerves translate into the experience we call red. The color doesn't exist independently. If our brain's nervous system isn't working properly (like in colorblindness), we see the "same" wavelength differently. Everything we perceive is filtered, translated, interpreted.

This understanding dismantles the common notion that truth is something absolute we must seek and defend. Instead, truth is revealed as our vibration within the great wave of reality. If we resonate at the frequency of "red" (680 nanometers), our reality is red. Everything we see will be filtered through that red lens. When someone from the "orange" reality tells us the universe is orange, we call them a liar—but they're simply vibrating at a different frequency. Both are true within their own resonance. The teaching invites us to stop judging others' lies and start examining our own: the lies we tell ourselves to distort reality, to feel safe, to avoid change.

The profound work of Day 33 is recognizing that while we cannot control the universal truth, we can become conscious of our personal truth and our personal lies—especially the lies we create to protect ourselves from transformation.

## Core Teaching

### The Nature of Reality and Perception

First, we must understand what truth actually is. Truth is a perception of the outer world that I have made my own. It's a perception I can see, I am related to, so it becomes mine. Let's be clear about this from the start: the truth in the universe—the one we think we know—doesn't exist. There is no absolute truth. There is no ultimate reality.

Always, reality will give us perspectives. The perception of those realities is what we feel related to. We must understand that truth is not exactly what we think of when we use the word. What can we relate it with to understand better?

### The Red Color Example: Electromagnetic Waves

Matias wrote about the color red to illustrate this concept. We all see the red color. We say the color exists—we can see red, point to it, agree on it. But **the red doesn't exist**. What we see is just the perception of our ocular nerves receiving a longitude of electromagnetic waves at 680 nanometers. We perceive it as red. It doesn't objectively exist.

If we put it in this way, nothing that we can see really exists. Everything is just a conjunction of atoms. Everything we see, everything we perceive, is just the conjunction of magnetism, waves, photons. That's it. Every perception we have from the outer world will be processed by the system of our brain, by the nervous system of our brain.

If my brain is not working properly—if it's not functioning correctly—I will see the color in a different way, like a person with colorblindness (daltonism). What does this help us understand? **Everything is a perception.**

### Beliefs Create the Filter for Truth

The first thing we work with—everything we receive from the outer world—is a belief. We build an idea through what we perceive of the world's reality. According to all these energies we receive, I will have one perception that's positive, one that's negative, one that's awakened, one that's asleep. These are my qualities.

Talking about qualities, imagine and picture that in the longitude of waves, if I am resonating, vibrating in the 680 nanometers, my reality, my attribute will be red. The attributes, the qualities I have, are related with my vibration in the wave. Everyone, all of us, we are one. But each one of us is vibrating at a different level inside the wave.

This is what gives us the perception of reality from our point of view—from the point of view of red. Everything I see around will be filtered by the color red. The truth I see around me will be red.

### The Orange Universe and the Red Universe

Imagine that you see everything red. Suddenly someone comes and says, "No, this is not the truth, this is not the reality. You are seeing the reality—the reality is only a wave that connects us all."

The red one would say, "Yes, of course, whatever you want. But I see everything red."

Can we understand how the reality is? When we ask ourselves what is reality, I will always understand the reality through my own vibration. When I change my vibration from red, I go into orange—red, orange. What happened? We change our vibration from red into orange. I would say, "Oh my God, the reality wasn't red! The reality was orange!"

But orange is your new reality. You will defend that reality. Suddenly you will work harder to become yourself more and more orange, more balanced in the orange. Suddenly you go into yellow. You see yellow. You say, "Oh my God, it was big—it's bigger! The universe is yellow!"

And so on. We can go through thousands, billions of colors, billions of waves, until we picture, "Oh yeah, it was a wave. It was not a color." In the end, you realize about the whole wave. You say, "Yes, the wave is the answer." Suddenly you realize the wave can also behave itself as a particle in quantum mechanics. Suddenly you say, "Like, it's a whole new universe—parallel universes!" It goes on and on and on.

### Truth is Always from Your Point of View

When we ask ourselves "What is the truth?" the answer will always be: **the truth is my point of view.** All the rest is just distortions.

Something very important to understand is this: if I position myself in red, I see the whole reality in red. Suddenly someone from orange, someone from magenta will come and say, "Hey, the universe is magenta." Someone from orange would say, "Hey, the universe is orange."

I would say, "No, neither of you are right. The reality is red."

The two other colors—the orange and the magenta—for me will be distortions of reality. To those distortions of reality, we humans used to call them **lies**.

This is the first point you could understand: What is truth? What is a lie?

### Lies as Distortions from Other Frequencies

When someone from the orange universe comes to me and says, "Hey, the universe is orange," I would usually say to him, "No, you are lying to me."

Did you follow me? If not, you can listen again.

Now we go to the other point of view of truth and lies. The lie is my own. The other point of view of truth is: myself being in red, in the red universe, I will create my own reality through the color red. Everything I will do will be red. Even if some day I just realize the universe is bigger—there's not only one red perception—even though I recognize the red as my own truth ("That's my truth"), the question would be: Are you wrong for saying "This is my truth, this is the truth," even if you know that there is more truth?

No, you are not wrong. You are just watching everything from your point of view. For you, that's the truth. Red exists for you. It is your own reality.

### Protecting Truth by Distorting It: Fear-Based Lies

Now picture that when you recognize there is the red universe, suddenly you have some other people in the universe, the red universe, around you. Because maybe you're afraid, you know there's a bigger universe. There's a bigger universe around. You are afraid that maybe the other universe would change the people around you.

What you do is turn to those people and say to them, "There is no other truth. The only truth is the red universe. Everything is red. There is nothing around. There's nothing more. Just this."

So, what are you doing? You're not lying—for us, it's a lie. Their universe IS red. Yeah, it's the truth. But you are distorting the truth, saying that this is the only thing that exists.

### The Trap of Judging Others' Lies

Now I'm feeling the conflict between all of us. The first thing we do is to judge others. Suddenly we start to say, "Yes, there's people lying to us. The church, the religions, the Illuminati, the governments—everyone is lying to us. They keep us trapped in this universe. There is much more."

The question we have to make to ourselves is: **Did I lie to myself?**

That's the shift. From doing outward judgment, we must turn inward. That change we call consciousness.

### The Daily Lies We Tell Ourselves

What we start to do is think about ourselves. "Am I lying to myself?" We usually think that there are big lies. The big lies are made up of tiny ones—the ones we make every day. The ones we usually do to distort, to create distortion in our own reality, to adjust the reality to our own beliefs and perceptions.

This is something we all do every time, always. It's a way of survival. It's a way our body says, "I find myself secure, safe." So what I do is—to say it in English—to cheat myself. To cheat myself because I am afraid of changing. I'm afraid of what I'm going to become.

**That's the key to dissolving all the rest of the lies: to stop seeing that others are lying to us and to recognize in what moments you lie to yourself.** From there, you can change the rest.

### Truth and Lies in Our Own Expression

This is the chakra we must understand: what are its truths, which are its lies? Which lies are coming from my mouth? Which lies are coming in, building my inner world?

We all lie to ourselves constantly. We all lie to ourselves constantly, in such a way, even in tiny things. Like, for example, "Long hair fits me fine, it's good on me, long hair." A tiny lie.

But also, there are many other lies that we have built through years. We hold them. They create the basement of who we are. Lies are fear—fear to change. If I start to transform my fear, to transcend my fear, I don't need any more lies.

Lies—the only thing they do is to make a distortion in the reality to protect that reality. Maybe you will be asking me, "Can you give me examples?" There are many examples, but each one of you is different. I won't be able to say one for each. That's why I usually say mine.

### Personal Examples of Truth and Lies

What are my truths? My truths are those things I have said that made me be, that made me recognize who I am. The beliefs are the things I believe, I think about the world, about life. Truth are those things I say that I admit: "Yes, I am. I am." An example of saying my truth is like the moment of your life you couldn't stand anymore. You just spit it out and say to others, "Yes, I am." "I am."

The lies are those things I say or say to myself to draw the reality so I can keep it safe within me.

After this, what we are going to do is write down—to write down, yes. "This is who I am. I am. I am. I am. This is my truth, who I really are." The lies: "I would say yes, I have lied to me in this. I have lied to others with this."

It's possible that maybe you will take even years, not only days, to figure out a lie. Remember, it's not about lies that other people put on me. It's about my own lies—the ones I made up, the ones I created. Acknowledging, thinking: "Hmm, what is the thing that helps us? That helps us to understand—how can I find, how can I find the distortions that filter my connection from the consciousness with my heart?"

Remember, always the work is about the inner self, not the outer world. I have created my own truths, my own lies.

## Practice

### Preparation

Find a comfortable position. Focus on your breathing. Let yourself relax deeply. Take a very deep breath, bringing your oxygen to your lungs, then guide it to your heart, blood, organs, and muscles. Allow the breath to go outside through your skin, filling up your aura and all the energetical patterns around you.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Throat Chakra

1. **Feel the energy above your head.** Recognize the light of the I Am above you. With your imagination, bring all your energy around toward the crown, filling up the I Am, going through every one of your potentials, your qualities inside your third eye.

2. **Bring the I Am to the throat.** Taking a deep breath, observe the light of the I Am coming down to your throat. Recognize your throat—all the learnings you've received in the path of life, all your truths and your lies assimilated through experience.

3. **Acknowledge truth and lie without judgment.** Without thinking much, without judging, allow yourself to receive the idea of the first lie that comes to your mind—the one you said to others or the one you said to yourself. Then recognize the truth that comes to your mind, the one you share with others, you set, you spoke to others. Don't think. Don't judge. Feel one in your right part of the throat, the other one in the left side. No charging.

4. **Recognize the center.** Take a deep breath. Recognize what is in the center. You perceive the truth of the world according to your perception. This is also the place you distortion the reality. It is your job to find balance in between. Where you distortion the reality, you can find harmony with your truth.

5. **Pronounce the vibration.** Take a deep breath and start to pronounce the sound: **Ne... Ne... Ne...** Expand the light of the I Am through your throat chakra. No name.

6. **Connect truth and lies.** As you keep pronouncing the sound, feel and perceive that your truth and your lies start to connect as one in the same vibration wave, resonance, in harmony with coherence. Recognize the I Am in the center of your truth. Recognize its essence as a messenger of coherence and truth here and now.

7. **Embody the statement.** Take a deep breath. Recognize: "I am the Emissary of Truth. I am the Emissary of Truth. I am the Emissary of Truth."

### Closing

Take your hands to your heart to balance the truth. Say: "I am who will recognize every reality from the perception of its own truth. I am the one the distortion is taught, the reality, the truth made in them as lies. I am the only one capable to untangle the tension between my lies and truth, the distortion of realities. I am the Messenger of Truth. I am the Emissary of Truth."

Take a deep breath. Start to bring the information from your heart with your hands towards all your body. Stretch, yawn, caress. Come back to the present moment and gently open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write down your truths and your lies.

**Truths:** These are statements you have made (to yourself or others) that define who you really are. They are the moments you couldn't stand it anymore and you just spoke your authentic self: "Yes, I am..." These are the things you admit about yourself that feel aligned with your deepest recognition.

**Lies:** These are the things you've said to yourself or to others that distort reality to make you feel safer. They protect you from change. They keep reality contained within comfortable boundaries. These can be tiny ("long hair looks good on me" when deep down you know it doesn't) or massive (fundamental distortions about who you are or what's possible).

Remember, you might take days, months, or even years to identify some lies. The work is not rushed. It's about your own inner world—the distortions that filter your connection from consciousness to heart.

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice when you judge someone else as "lying" or being "wrong." Instead of immediately dismissing them, ask yourself: "What frequency are they vibrating at? What is their truth from their perspective?" This doesn't mean you have to agree or adopt their viewpoint. It means you recognize they're perceiving from a different wavelength in the great spectrum of reality.

More importantly, catch yourself in the small lies—the ones you tell yourself to avoid discomfort, change, or growth. When you say, "I'm fine" but you're not fine, that's a lie. When you say, "I can't do that" but you actually could with effort, that's a lie. When you distort your perception to protect your current reality, notice it. Consciousness begins with recognizing these moments.

The throat chakra is the bridge between the emotional and mental centers—between heart and mind. When you speak truth aligned with both feeling and thinking, you create coherence. When you speak lies (even to yourself), you create distortion and dissonance. The practice is to bring these two—truth and lies—into balance, recognizing both exist within you, and choosing consciously which to amplify.

## Q&A

### Q: If there's no absolute truth, does that mean everything is relative and nothing matters?

No. It means truth is relational, not relative in a nihilistic sense. Your truth is real for you because you're vibrating at that frequency. The color red is genuinely real at 680 nanometers—it's not imaginary. The point is that someone vibrating at orange (590 nanometers) has a different but equally real truth. Both exist. The invitation is to stop fighting over whose truth is "right" and start understanding that truth is perception filtered through vibration. What matters is becoming conscious of YOUR truth and YOUR lies, not judging others'.

### Q: How can I tell the difference between a truth and a lie I'm telling myself?

Truth feels like recognition—like something you finally admitted that you'd been avoiding. It often comes with relief or a sense of alignment. Lies feel like protection—they're the stories you tell to avoid change, discomfort, or facing something difficult. A truth might be "I'm angry at my mother." A lie might be "I'm fine, everything's fine with my family." The lie keeps you safe from having to deal with the anger. The truth opens the door to transformation. Ask yourself: "Does this statement protect me from growth, or does it acknowledge reality as I actually experience it?"

### Q: Why should I examine my own lies instead of focusing on the lies told to me by society, religion, or government?

Because you cannot control what others do, but you can control your own consciousness. When you spend energy judging external lies, you give away your power. When you examine your own lies, you reclaim it. Moreover, the lies you tell yourself are often more limiting than any external lie, because you believe them completely and unconsciously. The "big lies" of institutions are made up of millions of tiny personal lies people tell themselves. Change begins within. As Matias says, "That change we call consciousness."

### Q: Does this mean I should tell everyone every truth I know, even if it hurts them?

No. There's a difference between being conscious of truth and using truth as a weapon. The throat chakra teaching is about coherence—bringing your inner truth into alignment with how you express it. Sometimes the most coherent expression is silence. Sometimes it's gentle honesty. Sometimes it's fierce truth-telling. The work is to stop lying to YOURSELF, to recognize your own distortions. How and when you share truth with others is a separate discernment that requires compassion and wisdom.

### Q: If I'm vibrating at "red" and someone else is vibrating at "orange," how do we communicate?

You recognize that you're perceiving from different frequencies and you seek understanding rather than conversion. You might say, "From my perspective, this is what I see. I understand you're seeing something different. Can you help me understand your view?" This creates dialogue instead of argument. The goal isn't to make everyone see red or everyone see orange—it's to recognize we're all part of the same wave, experiencing different aspects of it.

### Q: What if I identify a lie I've been telling myself but I'm not ready to change it?

That's perfectly okay. Consciousness doesn't demand immediate action. Simply recognizing "Oh, this is a lie I tell myself to feel safe" is valuable work. You might need that lie for now. But once you see it, you can't fully unsee it. Over time, as you become stronger, you may naturally let it go. Or you may keep it consciously, knowing exactly what you're doing. Either way, you've moved from unconsciousness to consciousness, and that's the real transformation.

### Q: How do truths relate to the beliefs we worked with on Day 31 and the qualities from Day 32?

Beliefs are what you expect reality to be—your foundational assumptions. Qualities are the tools you inherited from those beliefs—the attributes of your personality. Truths are what you accept as real based on your experience and perception. So: belief ("I believe the universe is loving") → quality ("I am compassionate") → truth ("I have experienced love and that's real for me"). They build on each other. Lies are distortions you introduce at the truth level to protect yourself from aspects of reality that challenge your beliefs or require using qualities you haven't developed.

### Q: This teaching seems to suggest that my truth is just as valid as anyone else's, even if we completely contradict each other. How can that be?

Both truths are valid *within their own frequency range*. The person in the red universe truly sees red. The person in the orange universe truly sees orange. Both are perceiving the same underlying reality (the electromagnetic wave) from different positions on the spectrum. The contradiction is apparent, not ultimate. At the deepest level, you're both experiencing the wave. The differences arise from where you're positioned on it. This isn't moral relativism—it's understanding that perception is mediated by vibration. Some positions on the spectrum create more harmony, coherence, and capacity to see the whole. That's what we're working toward: expanding our bandwidth so we can perceive more of the wave, not just defending our narrow slice of it.

**End of Day 33**
