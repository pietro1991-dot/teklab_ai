## Overview

Day 185. We are reaching the end of the Mental Week of Aquarius, and today we move into the **plexus chakra**—the center of **personal power, responsibility, and self-mastery**. The topic is **Sirius**, the **brightest star in the night sky**, located in the constellation **Canis Major** (the Great Dog).

Sirius is only **8.6 light-years from Earth**—incredibly close in cosmic terms—and it has been the most important star for many ancient civilizations, including the **Egyptians** (who aligned their calendar with the rising of Sirius) and the **Dogon tribe** in Africa (who claim ancient contact with beings from Sirius).

But today's teaching is not about ancient mythology or alien civilizations. Today's teaching is deeply **personal**. It's about an experience Matias had when he was **channeling** in front of a large audience, an experience that changed his life forever. An experience of standing in front of **over 20,000 beings from across the galaxy**, all gathered in a council to discuss one question:

**"Is humanity ready?"**

And Matias, in that moment, had to take responsibility for the fact that **he had pointed to Earth** as the planet where a very difficult experiment would take place—an experiment to see if consciousness could evolve in extreme limitation, darkness, and forgetting.

The beings in the council were debating. Some said humanity is ready now. Others said humanity needs **two more cycles of 26,000 years**—meaning another **52,000 years** of evolution before humans could truly take their place in the galactic family.

And Matias felt **guilt**. Deep, overwhelming guilt. Because he had been part of the decision to point Earth as the experiment planet. And now, seeing how much pain and struggle humanity was going through, he wondered: "Did I do the right thing?"

This is a teaching about **growing up spiritually**. About moving from being a **kindergarten teacher** (thinking you're helping others) to **taking real responsibility** (facing the consequences of your choices). About recognizing that **you are not a victim of reality—you are a creator of reality**. And when you truly understand that, everything changes.

This is the energy of Sirius. This is the vibration **Nï**. This is the statement **"I Am Emissary of Unit"**—meaning, I take responsibility for my role in the whole.

## Core Teaching

### Sirius: The Brightest Star and the Galactic Council

Sirius is the **brightest star visible from Earth**, and it has been revered by cultures all over the world for thousands of years. The Egyptians called it **Sopdet** and aligned their entire calendar with its heliacal rising (when it appears just before the sun in the morning sky). The Dogon people in Mali claim their ancestors were visited by beings from Sirius who taught them advanced astronomy.

In Matias's memory, **Sirius is not just a star system**—it's a **meeting point**. A place where **galactic councils gather** to discuss the evolution of consciousness throughout the galaxy. It's like the United Nations, but for star civilizations.

And in one of these councils, Matias was there. Not in his current human body, but in another form, another time, another dimension. And the topic of discussion was: **Earth**.

### The Question: Is Humanity Ready?

The council was debating whether humanity—us, here, now—is **ready to join the galactic community**. Ready to take responsibility. Ready to stop behaving like children. Ready to move from unconsciousness to consciousness.

Some beings in the council said: "Yes, they're ready. Look at how much they've evolved in such a short time. They went from caves to space travel in just a few thousand years. They're on the verge of a massive awakening."

But others said: "No. They're not ready. They're still fighting each other. They're still destroying their planet. They're still operating from fear, greed, and separation. Give them two more **26,000-year cycles** (another 52,000 years) to mature."

And Matias, watching this debate, realized something horrifying: **He had been the one to point to Earth** as the planet where this experiment would happen.

### The Guilt of Pointing Earth

What does that mean—"pointing to Earth"?

It means that at some point, in a galactic council meeting long ago, the question was asked: "Where should we run this experiment? Where should we create a place where consciousness forgets itself completely, where beings are cut off from the galactic family, where they have to rediscover who they are from scratch?"

And Matias (or the being he was at that time) raised his hand and said: "Earth. Let's do it on Earth."

And everyone agreed. And the experiment began.

And now, millions of years later, standing in front of this council, Matias felt the weight of that choice. He saw the wars, the suffering, the pain, the confusion. He saw humans struggling to survive, to understand, to remember. And he thought: "Did I make a mistake? Did I cause all of this?"

This is the moment of **taking responsibility**. Not in a light, spiritual, "everything is love" way. But in a deep, gut-wrenching, "I am accountable for the consequences of my choices" way.

### Growing Up: From Kindergarten Teacher to Real Responsibility

Matias explains this using a metaphor:

When you're a **kindergarten teacher**, you think you're doing a great job. You're helping children. You're teaching them. You're guiding them. And you feel good about yourself because you're "making a difference."

But then you grow up, and you realize: being a kindergarten teacher is easy. The kids are small. The problems are small. You're not really facing the hard questions of life. You're playing it safe.

**Real responsibility** is when you step into the adult world and face the consequences of real decisions. It's when you realize: "My choices affect others. My actions create ripples. I am not just a helper—I am a creator."

This is what the Sirius council was showing Matias. It was saying: "Stop playing kindergarten teacher. Stop pretending you're helping humanity from the outside. You ARE humanity. You were part of the choice that created this reality. Now take responsibility for it."

### The Morpheus Teaching: Dream vs. Reality

There's a beautiful line in the movie *The Matrix* when **Morpheus** says to Neo:

*"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"*

Matias connects this to the teaching of Sirius. He says:

**"Most people live their lives thinking reality is real and dreams are fake. But spiritual people flip this and think dreams are real and reality is fake. Both are wrong."**

The truth is: **You must live reality AS IF it is a dream, and live your dreams AS IF they are reality.**

- **Live reality as a dream:** Recognize that the physical world is not as solid, permanent, or serious as you think. It's fluid. It's malleable. It's a projection of consciousness. When you remember this, you stop being a victim of circumstances and start being a creator.

- **Live dreams as reality:** Recognize that your inner visions, your intuitions, your spiritual experiences are not "just imagination"—they are real. They are guidance. They are memory. When you honor them as real, you align your actions with your higher knowing.

This is the balance. This is the maturity. This is growing up.

### YHVH: The Four Great Letters (Tetragrammaton)

At one point in the teaching, Matias mentions **YHVH**—the **Tetragrammaton**, the four-letter name of God in Hebrew tradition.

**Y-H-V-H** (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh) is often translated as "I Am That I Am" or "I Will Be What I Will Be."

But Matias says it differently. He says:

**"YHVH is the sound of asking a question to yourself."**

- **Y** (Yod): The question
- **H** (Heh): The breath, the opening
- **V** (Vav): The connection, the bridge
- **H** (Heh): The answer, the exhale

When you ask a question to yourself—not to someone else, not to God, but to **yourself**—you activate the YHVH vibration. You become the question and the answer. You become the creator.

This is the teaching of Sirius. **Stop asking questions to others. Start asking questions to yourself.**

- Don't ask: "What are you saying?" Ask: "What am I hearing?"
- Don't ask: "Why is this happening to me?" Ask: "What am I creating?"
- Don't ask: "What should I do?" Ask: "What do I know?"

This is spiritual maturity. This is taking responsibility. This is the vibration **Nï**—the sound of self-inquiry, of internal investigation, of owning your power.

### I Am Emissary of Unit

Today's statement is **"I Am Emissary of Unit."**

Not "unity" (which implies bringing separate things together). But **Unit**—a single, whole, complete system.

When you say "I Am Emissary of Unit," you are saying:

- I represent the whole.
- I take responsibility for my part in the whole.
- I do not separate myself from what is happening.
- I am not a victim of the system—I AM the system.

This is the energy of the plexus chakra. This is personal power. Not power over others, but **power to respond**—response-ability.

The galactic council is not asking: "Are humans ready to be saved?" They're asking: "Are humans ready to **take responsibility** for being creators?"

And the answer is: **Some are. And those who are must step forward now.**

## Practice

### Facing the Council Within

Today's practice is about taking responsibility. Not in a guilt-ridden, self-blaming way, but in a mature, empowered, "I am a creator and I own my choices" way.

**Step 1: Sit Before the Council**  
Close your eyes. Imagine you are standing in a vast cosmic chamber. Around you are **thousands of beings**—star beings, angels, guides, ancestors, future selves. They are all silent. They are all watching you.

This is the galactic council. And you are here to answer one question:

**"What did you choose? And why?"**

**Step 2: Remember Your Pointing**  
Ask yourself: "What choices have I made that created my current reality?"

Not blaming external forces. Not saying "this happened to me." But asking: "What did I choose? Where did I point?"

Maybe you pointed to this job. This relationship. This city. This lifestyle. Maybe you pointed to forgetting your power, to playing small, to pretending you're helpless.

**Own it.** Say it out loud: "I pointed here. I chose this."

**Step 3: Feel the Weight**  
Don't skip over the weight of this. Feel it. Feel the responsibility. Feel the consequence. This is not comfortable. This is not spiritual bypassing. This is growing up.

You might feel guilt. You might feel regret. You might feel fear. Let it be there. The council is not here to punish you. They're here to witness you **taking responsibility**.

**Step 4: Ask the Question to Yourself**  
Now, activate the YHVH vibration. Ask yourself a question—not to God, not to the universe, but to **yourself**:

"What do I know now that I didn't know when I pointed?"

"What have I learned from this choice?"

"What will I choose next?"

Breathe with the question. Let the answer arise from within.

**Step 5: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"Nï"** three times, feeling it resonate in your solar plexus—the center of your personal power.  
Then speak: **"I Am Emissary of Unit."**  
You are not separate from the whole. You are a responsible member of the galactic family.

**Step 6: Stand in Your Power**  
Open your eyes. Stand up. Feel your feet on the ground. You are no longer a victim. You are no longer a child. You are a creator. You have power. And you choose how to use it.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Own One Choice:**  
Today, identify one thing in your life that you've been blaming on external circumstances. Maybe your job, your relationship, your financial situation, your health. Now ask: "How did I point here? What choices did I make that created this?"

This is not about self-blame. It's about recognizing your creative power. When you see that you chose this (consciously or unconsciously), you also see that you can choose differently.

**Ask Yourself, Not Others:**  
Practice turning your questions inward. Instead of asking someone else "What should I do?", ask yourself "What do I know?" Instead of asking "Why is this happening?", ask "What am I creating?"

Notice how this shift changes your energy. When you ask others, you give away your power. When you ask yourself, you reclaim it.

**Stand Before the Council:**  
Take 5 minutes in silence today. Imagine the galactic council watching you. They're not judging. They're just witnessing. And they're asking: "Are you ready to take responsibility?"

How do you answer?

### Applying This Teaching

This teaching is confrontational. It's meant to be. Aquarius energy can be shocking, jarring, uncomfortable. It forces you to wake up.

The message of Sirius is: **Stop waiting to be saved. Stop playing victim. Stop pretending you're not powerful.** You are a galactic being. You are part of the council. You are here because you chose to be here.

And now the question is: What will you do with that knowledge?

Will you keep playing kindergarten teacher—helping others from a safe distance, pretending you're not fully involved? Or will you step into real responsibility—owning your creative power and facing the consequences of your choices?

This is the shift from spiritual childhood to spiritual adulthood. And it's happening now.

## Aquarius Mental Week Context

We've reached the final day of the Mental Week of Aquarius. This week has taken us through the cosmos—Polaris, Cepheus, Cygnus, Lyra, and now Sirius. Each teaching has been about **galactic consciousness, cosmic networks, and taking your place as a member of a larger system**.

Today, with Sirius and the plexus chakra (Nï - I Am Emissary of Unit), we complete the descent through the chakras and land in the **center of personal power**. The plexus is where we hold our sense of self, our identity, our will.

The teaching is clear: **You are not separate from the galactic family. You are a member of it. And membership comes with responsibility.**

The council is waiting. The question has been asked. And you must answer—not with words, but with **how you live your life from this day forward**.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does it mean that Matias "pointed to Earth"?

In a galactic council long ago, the question was asked: "Where should we run the consciousness experiment—a place where beings forget who they are and must rediscover themselves?" Matias (in another form, another time) raised his hand and said, "Earth." He chose Earth as the location. Now, seeing the consequences of that choice—the suffering, the struggle—he feels the weight of responsibility.

### Q: Why did some council members say humanity needs another 52,000 years?

Because from a galactic perspective, humanity is still very young. We're still fighting wars, destroying our planet, operating from fear and separation. Some beings feel we need more time to mature before we can handle the responsibility of being full members of the galactic family. Others feel we're ready now—that we're on the verge of a breakthrough.

### Q: What is the difference between guilt and responsibility?

Guilt is when you feel bad about your choices but remain stuck in shame, unable to move forward. Responsibility is when you acknowledge your choices, feel the weight of their consequences, and then **choose differently going forward**. Responsibility is empowering. Guilt is paralyzing. Matias felt guilt in the council, but the teaching is about moving from guilt to responsibility.

### Q: How do I "live reality as a dream"?

Recognize that the physical world is not as solid or permanent as it seems. It's a projection of consciousness. When something difficult happens, instead of collapsing into "this is terrible and fixed," you remember: "This is a dream. It can shift. I can shift it." This doesn't mean denying reality—it means seeing reality as fluid and responding with creative power instead of victimhood.

### Q: What does "asking questions to yourself" actually look like?

Instead of asking someone else "What should I do?", you sit in silence and ask yourself "What do I know?" Instead of asking "Why is this happening to me?", you ask "What am I creating?" You turn inward. You activate your own knowing. You trust that the answer is already within you. This is YHVH—you become both the question and the answer.

### Q: What does "I Am Emissary of Unit" mean?

You represent the whole. You are not separate from the system—you ARE the system. When you say this statement, you're taking responsibility for your role in the larger cosmic network. You're saying: "I am accountable. I am connected. I am not a victim of the whole—I am a functioning part of it."

### Q: How do I know if I'm spiritually mature enough to "join the galactic family"?

You don't need permission from anyone. The question is: **Are you taking responsibility for being a creator?** Are you owning your choices? Are you asking questions to yourself instead of waiting for others to give you answers? Are you living as if you are powerful, not powerless? If yes, you're ready. The council is waiting for you to step forward.
