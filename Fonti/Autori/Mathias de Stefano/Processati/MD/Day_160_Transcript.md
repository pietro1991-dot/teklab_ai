## Overview

On January 10th, Matias closes the mental week of Capricorn with a profound teaching on **stability.** We usually think stability means being fixed in one place, having everything we need, staying safe and secure. **But this is a cultural illusion.**

**True stability is not about being still. True stability is about constant movement.**

Using the example of the Earth, Matias shows that our planet only finds stability **because it moves**—rotating on its axis, orbiting the Sun, processing through the equinoxes. **If the Earth stopped moving, it would die.** The same is true for us.

**Stability is the ability to move through all levels without losing your axis.** It's not about staying in one place. It's about evolving through constant transformation while remaining centered.

## Core Teaching

### The Cultural Illusion of Stability

**Stability** comes from Latin: the ability to be stable, to be in one place.

Culturally, we think stability means:
- Having a home
- Having a family
- Having a stable job
- Having good money
- Having everything we need

**We relate stability to security, to survival.**

We think: **"When I have everything I need, I am stable."**

**But this is an external idea of stability.** And it's an illusion.

**If that thing from the outside goes away, I become unstable.**

This is not true stability.

### The Earth's "Instability": Constant Movement

Let's look at the Earth.

**The Earth has no stability** in the way we think of it. It's not sitting still. It's not fixed in one place.

**The Earth is constantly moving:**
1. **Rotating on its axis** (24 hours)
2. **Orbiting the Sun** (365 days)
3. **Precessing through the equinoxes** (25,000 years)

**If the Earth stopped moving, it would die.** It would become an asteroid—lifeless, static.

**The Earth finds stability THROUGH movement.**

### The Earth's Axis and Magnetism

The Earth has a **core made of iron.** This iron creates **magnetism**—positive and negative poles.

**The two poles try to reach each other.** This creates a magnetic field that forces the whole structure to spin.

**This spinning creates the axis.**

**Positive pole = North. Negative pole = South.**

Why is North called "North"? **Because of the magnetism.** The compass (made of iron) is pulled toward the positive pole. That's why we call it "North"—it's where the magnet points.

**It's not about politics or control.** It's about physics.

If the positive pole were at the bottom of the planet, we'd call that "North." **It's just the direction of the magnetic pull.**

### The Earth's True Axis: 23 Degrees

The Earth doesn't spin perfectly upright. **It tilts at 23 degrees.**

**This tilt creates the seasons:** summer, autumn, winter, spring.

The Earth is not spinning like this (upright). **It's spinning like this (tilted).**

And the Earth is also **processing** (moving in a slow circle) through this 23-degree tilt over **25,000 years.**

**This is called the precession of the equinoxes.**

**All of this movement—rotating, orbiting, precessing—creates stability.**

### The Crucifixion of Time

If you draw the Earth's orbit around the Sun and mark the four seasons, you get a **cross:**
- Summer (top)
- Winter (bottom)
- Spring (left)
- Autumn (right)

**This is the crucifixion of time.**

The cross represents the structure of time created by the Earth's movement.

**The Earth's stability comes from being "crucified" in time**—locked into this pattern of movement.

### The Earth Moves Through Constellations

As the Earth orbits the Sun, it **moves through the houses of the constellations.**

**This creates the 12 months**—the zodiac.

Some people ask: **"If the Earth is moving so much, why do we see the same sky?"**

Because **the Sun is also moving**, at the same speed as the other stars around it.

**We see the same sky because we're all moving together.**

But over thousands of years, the sky DOES change. **The North Star changes** because the Earth's tilt shifts through precession.

**The whole sky transforms over 25,000 years.**

### Tropical vs. Sidereal Astrology

**Tropical astrology** = the houses the Earth always moves through, based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun. (Always the same.)

**Sidereal astrology** = the sky according to the precession of the equinoxes. (Changes over 25,000 years.)

**Both are valid.** They're just measuring different movements.

### The Point: Stability Requires Movement

**The Earth only finds stability because it moves.**

**If it stopped spinning, stopped orbiting, stopped precessing, it would lose its axis. It would die.**

**The same is true for you.**

### You Are Like the Earth

Imagine **you are the Earth.**

As you **spin on your own axis**, you see the **constellations**—which represent **all the people you know** (family, friends, partners).

You **rotate**, observing each one, seeing your reflection in your relationships with them.

You also **orbit the light** (the Sun)—moving through these people, relating with some, then others. Sometimes friends, sometimes partners, sometimes family.

And you **precess** (do your inner process)—sometimes looking up to the sky (expansion), sometimes looking down to your roots (grounding).

**You are in constant movement.**

### If You Stop Moving, You Lose Your Axis

**What happens if you attach to ONE person and stop moving?**

If the Earth attached to one constellation and stopped rotating, **it would lose its axis.**

**The same happens to you.**

**If you stop moving through relationships, through experiences, through evolution, you lose your axis.**

**Stability is not about staying with one person forever. It's about moving through all relationships while holding your center.**

### You Find Stability Through Evolution

**It is movement that allows you to find your axis.**

**If you stand still, you have no axis.** You float. You drift.

**But if you move—and observe the middle point through which all the movement happens—you find your axis.**

**Your axis is not a fixed point. It's the center of your movement.**

### True Stability Is the Ability to Move

**Stability is not the ability to have all you need and stay in one place.**

**Stability is the ability to BE.**

To be in constant movement. To evolve. To transform.

**To move through all levels and remain centered.**

**This is the stair of ascension.**

### Resonance: Knowing What Echoes Back

The code for today is **Resonance.**

**Resonance comes from the law of vibration.**

Everything vibrates. Everything expands, creating waves. **When those waves return to themselves, they create echoes.**

**Resonance = ringing again.**

**Resonance is the ability to know which echoes are from your own being, coming back to you through time and space.**

**What resonates with you is an echo of your being.**

**What doesn't resonate is a different vibration**—not bad, just a different ringing of truth.

**This is how you find stability:** by recognizing what resonates (your axis) and what doesn't (external noise).

### The Library in Your Body

Matias reminds us that **the library in your subconscious is a cell in your body.**

**Each step in the stairs (from subconscious to unconscious to conscious) is a chakra, a vertebra in your spine.**

**The office of consciousness at the top is anchored in your brain**—the pineal gland and frontal lobes.

**You ARE the library. You ARE the Akashic Records.**

**Your chakras and spine hold your stability, moving energy from subconscious to conscious.**

### The Torus: Your Energetic Field

When you align your spine and move energy up and down through the chakras, you create a **torus**—the energetic field around you.

**The torus is your stability field.**

**It's created by movement—energy flowing up and down, in and out.**

**This is the toroid chakra.**

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit comfortably with your spine straight.
2. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Imagine a huge library around you—your Akashic Records, your subconscious.

2. Recognize: **this library is within me. Each book is a pattern, information, data.**

3. Walk through the galleries. **This is your inner world—the infinity of your mind.**

4. From the main hall, observe all the books, all the galleries.

5. Recognize: **this is the point where I find my access, my stability, my connection.**

6. **My subconscious and conscious are connected through this main hall.**

7. All these books—the ones you know and the ones you don't—are part of you.

8. The stairs leading to the office of light are also part of you.

9. **Everything is me. I should not reject any of it. It all makes my stability.**

10. Take a deep breath. Recognize: **my own mind is where all this information lives.**

11. **Only through consciousness can I read all of it.**

12. **This library in my subconscious is a cell in my body.**

13. **Each step in the stairs (unconscious to conscious) is a chakra, a vertebra in my spine.**

14. **The office of consciousness is anchored in my brain—my pineal gland, my frontal lobes.**

15. **I am the library. I am my own Akashic Records.**

16. **My chakras and spine hold my stability toward consciousness.**

17. Expand through the stairs of the chakras, from the spine up to consciousness and down to subconscious.

18. **Create the torus around the library with your sound:** *Hum the vibration "LLh."*

19. Repeat: **"I Am the Stairs of Ascension."**

20. **"I Am the Stairs of Ascension."**

21. **"I Am the Stairs of Ascension."**

22. **"I use the stairs that I am."**

23. Take a deep breath. Feel the torus, the energetic field, around you.

### Closing

1. Slowly stretch your body.
2. Open your eyes.
3. Return to the present moment, holding your axis.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Reflect on where you've been seeking external stability (a relationship, a job, a possession). Ask: "Am I trying to stay still, or am I allowing movement?" Then, identify one area where you can embrace evolution instead of clinging to security. Practice moving while holding your axis.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel unstable, remember: **the Earth finds stability through movement, not stillness.** You are meant to evolve, to move through relationships, through experiences, through transformation. **Don't attach to one point and stop moving.** Flow. Rotate. Orbit. Precess. Hold your axis, but never stop moving. This is true stability.

## Q&A

### Q: What is true stability?

True stability is not about being fixed in one place or having everything you need. It's about constant movement—evolving, transforming, moving through all levels while remaining centered on your axis. Stability is the ability to BE, not the ability to stay still.

### Q: Why does the Earth move so much?

The Earth's core is made of iron, which creates magnetism (positive and negative poles). The poles try to reach each other, forcing the whole structure to spin. This spinning creates the axis. The Earth rotates (24 hours), orbits the Sun (365 days), and precesses through the equinoxes (25,000 years). All this movement creates stability.

### Q: Why is North called "North"?

Because of magnetism. The Earth's positive pole creates a magnetic pull. Compasses (made of iron) are pulled toward this pole. We call it "North" simply because that's the direction the magnet points. It's physics, not politics.

### Q: What is the precession of the equinoxes?

The Earth tilts at 23 degrees and slowly rotates through this tilt over 25,000 years. This is called precession. It changes which star is the "North Star" and shifts the sky over millennia. This movement, combined with rotation and orbit, creates the Earth's stability.

### Q: How am I like the Earth?

You rotate (observing your relationships), orbit (moving through experiences toward the light), and precess (doing your inner work, looking up and down). You are in constant movement. If you stop moving and attach to one thing or person, you lose your axis—just like the Earth would.

### Q: What happens if I stop moving?

If you stop evolving, stop moving through experiences and relationships, you lose your axis. You become like a planet that stops spinning—you drift, you die. Movement is what allows you to find and hold your center. Stability is not stillness; it's centered movement.

### Q: What is resonance?

Resonance is the ability to recognize which vibrations are echoes of your own being coming back to you. What resonates with you is your truth, your axis. What doesn't resonate is a different vibration—not bad, just not yours. Resonance helps you find your stability.

### Q: How are the chakras related to the library?

The library (subconscious) is a cell in your body. The stairs (from subconscious to unconscious to conscious) are your chakras, your vertebrae in your spine. The office (consciousness) is anchored in your brain. You ARE the library. Your spine holds your stability toward consciousness. Energy moves up and down the chakras, creating the torus—your energetic field.
