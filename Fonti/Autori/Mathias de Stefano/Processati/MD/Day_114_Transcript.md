## Introduction

Good morning. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening to all of you.

I hope you are all okay. Good. I 'm feeling perfect each day feeling a little bit more better. I just wanted to let you know that I will try to , I will try this week this next day to make the video of the 12 systems.

So you can have it.

So let 's talk about the topic for today which is touch.

So remember that we are working with the hard chara today in the physical aspect of Scorpion.

## Practice Structure

So today we are going to work with the hard and how it manifests and generate the touch. I will ask for people to please let the chat for me to know if they are writing or if they are listening or not and to questions.

Okay. I know that there are some people trying to tell me about someone someone 's dead but it 's not the topic. First thing that we have to feature about this topic is the image that the universe is avoid is emptiness that I wakes it consciousness recognizing that it 's mind and that it can create. It can create by just thinking but everything that creates this idea is imagination.

So it 's not being able to. It 's not being able to use this imagination to live what is receiving is impossible for it to to touch to feel. It 's impossible for it.

So it 's not the mind is not allowing itself to live the ideas that it has. The universe starts to look for is to create a way in which it could feel perceive. This idea is not only from the mind. The idea in which the universe does this is not to stay only in the mind but also to project in the outside.

When this does this it projects an inner idea which is the imagination that it has and into the outside it creates another idea. It creates the outer idea , the projection.

So to this image we will the inside and the outside and the inside we call it negative and the outside we call it positive. The positive expands in the universe and the negative goes back and integrate all the universe.

So what happens with this is that all the information that is in the outside come in back to the inside. It 's given the inside of the universe and new data and new way of interpretation of the universe.

So the inside interprets a new data and expands a new one at transform one.

So this starts to create the transformation of the universe , the transformation of the data of the universe. Because basically what is happening all the time is that the same data that once was only one in the universe in the mind of the universe now it 's been transformed by these projections and integration.

So in such a way this is a constant reflection in a mirror from where you start to perceive and understand different reflections from the same image.

So the thing that happened is that the negative and the positive energy is to move towards one another creating like weights and this waves of vibration are the ones pushing all the data in different pressures.

So what happened that when when you put much more pressure in this two two sides start to create more speed in the movement. When the vibration starts to move faster and faster and faster constantly it creates the frequencies.

So the frequencies will be faster the fast movements of this wave and this fast movements will start to make that the waves become particles because of the speed and because they are storage information.

So this is how the first particles appear. This means that a particle is the conjunction of data moving faster in the waves that brings this information from one side to another.

So these particles are the ones that will create stirs in the future what we call now atoms. Atoms are not matter. Basically atoms are the accumulation of energy that is vibrating very fast constantly fast. This means that when the atoms start to join one another creating molecules and the molecules super molecules and then organisms and so on.

Where we will have is different organisms and living beings or structures in the universe made up with energy moving faster very fast. This helps us to understand that every living being and every inorganically structure will be just structures that share information through waves of vibration in different frequencies creating accumulation of energy particles. That brings information data from one point to another.

So this means that even when you go to the microcosmos all the things that the universe is doing is basically projections from inside outside inside outside outside. Constantly that 's the only thing that everything is doing.

So if everything is a projection if everything is constantly in and out in and out everything is done with just that movement this means that the universe is like a heartbeat that goes in out in out.

So we used to say that love is what connects the universe. And of course it is because love is vibration it 's a heartbeat and everything is connected by that by a heartbeat , pulling in everything.

So everything that exists is a magnetic pulse of positive and negative beating.

So what is the goal of love of this magnetism is now that everything can be communicated that every particle in the universe could be sharing information.

So we are all connected. This means that throughout all the universe through the vibration the particles of light which is the photons are sharing information one point to another in the whole creation. And that 's what we usually call the Asahi Records. The Records is just particles of light photons that are bringing data from one point to another through the waves of a very weak color.

So this is why we used to romanticism love and light , but for the universe love and light is magnetism and particles of information that we call photons.

So what does the universe it creates the energy that we call emotion as a way to interpret and leave that data because there is no way to understand that data unless you live it and experiment it and let you feel it.

So this is why the soul , the energy , the signs , the feelings , the feelings are the ways in which the soul and the mind of the universe can be able to process and to live that data.

So the way in which all this information will be processed and storage as information like our own Asahi Records will be through the sense of touch which would be in the in the in the in the inventory system which is skin. The skin is basically the communicator , the translator between the outer energy and the inner energy.

So this means that is the point , the system that holds all the things connected one another.

So why I described today that skin is love made matter. The skin , what usually does with us is to protect today care of the body from the outside. But one of the things that it does is to help us to be communicated in touch with the outside constantly. And it 's storage , all the information that comes from the outside in the cells and that 's why we have we used to say similar memory.

Through the skin we can storage all the data of our existence.

So one of the things , the main things that we have to understand from from this is that it does n't exist anything exist , this does n't exist. Every basically pulses of positive and negative and magnetism with electrical impulse.

So nobody really touched anything. Never. What you perceive as touch is basically all the electrons trying to separate from one another.

So they get mixed and this friction of the electrons is what we in the brain perceive as touch. Everything that we feel that we call touch. Basically is an idea of an interpretation of our mind.

So everything that we perceive that we think that we perceive as touch is basically the discharge of electricity. Magnetism of particles that in reality they are vibration vibrating moving very fast.

So what we have to understand now is that there is no matter there is no energy. That the only thing that exists or the only thing that matter and energy really are they are different ways to organize the mind.

So we are in reality mind organized in a material way. What we feel is mind organized in an energetic way. And what is mind? Mind is vibration.

Is the vibration generated by the thoughts.

So this means that the mind generate systems in order to perceive the mind. What the universe really is trying to do is to understand and perceive itself not to perceive something different.

So the divinity is not creating something outside to watch it. The divinity is creating itself in a different way so it can experience itself.

So this is why when the universe says I want to perceive myself , use this sense of touch to understand itself to perceive itself.

So if touch is the part of the body where we storage all the information and communication with external , this is the reason why we have a so traumatized civilization. Because we were taught that the , that you should not speak about certain parts of the body that you should not show certain parts of the body that is a shame , some touch of the body.

So we have this information and we 're skin that traumatized humans because through thousands of years , our civilization has been living in truth that used to say that to show the skin to touch the skin is a scene is something wrong.

So what is happening today for example with all this thing of the virus , the people is now being a friend again about being touched because everything can kill you and all that information is in the skin.

So at first was the culture then was the religion then was again and then now the science. There 's no one doing this purpose because they know exactly this. No , this is just because for thousands of years it was very easy to handle a civilization through fear and they were so afraid to the degraded systems of fear.

So we are afraid of everything and people feel safe being afraid. It 's weird , but people usually. When they know what to be afraid of , they feel safe.

So the way in which we can work with the skin again to make it a community cater again to help us to remember is to touch the skin again to carry the skin again. And educate the skin to feel. We have now all this aggression , the violence. But this was always like this to people that heard other people.

Violations in all kinds sexually aggressive. Heating people. People that interpretates that even a carousel is something wrong.

So all of that must be educated in the skin. The practice of this is to touch the body and to tell to the cells of the body. This is okay , this is fine. I should not feel guilty or should or feel bad because I am.

Because I am crazy. This is good. Nothing there 's nothing wrong with this. You have to tell to the to the skin.

You can touch your skin , you can touch your genitals. Carousel also manipulate your genitals. And tell to the skin , this is fine. This is only.

And I can touch it and it 's okay. I can feel it and I can speak with the body that there 's no problem on touching.

So the people that have been living. This kind of situations like harassment.

Someone eating your body.

Someone that maybe touched you in a bad way that raped you. In order to heal yourself to heal the information of your skin. You have to tell your body to remember what happened to acknowledge it because that information is there. The information is there and you need to take it out to acknowledge that what happened.

And then you carries the parts that are you touched your own body. And you say to the to the cells talking. This is not like that time. It 's myself now.

And I am doing this to me. To prove that I am doing something good. That I am doing it for myself. I educate the cells by doing this.

Sometimes maybe you need a hack.

## Q&A

So you have to ask for a hack and you need it. In this way the information can move correctly.

## Guided Meditation

So remember that the divine communicates all this information through skin , through touch. It 's not only through mind or meditation. How you connect with the spirit. The way you connect with the spirit is by touch by the hugs by by opening your body.

So remember this. That in order to to have much more relation with the spiritual world. You need to be relaxed. And you need to be relaxed.

In the communication with your body. With your skin. And another thing. To say that do n't.

## Q&A

Do n't hesitate and ask for help. To know to to people that know how to help others. Like people with. Like.

Psychologists or people that works with biodegradification. Everyone that knows this kind of things. They will help you more specifically with your problem.

Okay.

So. Do n't stay tuned. I 'm doing it. Just one thing I will say.

That maybe there are some therapies that we say we have to eliminate this. No. Nothing gets eliminated. Everything is useful.

You have to restore. Recycle the information. Not to eliminate.

## Daily Practice Elements
