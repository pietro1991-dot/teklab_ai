# Day 210 - Consciousness Work

## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you. How are you? Maybe you do not this , maybe perhaps , but I am even sleeper than yesterday.

Very.

So , if you see that I kind of lose the point , so do n't worry. Just be patient.

So today is a special day because we are closing the whole month of Aquarium.

Today is the tallest day of the physical week in the month dedicated to Aquarium. And the topic to wrap this month is the Sun , which is the star of our solar system. Just to remind you , Sun is the name of our star. There are billions of stars and our star in this system is is named Sun.

The other systems are called with other names , series , arduous and so on with different stars. But they are not called Suns.

So the name Sun comes from the Indo-European language where when they say , when they said , the Sun is called the Sun , the Sun is called the Sun.

So that 's the origin of the name Sun.

So very obviously humans call the Sun as the one that is shining. Easy. We can also consider the Sun as a star that creates everything that exists , that gives life to all the things.

So it 's a star that creates the planets and the planets we leave with people. And we have life here , life emerges because of the Sun.

So we can take the image of the Sun being this womb of a mother that is just aging and creating everything. And all we can take the vision of this star as the father that is guiding us from east to west through the path of life. This means that depending on the psychological point of you of the group of humans , the Sun will be taken the mother or taken as the father.

Some people in the world will say that the Sun is the mother creator and for some other cultures will be the father creator.

So for some cultures , for some traditions , the Sun is taken as feminine , as the feminine aspect of this guy. And for some others , like the Romans ' languages , the Sun was taken as a masculine.

So for example the animistic people , which are the traditions that follow the nature , the animated things , which are following the animals , the plants , the rocks , all the things that move in the world. That is the animistic.

So for them , usually the Sun , would be taken as the mother because it is the one given birth , it is the one given into light. Showing us the truth and taking care of us and so on.

So it 's that expression. In the other hand , when we have empires with people that are willing to come queer the horizon to go farther , they will take the image of the Sun as a masculine. But this is only psychological. There is no feminine or masculine in the objects.

They are bounded by polarity but not as sexuality. As you see , for the animistic people , they saw the Sun as feminine also because the attribute of the Sun for them was that the light of the Sun was bringing clarity , colors , flowers , insects , birds and the beauty of life. The beauty of everything is blooming while the Sun.

So that 's why the concept of the Sun for them was a feminine aspect that they created , the reality that made it all beautiful. And in the other side for the people that were much more imperialist that had a civilization , the Sun represented the strength , the race that cut the ground , that makes everything dry , that moves forward in the horizon.

So that 's why they take this masculine concepts of it.

So the same thing happened with the moon for some cultures. The moon was not like feminine. The moon was like masculine because it was the one protecting the people during the night.

So the fend and them in the darkness.

So the fend and on the psychology of the people of the cultures , they would be taken as masculine or feminine. But nothing of that really matters or is taken in count when we get out of our cultures and we just see and look at the Sun as it is a star. First of all , the Sun is a star made it made with hydrogen and helium.

So both of them are doing reactions , chemical reactions that burns constantly , okay , under a great pressure.

So the burning of these two elements , the chemical reaction of them is the one that makes everything to burn like fire. Just parentheses before I start to explain this. I 'm not going to lose time trying to explain the idea that the Sun and the moon are just that are floating on the sky because fear is flat. I 'm not going to lose time explaining that.

So I 'm going straight to explain the Sun.

So I guess I make myself clear in my position about it.

So first of all , just to have an idea of the sizes. This is Jupiter. This is the Earth.

So just to picture the Sun Jupiter Earth. And now this is not only the most amazing thing. The most amazing thing is that the Sun is a dwarf star. Consider a type of dwarf star.

So it 's one of the smallest stars in our galaxy.

So let 's compare this and I mentioned it in a different way. That dwarf there is the Sun. That there is our entire solar system.

So this here is the cloud of orbit. The cloud of orbit is the limit of the gravitational field of the Sun.

So this means that basically the rocks that float hate here. If they get out of this line , they can go away from the solar system. If they are inside this line , they still are attracted by the gravity of the Sun. But all the planets are here in this circle.

So the limit of this circle here is Neptune.

Okay. This is Sirius. It 's a little bit bigger than the Sun. And this is the closest star that we have.

So now let 's go to Rico. Rico is a red star in the Orion constellation. You can see it because it 's red in the Orion constellation and it 's really big. Rico means leg in Arab.

So it 's the leg of the giant. Let 's see the size of the Sun , a side Rico. Kind of like this.

So do you remember Series the constellation? We have spoken about it.

So Series is one of the constellations that have this biggest stars known until now. Let 's imagine that this star here is V See. This one here is Rico.

So this here is the Sun.

So in this size we have our tourists and tourists.

So it 's a it 's very big the thing out there. This is our star , the Sun. It 's only a green of Sun. And this is also star within a galaxy.

So just to picture how big this is , we can relate this size saying that each one of us , every human , has the size of an electron spinning around a proton in an atom within our body.

So what is the point about this? That if someone was thinking that we are important or that we are in the center of the universe and everyone is thinking about humans. Or if you were thinking that the Sun was the center of all things for us , I 'm sorry but we are not. Not even Albion which is considered the center of our galaxy , is not even the center of the galaxy.

This does another star. We are nothing.

So I repeat again. We are simply an electron , an electron attached to the proton which is the earth which is inside an atom which is the solar system.

So I repeat again. We are not important. We are not doing anything in the universe and nobody is expecting for us to do anything and fine because we are just tiny electron. Everything that we do , everything that we are thinking our philosophies , our beliefs and our expectations of the universe and everything that we are doing as culture , education , beliefs , religions , politics , everything that we do.

It 's not even heard. It 's like just a tiny , tiny electron that is trying to call the attention , moving faster and creating a little bit of heat. But that heat will be only heard if it is able to create a chain reaction. If this electron does n't make a chain reaction , you do n't even feel the heat.

And now I will repeat again. Have you seen this? Nothing.

So I will bring all this aquarium energy to be able to start again.

So bringing this energy of Aquarium , let 's think about this. We are nothing. We do n't exist. We are just a spec.

## Q&A

We are just nothing. We are not in the center. We are not important. And to understand this , I will ask you a question.

Have you ever sat down and asked yourself , what is the electron that is behind my right knee? Do we right now? Have you ever thought about that electron? And if you have , have you thought about the other one that is besides?

Or all the other ones? Let 's be very sincere. How many times have you thought about the philosophy that is helping one of the electrons inside your body? Maybe sometime.

I think that once I just thought about three electrons in my body , what they were doing. But the rest I have no idea.

So have you ever thought about how many electrons do you have within your body? Maybe more than the amount of stars in this sky? More than trillion? And now I ask again.

Now you know this. And you have this idea that we are electrons spinning around in life. Do you think that anybody in the universe is thinking about why we believe in?

So this is what we could call an ego killer in many levels.

So why is important this ego killer idea? Because not because the ego is something wrong , but because we have a misconception of what ego is.

So we have our idea of the ego was born only in mammals. Mammals , not even the planet. Mammals is only one species. Only one in this planet.

So why our ego is based in mammals? Because something that we all have done in our life. Is that when we are born , we call the attention to eat. Because we need to eat.

So we start to call the attention of our mom. Like , Mama , I need to eat.

So how do you do that? Call intention by screaming or shouting or crying?

So your mom can know.

So hey , look at me , I need you.

So why is something from the mammals? Because the ego is formed in that moment by the psychology of saying , in order to survive in this world , I need to call the attention to the ones that can give me the things that I need to survive.

So this is why our body , physical body , was programmed in order to be seen.

So people can watch us and take care of us.

So we are calling the attention to others to be seen. I can say the plants has ego. Plants does n't have ego. Ego is something only for mammals.

So we as humans decide on idea , a universal idea of ego. And we projected to the universe , a vision that is from the mammals.

So I start to say , Mother Earth , Mother of Skies. And we start to project this idea of mom , I want you to give me this Father 's guy. Please help me. I need this this mammals.

And we projected to the cosmos to the matrix. But when we see this , the ego is a little bit De.

So now let 's take an idea of what is the origin and why there is a mammal ego. What is the purpose? Because if it exists , it has a purpose and utility.

## Guided Meditation

So let 's try to re-signify the concept of the mammal ego. And for that let 's go to the beginning of all things. Let 's try to visualize it in this way because it 's not like that. But let 's try to imagine.

So in the universe the first thing is the verb which is vibration.

So the vibration starts to create by this polarity , a resonance in between the positive and the negative. And this creates energy. And this energy starts to create a magnetic field , which is the compression of all these polities by writing so fast. That creates a magnetic field.

So now what happened? That maybe one of these positives has a higher charge than the other one here.

So this makes that this one here attracts the other two negative.

So this makes that these two different lines will occur.

So this one can hold these two. Because it 's much more powerful.

So it makes it curled like this and it creates this shape. Where this vibration starts to shape like this. These creates a contraction of magnetic field in which the positives and negative are exchanged to much energy. This conjunction of all these vibrations is the one that will make that this was before vibration.

Makes itself into a particle , a physical aspect.

So to understand it in a human way or much closer is like we have these two waves here and this currents get colder and colder and colder and it creates ice.

Something stronger.

So what happened here? That if this vibration here has lower charge , which is negative. And the other one comes and it 's positive. It has much positive charges.

They get together as the same vibration.

So they go together in polarity and creates a new one.

So this here starts to reproduce through time and space so much that they start to create particles that we call protons , electrons , neutrons.

So and this remember and this particles creates atoms and atoms creates molecules and molecules composed chemicals composed and so on.

So what is this doing? This is constantly trying to find unity. They get together once and again once and again trying to find what balance in between the charges.

Now as you see everything that exists after this is just a contraction of this same system.

So nothing else really exists. Nothing the only thing that exists is basically this strength , this willing of balance between the positive and the negative. This is why I used to say we are nothing because we are just another way that this system is trying to look for balance. And we humans to this , we put a lot of cultural weight , emotional weight , biological weight and so on.

So there are some people or some beings that are looking for this from the spiritual world , the emotional world , the physical world , different ways but all of them , all of us are looking for the same balance.

So all this finds the balance in the moment when many of these vibrations find the pressure and conjunction to create this , this structure , the Toro.

So this is looking for an energy.

So when this finds the balance to create the Tools it creates its own machinery to regenerate its own energy constantly.

So it does n't need for others to find the balance , it does it by itself. All of this is the verb , is the vibration that we call am. And the compact shape and strength of all of this together is called I , me , the subject.

So the concept of I of me is the concept that holds the unity of all the vibrations that we 're spread around.

So through billions and trillion of years , what the whole cosmos is trying to do is to put all the things that we 're spread together , unifying in the quantum level , in the physical level , in the delusional level , the stars , the galaxies , the planets , all of them trying to be hold in one concept , which is this. And we humans , mammals , we did exactly the same following the same pattern. Which is basically to put all the things together.

So to look for this negative , we call it to eat. To look for the balance , we call it to sleep. To look for another particle , we call it to reproduce. But it 's the same.

We are doing exactly the same.

So all human ideas that we can have of the universe are humans. It 's a human idea. It 's not the real universe.

Now as we have seen here , we have three types of me.

Now we have three kinds of ways in which we absorb this energy. One is the spiritual ego. The other one is the emotional ego. And the other one is the physical ego.

So now , for example , the most known is the physical ego , which is the one that tries to absorb all the things that it has around in order to survive.

So it 's the negative energy that is absorbing the energy from the outside.

So that 's what we know as I want to be beautiful. I want to hold the beauty. I want to hold my life. I want to be young all the time.

The one that wants to be seen by many , to be remembered by many. And that 's the normal ego that we all know. And we all have that. Otherwise , we are dead.

Maybe some people have this ego. Physical ego.

Some people have a lot of ego , but if you do n't have it , you are dead. Because it 's the ones that allows you to leave.

So the physical absorbs.

So the emotional ego is the one that relates with the inner self. The one that is inside , the one that relates with the energies of the environment that wants to make the inside useful for something. And that is willing to feel to perceive and live through emotions , through the trauma , through the feelings , through everything that you perceive inside.

So the negative part of this ego is the one that you for sure know , know with this senses. Like , why me? Why it 's mean the one that suffers? What did nobody is happening?

I feel alone. The spiritual ego is the one that goes out. The ones that spread because it 's positive goes out.

So the spiritual ego is the one that we usually know that is invading the others. That is invading the space of others , trying to come queer territory.

So the spiritual ego is the one that says , hey , do you need help? I will do it for you. Do n't worry. I do it.

I know how to do it. Yes , I know. I have experienced. Yeah , the world.

I will do it. Yes , I came here to save you. Of course , I 'm here to help you to do everything for you.

So the spiritual ego is the one that is willing to show , I know much. You are , my truth is the best one.

So it 's great. You can have it because it 's better than the others. Spiritual ego. But these three ego 's , what they are doing , they are just trying to make this machine to work , to create its own energy.

So the sun does n't have this problem. The song thing is about helium and hydrogen. Helium and hydrogen. That 's it.

We are humans , mammals.

So as humans and mammals , we have this problems. I want to be seen. I am the best one. I can show the best , I , I , why me and all these kind of things.

But for the sun is just helium , hydrogen , helium , hydrogen. That 's it. There 's no all these conflicts , it 's spiritual emotional. This is just the ego being practiced by mammals.

The ego being practiced by mammals.

So once we get this , we will know , we will know that we are just another vibrations and electrons , particles trying to organize in a different way.

So , now think about this. If all this billions of experiences and expression of the universe are just trying to find the balance to find different ways. We humans are just another expression of finding that balance.

So maybe we can say we are not important , but I would say this. In between all these options , the universe decided to create this option , Matthias , and you , your names.

So we have to become the best option of ourselves , because we are practicing on finding that balance. And we have been chosen as an option. I know that it can be very difficult to take this information , because it 's really cold. It does n't have emotion , because there 's no man know that.

But it also releases ourselves from that image of us being the kids. And we become I , me.

So now imagine this , the sun. The sun is referring to itself all the time. When you go to the beach and you go to the sun and you kick sand , one of those grains of sand is the sun is a star in the galaxy. Nothing , just nothing.

Do you think that the sun is thinking , Father , Lord , am I shining properly? No , of course not. The sun is just shining. There 's no relation in that way , the universe.

The sun has been shining always and was able to create planets like earth with such a beauty , without options.

So the sun is teaching us in this system that if we allow ourselves to shine by who we really are , we are helping the universe to find the best options. And who is the universe? Do you remember who is the universe?

So what is the universe is just a liberation that is referring to itself. That we can call it mind , we can call it emotion , we can call it physics. It does n't matter. The universe does n't have any problem with that.

Not because it does n't have a needle , do n't care. It 's because it has the best eagle.

So if the universe is vibration , this means that everything that exists , it does n't really exist. Everything that you see and you perceive your experience is not really there. There 's no suns.

So all the sun , the matter , the worlds , the gravity , the the magnetic fields , all that the body ourselves. It does n't really exist. The only thing that exists is basically vibration. Only that.

It 's just ways behaving as particles. If we keep relating this with the science of everything , we can understand that if everything is a particle , which is a wave.

So we being the electrons of this planet , of this galaxy , if we by great , if we change our vibration , we can change the galaxy.

Remember , if the galaxy does n't really exist because it 's just particles , it 's just waves behaving as particles.

So if we change our waves , the symphony , we can change the whole galaxy.

So to understand this , we have a practical example , which is the evolution of species. And not the Darwin one , just a part of it.

So what is really evolution? Evolution is basically a constant mutation because of the sun radiation. As a summary , we are mutants. All of us.

Each mutation in our world is a creation of a new species. And the recent way we mutated is because of solar radiation. The particles that comes from the sun that goes through the atmosphere and that affect the cells changing the chemical structure of our NA. That uses the chemicals from this world and makes a mix.

So how this works will like the microwave. The microwave is like this radiation , the changes that makes the electrons violate so much that they start to heat. Because when they move so fast , they start to violate much.

So this changed the composition of the element and makes tiny modifications that will change the composition of our NA and then it changes through the next generations. It changes tiny things like the color of the hair , the color of the eyes , the skin , some abilities , some diseases etc.

So it 's electrons.

So it 's the movement of the electrons , provoked by the vibration of the electrons that comes in the radiation of the sun in the photon radiation of the sun , the light that changes and makes us evolve.

So basically it 's the light of the sun that is pushing us towards evolution. That is making us transform who we are , is light. That 's why through thousands of years , we humans have also evolved to understand that we can transcend by light by consciousness.

So the evolution basically has been through thousands of years by tiny mutations due to the radiation of the sun.

So if this happens to us in our microcosmos with the electrons on the light , we recognize that we are made of light , that we are the product of light. If we recognize that we have the power to shine by ourselves , we can also start to violate as an electron , making other electrons to violate , producing a tiny mutation in the society in the planet that could change the way in which we are alive in our whole galaxy. This is why we have to let die the concept of the mammal ego.

So we can get in an age of an aquarium ego. Like this , we go now to the alignment , the last alignment of our moon.

So we can start tomorrow with our moon of pieces. Take a deep breath. You come through to mind and concentrate on all the normal waters. Become aware of the physical body , caracinant , stretching and warning.

Become aware of each element. I recognize the body that I have. The room I find myself right now. I think about the house or the building.

I become aware of the seating , the village where I am , the country , the continent and even the planet. I recognize my physical body here and now being an anchor in this reality.

So I have knowledge in this. I take a deep breath , expand in myself to feel , within it and become it fully. I take a deep breath , expand in myself to the room , become it. I take a deep breath , expanding and becoming the house , the building.

I take a deep breath , expand in and become the village , the city. I take a deep breath , expanding and becoming the country. I take a deep breath , expand in myself , becoming the continent , I find myself in. I take a deep breath , expand in and become the planet.

I take a deep breath , expand in myself to feel , expand in myself to feel. I am the earth. In front of me , I see the sun , and I perceive its light , surround me , feeling its heat. I perceive the moon spinning around me , and surrounding my great dreams and Mars.

I contemplate the asteroid belt , the each defense , separating me from Jupiter and Saturn. In far away , your arms and neck chain , closing the system in Jupiter. I observe the sun , and I extend my arms to it , grabbing into between my hands , feeling the fire , the heat , and bringing it towards me , putting it inside of me. I become the sun , I am the sun.

I am the light that shine on every planet. I am the fire of the transformation. I recognize the power of this sun , and I become aware of that me myself , I am the sun in my life , and the planets are my family and friends. I become aware of the gravity that I have strength , and I think about the power with which I push those planets around me towards me for a way of being.

I am my sun that helps the world to evolve , that hug the world , taking care of them , showing my light to make them right , for I am a sun that burns the destroyer 's plants , that wrapped them. Which kind of star am I willing to be in my own solar system? My light is evolution. Only me , myself , can decide which kind of star am I willing to become.

I take a deep breath , and I take all this fire of the sun to make it shine , expanding it all around creating the magnetic field that holds the entire system that moves every planet around. I stand from my north and myself , the stories of my mental health , connecting each one of these plants , my family , my friends , spinning around me , I am my solar system. I know I am eternal balance , I am eternal balance. I am a sun that burns the destroyer 's plants , that wrapped them all around me , I am a sun that burns the destroyer 's plants , I am the sun that I am ready to shine.

I am a sun that burns the destroyer 's plants , that wrapped them all around me , I am a sun that burns the destroyer 's plants , I am a sun that burns the destroyer 's plants , that wrapped them all around me , I am a sun that burns the destroyer 's plants , I take it to the breath , and I start to spread this consciousness all around my body , creating , stretching and warning. In each one , I can sometimes come back here and now.

## Daily Practice Elements

Remember that until March 22nd , we will be activating the mantra I am with them before we go to sleep. Thank you everybody for having been another month with me , and as always see you tomorrow , and the same time , to begin the month of pieces.
