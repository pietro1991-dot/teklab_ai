## Overview

On this pivotal day, Matias announces the coming December 21, 2020 alignment - the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn creating the "Bethlehem Star" for the first time in 800 years, opening a portal for humanity's shift in consciousness. We explore how we are connected not through physical proximity or even shared language, but through vibrational resonance - invisible threads of frequency that link every being in the cosmic network. We discover that language often separates us while vibration always connects us, and that true communication happens not through words but through the resonance of I AM recognizing itself across all forms.

## The Announcement: December 21, 2020

**This day marks the official announcement of the upcoming planetary alignment:**

**On December 21, 2020, Jupiter and Saturn will align in a great conjunction.**

This astronomical event is significant because:

1. **It creates what's called the "Bethlehem Star"** - the same alignment that occurred around the time of Christ's birth
2. **It happens only once every 800 years approximately**
3. **It marks the transition from Earth element (Capricorn) to Air element (Aquarius) in the great cycles**
4. **It opens a massive portal for consciousness shift on the planet**

### The Invitation

Matias invites everyone who feels called to **gather in meditation on December 21** to activate the planetary grid together.

The specific timing and meditation will be shared on **Day 140** (December 21 itself).

This gathering is about **linking consciousnesses across the planet** through shared intention and vibration.

**Not everyone needs to be physically in the same place - we link through VIBRATION, not location.**

## What Are Links?

The word **"link"** comes from different etymological roots, but they all point to the same meaning:

### Connection Without Binding

A link is **a connection between two or more things**.

But importantly: **A link is not a chain that imprisons - it's a thread that relates.**

**Links create network, not bondage.**

**Links allow flow between nodes while maintaining the integrity of each node.**

Think of the internet - millions of computers linked through invisible signals, each maintaining its own identity while being part of the whole network.

**We are nodes in the cosmic network, linked through vibration.**

### Vibrational Links

The most important understanding: **Links are fundamentally vibrational.**

We are not linked because we touch.

We are not linked because we are near each other.

We are not even linked because we know each other.

**We are linked because we RESONATE at compatible frequencies.**

**Your vibration creates links with other vibrations that can receive/transmit your frequency.**

### Root Chakra and Primal Links

The teaching comes to **Root Chakra** because:

**The root is where we connect to the fundamental network of existence - the Earth grid.**

Your root chakra doesn't just connect you to your own survival and foundation - it connects you to the **planetary network of all beings**.

Through your root:
- You link to Earth's electromagnetic field
- You link to all other humans also rooted in Earth
- You link to the consciousness grid of the planet
- You link to the ancestral memory stored in the land

**Your root is your connection point to the collective network.**

## Language vs. Vibration

One of the most profound teachings today: **Language creates separation while vibration creates links.**

### The Problem with Language

**Matias speaks in two languages in this teaching - Spanish and English.**

Why? To demonstrate a point:

**When he speaks Spanish, those who only understand English feel separated.**

**When he speaks English, those who only understand Spanish feel separated.**

**Language divides people into "those who understand" and "those who don't."**

Language creates:
- National boundaries (Spanish speakers, English speakers, Chinese speakers, etc.)
- Cultural separation (different worldviews encoded in different languages)
- Intellectual barriers (educated vs. uneducated in certain languages)
- Exclusion (insiders who speak the code vs. outsiders who don't)

### The Solution: Vibration

**But when he uses VIBRATION - the tones, the energy, the feeling behind the words - everyone receives something, regardless of language.**

Even if you don't understand the words:
- You feel the energy
- You sense the intention
- You receive the vibration
- You connect to the meaning beyond words

**This is why music connects people who speak different languages.**

**This is why a baby responds to the TONE of voice, not the words.**

**This is why you can "feel" someone's energy even if they're speaking a language you don't know.**

**Vibration creates links. Language creates separation.**

### The Two Languages Teaching

When Matias speaks in two languages, he's showing:

**We need to move beyond language-dependence to vibration-connection.**

**We need to stop relying only on words and start listening to frequency.**

**We need to recognize that true communication happens in the resonance field, not in the vocabulary.**

The irony: He uses language to teach us to go beyond language!

## The Planetary Grid Network

The December 21 alignment is significant because it **activates links in the planetary consciousness grid**.

### What is the Planetary Grid?

Imagine the Earth surrounded and interpenetrated by an invisible network - a web of electromagnetic and consciousness frequencies.

This grid has:
- **Nodes:** Sacred sites, vortexes, power places where energy concentrates
- **Ley lines:** Energy pathways connecting nodes
- **Collective consciousness:** The sum total of all aware beings on the planet
- **Crystalline matrix:** The Earth's own consciousness structure

**Every human being is also a node in this grid.**

**Your consciousness is a point where universal awareness localizes.**

### How We Activate Links

When many people meditate together with shared intention:

1. **Individual nodes (people) align to the same frequency**
2. **Vibrational links form between nodes**
3. **The network activates - energy flows more freely**
4. **Collective consciousness shifts**
5. **The grid "lights up" with increased coherence**

**This is not metaphor - it's measurable through global consciousness research.**

On December 21, with the planetary alignment AND collective meditation:
- Astrological energies create an opening (cosmic links align)
- Human intention creates coherence (consciousness links activate)
- The combination creates a massive shift opportunity (grid transformation)

**We don't create the network - it already exists. We ACTIVATE and STRENGTHEN the links through conscious resonance.**

## Breaking Free from Separation

Links remind us: **Separation is an illusion created by limited perception.**

### The Illusion of Separation

We believe we are separate because:
- We have different bodies (but all bodies are expressions of one matter/energy)
- We have different thoughts (but all thoughts are movements of one consciousness)
- We speak different languages (but all languages point to one reality)
- We live in different places (but all places are locations on one Earth)

**Language, bodies, locations - these create apparent separation.**

**But vibration reveals the underlying links.**

### The Reality of Connection

At the vibrational level:
- We are all nodes in one network
- We are all waves in one ocean
- We are all expressions of one I AM

**The links between us are not something we create - they're something we RECOGNIZE.**

**You don't need to "create connection" with another being. You need to SEE the connection that already exists.**

**Every being is already linked to you through the fundamental vibration of existence.**

## Practical Application: Linking Consciously

How do we live as conscious links in the network?

### 1. Recognize Existing Links

Start seeing the invisible connections:
- When you eat food, you're linked to the farmer who grew it, the soil that nourished it, the sun that powered it
- When you breathe air, you're linked to every plant producing oxygen, every other human sharing the atmosphere
- When you have a thought, you're linked to the collective consciousness field where thoughts arise
- When you feel an emotion, you're linked to all beings who have felt that frequency

**Practice noticing: "What links exist in this moment that I haven't acknowledged?"**

### 2. Communicate Through Vibration

Beyond your words, pay attention to your FREQUENCY:
- What vibration am I transmitting right now?
- Am I speaking words of love with a vibration of judgment?
- Am I silent with words but broadcasting connection through presence?

**People receive your vibration more than your words.**

**Link consciously by aligning your vibration with your intention.**

### 3. Join Global Meditations

Participate in collective practices like the December 21 event:
- You strengthen the grid by adding your conscious node
- You activate dormant links through shared resonance
- You contribute to planetary consciousness shift

**Your individual vibration matters to the collective network.**

## Guided Practice: Becoming the Link

1. Sit comfortably, feet on the ground
2. Feel your **root chakra** at the base of spine connecting to Earth
3. Visualize roots growing from your root down into the ground
4. See these roots connecting to an vast underground network - the Earth grid
5. Through these roots, you link to every other being also connected to Earth
6. Expand awareness: feel the humans in your city, also rooted
7. Expand more: feel humans across your continent, linked through Earth
8. Expand further: feel all humans on the planet, all nodes in one network
9. Now bring awareness to your **heart**
10. Visualize your heart broadcasting a frequency - like a radio signal
11. See this frequency creating invisible links to hearts resonating at compatible frequencies
12. Notice: you're linked not just to people you know, but to all beings matching your vibration
13. Speak internally: **"I am the link of vibration"**
14. Feel yourself as both:
    - Individual node (unique, distinct, sovereign)
    - Part of network (connected, related, interdependent)
15. Both are true simultaneously
16. Now visualize December 21, 2020:
    - See Jupiter and Saturn aligning in the sky
    - See the Bethlehem Star shining
    - See millions of humans meditating simultaneously
    - See the planetary grid lighting up as links activate
    - See yourself as one conscious node contributing to this activation
17. Bring awareness back to your body
18. Feel your root connecting to Earth
19. Feel your heart broadcasting frequency
20. Know yourself as eternal link in the cosmic network

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Ve

**Statement:** I am the link of vibration

**Code:** Links - connection through resonance, network not bondage

**Meditation Focus:**
- Recognize existing vibrational links beyond physical proximity
- Communicate through frequency, not just words
- Feel yourself as node in the planetary consciousness grid

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Throughout the day, practice "vibrational listening." When someone speaks to you, hear the words but pay MORE attention to the frequency beneath the words - the tone, the energy, the feeling. Notice how you receive more information from vibration than from vocabulary. Then practice "vibrational speaking" - before you speak, set your vibration to match your true intention, then let the words carry that frequency.

### Applying This Teaching

Next time you feel separated or disconnected from someone, pause and ask: "Are we separated by language, appearance, or belief - or are we linked by the underlying vibration of existence?" Then shift your attention from the surface differences to the fundamental resonance. Feel the invisible link that already exists. This doesn't mean you ignore real differences, but you recognize the connection beneath them. You are already linked; separation is the illusion requiring effort to maintain.

## Q&A

### Q: How can I participate in the December 21 global meditation if I'm in a different time zone?

The beauty of vibrational links is that they transcend physical time zones. While there will be a specific clock time announced (Day 140), the more important factor is your INTENTION to connect with the global network. Your conscious choice to participate creates the link regardless of when exactly you meditate. That said, if many people meditate simultaneously, it creates stronger coherence - like multiple instruments playing the same note creates resonance. Check Day 140 for specific timing guidance.

### Q: If vibration creates links and language creates separation, should I stop using language?

No - the teaching isn't to abandon language but to recognize its limitations and not be trapped by them. Language is useful for conveying specific information, concepts, and instructions (like this teaching itself!). The point is to NOT RELY ONLY on language for connection. Supplement language with vibrational awareness. When you speak, align your vibration with your words. When you listen, receive the frequency beneath the vocabulary. Use language as tool, not as the only means of communication.

### Q: How do I know if I'm actually linked to someone vibrationally vs. just imagining it?

Vibrational links create resonance you can FEEL, not just think about. Signs of real vibrational link: you feel energized or deeply peaceful in their presence; you "know" things about them without being told; you think of them and they contact you; you feel their emotions even at distance; time disappears when you're together; you understand each other beyond words. Imagination feels mental and shallow; true vibrational link feels somatic and deep. Trust your body's wisdom more than your mind's concepts.

### Q: What if I feel overwhelmed by sensing all the links/connections? It feels like too much.

This is common when you first become aware of the network - suddenly you realize you're connected to EVERYTHING and it can feel overwhelming. Remember: being AWARE of links doesn't mean you're RESPONSIBLE for managing them all. The network exists whether you're conscious of it or not. Your job is simply to tend YOUR node (your own vibration) with integrity. When you broadcast clear, coherent frequency, you naturally strengthen healthy links and diminish unhealthy ones. You don't need to consciously manage every connection - just maintain your own vibrational clarity.

### Q: Can I have vibrational links with people who have died?

Yes - because vibrational links transcend physical form. When someone dies, their body dissolves but their consciousness (which is vibration/frequency) continues in non-physical form. If you resonate with their frequency, you remain linked. This is why you can still "feel" a deceased loved one, receive guidance from ancestors, or connect with spiritual teachers who lived long ago. The link isn't maintained through physical proximity but through frequency resonance. Love is a particularly strong frequency that maintains links across the death threshold.

### Q: How does the Root Chakra specifically create links vs. other chakras?

Each chakra creates different TYPES of links. Root creates **fundamental survival and tribal links** - connection to Earth, to ancestral lineage, to your immediate community, to collective human consciousness. Heart creates **emotional and compassionate links**. Throat creates **communication and expression links**. Third eye creates **intuitive and mental links**. Crown creates **spiritual and universal links**. Root is emphasized today because it's the FOUNDATION - before you can have higher links, you need to be rooted in the basic planetary network. Your root anchors you as a node in the Earth grid.

### Q: What's the difference between healthy links and unhealthy attachments?

**Healthy links:** Allow flow in both directions, maintain sovereignty of each node, enhance both beings, can be consciously adjusted, based on resonance and choice, feel energizing or peaceful.

**Unhealthy attachments:** One-directional drain, compromise sovereignty, diminish one or both beings, feel compulsive or obligatory, based on fear or neediness, feel exhausting or anxious.

The key: links connect while maintaining integrity of each node. Attachments bind and compromise integrity. You can be deeply linked to someone while maintaining complete sovereignty - this is actually the highest form of connection.

### Q: On December 21, what happens if I'm vibrating at a "lower" frequency than others meditating?

The network doesn't work on hierarchy where "higher" vibrations exclude "lower" ones. Every conscious node contributes to collective coherence regardless of its current frequency. By CHOOSING to participate with intention, you raise your own frequency and strengthen the grid. The grid functions through DIVERSITY of frequencies organized in coherent pattern, not through uniformity of identical vibrations. Your unique frequency is needed - it's not about being "good enough" but about being PRESENT with intention.

**Reflection:** As Jupiter and Saturn prepare their 800-year reunion in the sky, creating the Bethlehem Star that announced Christ consciousness into the world, we stand at the threshold of a massive planetary shift, and we learn a truth that both humbles and empowers: we are not isolated islands of consciousness struggling alone, but nodes in a vast cosmic network, already and always linked through invisible threads of vibration to every other being on the planet and beyond. We discover that the very thing we thought connected us - language with its words and concepts - actually creates the illusion of separation, dividing humanity into in-groups and out-groups, those who understand and those who don't. But beneath language, more fundamental than words, flows the universal frequency that connects all life - the vibration that requires no translation because it speaks directly from I AM to I AM, from heart to heart, from essence to essence. Our root chakra anchors us as conscious nodes in the Earth grid, linking us not just to our own survival but to the collective consciousness of humanity preparing for transformation. And we understand the invitation: on December 21, when the stars align and millions of human hearts align with them, we will activate dormant links in the planetary network, lighting up the grid with unprecedented coherence, not because we create something new but because we finally RECOGNIZE and EMBODY the connection that has always existed. We are the link of vibration - both the thread and the weaver, both the message and the messenger, both the individual note and the symphony. The network awaits our conscious participation, not to save the world but to remember what we have always been: one consciousness experiencing itself through infinite nodes, forever connected, eternally whole.
