## Introduction

Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening everyone. You say you must.

I just begin Catalan language because I think maybe that is something that people can not complain. In this past days we have receiving a lot of complaints about the two language thing that I am speaking to languages and horrible and difficult to understand to follow. Why do n't you do different videos and so on.

So I just wanted to let you know because from the foundation they told me please tell something for the new people that I am doing everything as possible to speak in both languages because it 's ready for me to make exactly the same video in English in a separate video. And also the energy is different and of course that we do n't have the time to translate what I am saying because it 's all improvised and if anyone have to translate everything that I say we would n't be in the same rhythm.

So it is very difficult and that 's why I decided to do it in both languages.

So if you have any problem with listening both languages just go into the next one and just pass the language and that 's it. Or take notes or just look into yourself. I do n't know. I think that 's the only thing that I have to say.

I am doing everything as possible for this to reach as many people possible.

So this is why I 'm doing this into languages.

So the reason why of course I speak English in this video is because of course I can not well English is the most spoken by many countries. Of course if it would be another language I would try to learn that language to speak to the most people as possible. But that 's the language that most of the people speak. And of course I can not do a video in all the languages because I ca n't.

So yeah that 's it. And of course I can not do a just I ca n't do just in English because I speak Spanish and that 's my language. I want to keep talking my language.

So that 's it. And also I appreciate the people that tells me why do n't you do this or that. But we have been like this a few months already and if there was an easier way of course I would have taken it.

So thank you.

So once said this let 's go to the topic for today.

Remember something else that I almost forgot.

Today is 16 December 16.

So remember that the summer 21st we will be connecting to the to the alignment of Jupiter and Saturn which will be the 21st December the alignment that we call the Bethlehem Star.

So this alignment already started today but it wo n't be but by the most important moment will be the 21st the summer 21st.

So the way we want to have an in a long time again.

So that 's why it 's important this day.

Remember that the 21st will be the day in which we would say comes back the Christie energy to the planet and we put a foot inside the era of Aquarium. This day it would be very important.

So for us in this what we do we will take it kind of like a new year. There is n't way I 'm saying this and I will repeat this every day from now. It 's because the 21st the precise moment these two planets will be aligned together in the green zero of this new time. We 'll be at 2020 8 20 pm Egypt time.

So our alignment. It 's a special moment.

So it 's like if we organize this to the next.

So now take note and pay attention because this December 21st we are not going to be connected at 2020 we will start the transmission at 20 8 pm.

So 8 pm will be we will be all connected here.

So we have this 20 minutes to prepare ourselves for the alignment that we start at 2020. Egypt time. I guess that it is important to share these things because these synchronities that we are living is telling us that our telling us that we are doing what we are supposed to do because it 's all so perfectly aligned.

So I want to share some some that 's for tomorrow for this year that I understood yesterday.

So I do n't know if you remember but once we finish with all the alignments next July I will go to the north pole and then going through the Kundalini of the planet ending in the south pole.

So this trip that is the Kundalini trip will start in the north pole in August the beginning of August and we 'll finish in January 2022 in south pole.

So what is incredible is that I was looking to the eclipses for 2021 and usually we have two eclipses , sun eclipses every year but in 2021 we have one in June and the other one will be in December and both of them the first one the one in June it 's it 's greatest shadow will be in the north pole and in December the greatest shadow will be in the south pole.

So it 's perfectly aligned. Perfectly aligned from the north to the south all the Kundalini path and the amazing thing is that in 2022 there is no solar eclipse which is really weird so we are going to be in the light no shadows to face that year so so everything is kind of aligned to everything so we 'll see no idea looking into how everything is so connected we 'll begin with a topic for today which is the links. First of all let 's think about the differences between matrix and links because links are not the same as matrix matrix is something that holds all the links so we have to understand that matrix is kind of like this room like a network like a spider web that is connecting everything all around and the links are the tiny parts that connect each one of the parts of the matrix.

So in our cultures today we have this concept for sure I have heard this many times that when we speak about links with others sometimes sometimes we perceive a negative aspect of what is linked. We believe that is about the links that we have with other people emotionally sometimes we are we think that we have links with karma so like if they are attached attachments with other people.

So one of the things that we see in this perception of the links this perception that we have that is a heavy thought about the links that we have with others it comes from the history it comes from our culture. This culture is the one that tells us that to link with someone that to be attached to something is basically to be in chain with someone from hands and from my feet. I am connected to someone as a slave.

So I mean the relationship of attachment or or because of a level of power.

So this cultural beliefs that we have within about the links that we have with others says think that in order to be free what we have to do is to cut the links with everyone around like to break these links , these chains and to set yourself free. What in concepts is impossible to break any link is literally possible to break them.

So you can not break anything in the universe and you can not separate anything in the universe.

## Q&A

So to understand how this concepts work let 's go into a historical idea or fact of how we live this links. In history one example about this links is how the different countries from the Americas started to ask for the independence.

So they wanted to become independent from the metropolis.

So the metropolis were in Europe and they were the empires that got colonies.

So the colonies started to to look for the independence and to set themselves free from the links with the metropolis in Europe.

So for example , began United States , began then or high-tech , Mexico , or Argentina , Brazil and so on.

So that 's how they started to get independence from the metropolis in Europe.

So now picture this that when the Americas , the countries of the three Americas wanted to set themselves free from the metropolis in Europe , they just changed the idea of having a king into having a president. They changed the concept of having feudalism into having a parliament , senators and the Senate , the parliament , and so on.

So when the countries in the Americas got independent , they just copied the same system in a different way. They changed the way but the system is exactly the same.

So even today what we have is it 's republics , different from the monarchy of the Europe and that time. We changed that but we still are looking for this kind of freedom because what we really did , it was to paint the chain with colors. That 's the only difference that we have. That 's why we feel that we are still trapped below a system that is above us.

So we never really as a population never worked in what it is a link with them.

So as you have seen through the history what we do when we set ourselves free , is that we just cut some chains but we do exactly the same because we had n't had the practice of how it is to be free. What is to feel free? What is to be myself? I never had this practice.

So this is why I suddenly when I feel free because the chains were broken , I suddenly say okay , I have to go to someone different and attach me to that other one to put the chains in a new one.

So I can feel safe.

So this represent a human being that had never worked in what a link really means. What freedom really means? I will never find the freedom by breaking something outside. That 's not freedom.

The only way you can find freedom is when you are free in what you think , what you feel , and what you do.

So this is why we as humans do n't really know what it is to be free because to be free implies a lot of responsibility on the being.

So now we are started a new time where we begin a new time. With this Christie energy coming with this new era coming and new systems coming.

So what are we going to do in this new time? Are we going to rely this power into a Christ into the new era of Aquarium into a new system? The only way in which we are going to be coherent in the new time is if each one of you of us recognize that myself , I have a part of that Christie energy. If myself , decide to think like in Aquarium time , if I myself become the system that I want to be.

A link basically is the projection of a reality.

So remember , we have a positive and negative , the positive projects into the negative , the negative into the positive. And how are they connected by a wave of energy?

So this wave of energy creates this link , but it 's not a chain , it 's a link of vibration. And this vibration can change into different frequencies. And those frequencies create different practicalization of this positive negative creating different possibilities. This links are not tiny , how to say , I know the ones that get us tied.

This links are the ones that just describe what are our vibrations.

So everything that we perceive in our reality has a link that I have with something outside is just the perception of my vibrational state.

So this means that I am not linked or attached to anything. I am only connected to the things that violate in the same resonance , same vibration that I violate.

So when someone says , I will cut or I want to cut a carpet link that I have. You can not do that. The only thing that you can do with the carpet link is to integrate it , to learn about it.

So when I have a link with someone with some people , I should not cut the link of that people. What I have to do is to think what part of myself is within that people. Which part I lost for myself that I gave to the other one.

So remember that in the universe , everything is vibration.

So if everything is vibration , I am like a note in music.

So this note in music , a midservivation that is connected with another note , that note will sound coming back to me as an echo , creating a song. But if I do n't change my octave of vibration , I will always play exactly in the same notes , the same song , sounding constantly the same. Picture that when you , what you are doing , what we are trying to do is to change our octave of vibration.

So in order to be in another octave of vibration , of consciousness , you have to basically do the same like in music , change your note into another octave.

So when people say , I have to cut the links with others in order to change my vibration and go into another octave of vibration , of consciousness. That 's not how it works because the other notes are not getting used to duck in this vibration. It 's you who is not being able to change that vibration.

So the reason why humans we do n't move forward and we are still attached to those links that we have with people is because we have been built through those links.

So in a part of us , we think that if we cut those links , we are nothing. We just disappear.

So let 's go to understand something that I 'm not really good on explain this , but I was taking this classes of piano , so I will try to explain this.

So let 's do it very simple. For sure , you have seen someone playing the piano.

So when someone plays the piano , usually use two hands.

So with this hand , you are in one octave and with this hand , you are in another octave.

So with this hand , you are playing the melody and with this other hand , when this other hand , you are playing the notes to hold this melody.

So hold the melody. To accompany the melody. Imagine that you are willing to get into this level of consciousness.

So you are in another octave of vibration and you have this other one that is in the low vibration.

So you want to live here in this vibration because this one is horrible and you want to cut all the links with this one here. I do n't want to.

So what I do , what it is , I was living here in this in this low vibration.

So for example , a family that affects with you the love of you because you are the weird of the family.

So you want to just get rid of this.

So you say , I want to cut all the links that I have with my family because I have the life disembarmant.

Okay , so I will change my vibration into another octave of consciousness. And suddenly you are with the family of light.

Now you can be with your friends that they think like you and so on because you are in the same octave of vibration. But what happened? I cut the links with this one.

So I hide the hand and I just play with one hand.

So this sounds basically like 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10. You do n't have to play anything. It 's like horrible because it 's so boring with just one hand. You do n't have anything.

Okay , so it 's like going to the primary school to play piano with just two fingers.

Okay , so what happened? When I cut links with people or whatever , I am just taking one hand of the piano. That 's what happened.

So look at this that you can go from this low vibration into this high vibration. You can do it. But without the low vibration , it does n't sound good. The vibration is always is sharing constantly moving in a way.

So because this low vibration is the one that makes you what you are now.

Okay , that 's the music.

So all the music is the matrix. And the thing , the notes that do touch , the harmonics that you do in between each one of them is what we call the links sharing data and information to one another. This is important to understand that we should not cut any link from your our mind , from ours. If we cut them , we 're going to loose notes and we are not going to be able to listen to the music.

The question of how can I do it , there is no one way. There 's no manual handbook to do it. There 's so many ways. But all of them are connected with just one word which is love and conditional love.

Once you understand that all the connections that exist are connected by love and you become that love , you become also freedom and you become the one able to rebuild those links into a different awareness. All the links are creating the network of consciousness. What do I have to , what is missing in this network , the consciousness.

So the way in which you bring consciousness to this network , to this links , is by asking the questions why , who , where , from where , from when , since when , what for , how , all these questions are the ones that bring consciousness awareness to the links. And once you clarify all the links , you said yourself free and you begin to create the network , note cutting links , but weaving the network.

Now the next part is a task of yours. I can not answer those questions. You are the only one able to answer your own questions.

So let 's go to information for today. I always say today I will speak a little bit not much because I do n't have anything to say and sadly still late. And this is the thing that I 'm having mercury in cancer. The vibration for today is real.

## Daily Practice Elements

The code for today is the color orange. As the wavelength of the light increases its resonance , we can contemplate the orange tones like in a sunset , relate it with manifestation , nutrition and gestation. My vision that gives life to the light to the lighting of the circle chara , roasting at the same time brown tones , like the earth and vegetation , like the skin and organs. The statement for today is I am the legacy of the one.

So let 's go to the light. Take a deep breath , relax the body. I see a breeze , remember that you are on this rock , the holy rock surrounded by this Ford Province and the Ranger , the world , the name of nature. Humans and animals.

I remember the fire within my heart , high given and legacy to be brought throughout all humanity and whole world. Without any judgment , I just take the decision to become one of the prophets around me and to begin their path towards the direction they are facing to. Nor south is the west. Looking to the horizon and bringing this legacy to the end of your heart.

I walk through deserts , savanna and forest through rivers and seas. A sign walk ahead. I see how other humans start to accompany my path. Each time , even more humans , different ages , different villages , ethnic races , and genders.

Recognize they are not following you. They are following the legacy that you hold within your heart. And then you write to a spot where you see it and look at how this hundreds of people sit around you to wait for a wedding half to say to share the legacy within. Take it in breath and feel a bit bread between your hands.

You show it to everyone until you break it into. I start to share tiny pieces with the hundreds waiting for you. And remember that this is your legacy that the unity , the wine , tourism everyone. You tell them that the unity is the only body existing.

The human nature is the meal that tourism everyone. The human nature is the only way to live. Our body is unity and that 's the legacy of the wine. From my heart , I was sound after 18 , this part of the one , in each one of the hundreds individuals taking the whole meal.

I am the legacy of the wine. I am the legacy of the wine. I am the legacy of the wine. I am the legacy of the wine.

I am the legacy of the wine. We are all connected to the unity and that 's our legacy. This is my body , this is my blood and this is you become flourished by it. You remember that you are the eternal life for I am wine.

I am the legacy of the wine. I am the legacy of the wine. I am the legacy of the wine. Take the breath and bring your hands to your heart.

You begin to carry your body or see them how it 's healing , become flourished as the legacy of the wine. I see. I see. I am the neck.

Each one at some time come back here and now opening your eyes. Thank you everybody for being there as always and see you tomorrow at the same time.
