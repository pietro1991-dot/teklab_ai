## Introduction

Hello. Hello. Hi everyone. How are you?

Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

So all of you.

Now from. Egypt here with Malaya.

So for those for those who does n't remember. Malaya was the person that has been replacing me during all this time that I was n't here in Egypt that I was n't Spain.

So since the very first moment until today , she was replacing , taking my place in the pyramid. How was it? Every day was a different. It was amazing.

Is there any experience you want to share or anything that you want to tell to everybody? About , about , can be whatever? Well , it 's , it 's pretty amazing to be able to be alone inside the pyramid. That 's for sure.

It 's pretty amazing to be inside the great pyramid alone because I was lucky and most of the times almost every day. I was able to be early during the morning and I was completely alone inside.

So there was a lot like I reported to Matias every day by voice messages.

So he knows everything and a lot of times things that happened inside were so abstract that it was really hard to put into the words too. But the thing that I did like the basic thing I always did was to become the earth. To connect with the axis and then with the whole grid , the earth grid.

So from there on , like I said , it was incredible. Everything was different. There is nothing I could really point out , but many , many incredible things.

## Q&A

Some people were asking if I was singing , yes , all the time. And also dancing. And I did what I did. What ever was needed basically whatever came.

There were a lot of informations coming as well.

So I just allowed that and reported to Matias.

So that said , basically it was amazing. I did n't expect to be here one month and I was.

So one of the good things that you will remember about the stain of Matias here were the great pictures , the amazing pictures that she took during her stay here.

So from now on , just forget about it because I came back and you will have the same horrible pictures. But taken without magic.

So , okay. Yes , and just one more thing. Thank you for all the messages that you were in the comments that I was receiving.

So thank you so much to everyone.

So she in three hours , she leads those back to Slovenia. Let 's take a look. Just remind you also that she 's coming back because in ten days we will have here 144 people. And Matias with Judith and me , we will be doing the works with the people doing the stay in the end of the month.

That 's it. Thank you everyone. See you in one the way on the other. Thank you Matias.

Hold. Hold , Vegas. Hi everyone.

So sorry that all this week I did n't post any pictures. Did n't post anything but in Spain we had had to say , we had to say , You want to hold on? Lockdown.

So we could n't move around in Spain.

So we have to be locked at home.

So I had a many things.

So that 's why today when we woke up , I just went all around and it was like this barring of photographs today.

So that I posted just to let you know that I am here that I came back. I 'm in Egypt.

So let 's go to begin with today 's topic , which is the third dimension.

So what to explain about the third dimension? Basically that is this is this one.

So this is the third dimension and this is it.

So I guess that you all know the third dimension. You all had experienced the third dimension.

So besides being simple because it 's what we know. Of course that for the universe everything that is so simple has to be complicated.

So that 's why we are going to try to understand the third dimension. Thank you. Thank you.

So to restart with this idea. A dot or a line is what describes the first dimension.

So the first dimension can be seen like this like a dot or a line because basically this dot is the beginning or the end of one line.

So if you put this line in front like this you will see a dot.

So basically you can see this way.

So one extreme of the first dimension is the alpha and the other extreme is the omega.

So if we just take one dot we will see this here. Cutting the hemisphere having alpha in one side and the omega in the other side.

Okay so that would be a kind of the to positive and negative of the first dimension.

Sorry.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay. Well , I 'm going to say that. See the first dimension.

So let 's go ahead and see if this is the first dimension.

So if this here is the first dimension the second dimension will be this.

So this line here is the first dimension but then the second dimension will be the. The forms the shapes will be the figures of the things is the clarification of of the things okay.

So that here would be a square which is the based the basis of other creations after that. And then we have the third dimension which will be seen in this way.

Now let 's go.

So the third dimension what is going to be the depth.

So here we have. Why? How do you write this? Hi.

Hi.

Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi.

Sorry. I had problems today with the English. Yes.

Okay.

So we can say that for example the first dimension will be the height. The second dimension will be the weight and the third dimension will be the depth.

So remember as I explained the first day of pieces. The dimensions are not different places that you can find separated like one to and three separated from each other. The dimensions are only one thing that are measured from different point of view.

Okay.

So this is three dimensions. One dimension here to the dimensions here three dimensions there. There are no places. There are measures.

So as we have here the first dimension and the second dimension , they are measurements of something.

Something that exists. But until the depth does n't exist. There is no object. There is only measurement.

So depth. It 's also the word for profound.

Okay. It 's the same word.

So profound. Profound comes from the Latin going into the depth. Going into the deepest part. That 's the meaning.

So how do we get the depth? We get it by the fractalization of the second dimension. When the second dimension fractalizes itself , we get the depth.

Sometimes many of us in school had experienced a teacher of drawing that the teacher the how to make the depth in a drawing. I do n't know any English the name but it 's a Danish important.

Okay. Thank you. The vanishing point of a drawing.

Okay.

So it 's useful to talk about the perspective of the things.

So the vanishing point basically would be the fractalization of the second dimension. The vanishing point it can be in the center or whatever. We can put it here in the middle of this place.

## Energy Work

So to do to connect the perspectives is to connect this dot with the vertices of this square. And now what I 'm going to do is to fractalize the cube to go towards the place. Do you have the image? Suddenly I cube became like a portal.

I put a little bit of shadow.

## Practice Structure

So the only thing that we just did was to fractalize the structure of a square towards the dot.

So the first dimension and the second dimension got united to create the third dimension. And this is the way which you can draw something with yes , with something that is profound.

So drawing class.

So from where the third dimension comes from , from an imaginary illusion.

So you have here one photo , another one here. And now the one here. And now the one and bigger.

So here with this our structure. We can also see how the fractal starts to make this. I illusion this idea of depth in the reality creates in the third dimension.

So we can create more and more and more and this will give us an idea of depth. Perfectalida by fractalization.

So what this is saying to us is that everything that creates by fractalization is an illusion. Let 's go back to the most easier fractal of all. And the first dimension we have one pole one axis in positive and negative. And we add another two to create in the second dimension the image of a triangle.

So to make it fractal , let 's make another vanish. Vanish in point.

So let 's connect the axis.

So now we have a tetrahedron. First dimension , the line , second dimension , the triangle , third dimension , the tetrahedron.

Okay.

So we can create new points of vanish in points.

So we will have again the same structure inside. We can also connect this to different vanish in points.

So what I just do n't hear is to connect the same dots to expand into a new one.

So this is a fractalization.

Okay. A fractalization is to create one and again one and again the same structure. One and again one and again.

Okay. A fractal , a fractalization is the fraction of one pole of one part.

So this here is like a fraction of the whole. That 's a fractalization.

So it 's when you say two thirds. For example.

Okay. What do you know that is like this? What do you know like this that has a negative and a positive? And a third one that just appears to give meaning and sense to this other two.

Electron , proton , neutron.

So mostly the basic structure. The basic structure of what of matter.

So this one got united and this one here spins. All the time.

So we have another three entity. The for example is one oxygen and two hydrogen water. And we also have this. And this structure here.

Then we 'll shape carbon.

So when we start to replicate this structure. We have the base of life which is the carbon. And here we have water.

So as you see. The basis of everything is just a positive and negative. Positive and negative. Connected.

Positive and connected. And they create a figure. And that figure. When it 's fractalized.

It starts to create a shape. A form. That.

So what is matter? Matter is basically an illusion that is fractalized.

So as we have said , some other times , what are we? We are an illusion. A hologram of an illusion that has been fractalized.

So basically the third dimension is a distortion. A constant distortion of the second dimension.

So this means that the third dimension is a hologram projected from the second dimension. Being the second dimension. This mind that is creating figures. Concepts trying to get a pattern of this concept.

And you start to go deeper and deeper. The mind starts to find different probabilities. Different ways to understand this figure.

So it starts to fractalize it much and more and more and more. And suddenly it 's going deep and deep and deep. Creating this concept of matter. This concept of the third dimension.

And what is this third dimension? Is the tool that the universal mind has in order to experience this depth. This deep concepts and figures. The third dimension basically is where the mind practices learn.

Where the mind is trying to understand itself to play.

Sometimes what we used to say is that a higher being from another dimension , like a spiritual being from the seventh to the sixth dimension. They come to the third dimension and they got in this third dimension in order to be bored. Like this idea of a spirit or a spirit or a soul that are going to live in the matter. But it 's not exactly like this.

So this is a figure that is made up with lines.

So when this lines become connected in depth , they become an object.

So this is an object now.

So when I got this figure and I made the depth creating the object.

So I create an object which is also a thing. An object is a thing.

So in Latin , thing is race.

So race , the attribute of something , the attribute of a thing is all.

So real means the attribute of a thing. That 's the meaning of real.

So basically this means that when we have a thing made up with figures , we consider that real. And we have two point of view , the physical one or the physical one. The physical one is the one that you can proceed with the senses. The physical one is the one you perceive with the concepts of the senses.

So the physical is based on the physical space on the on the on the feelings on the on the senses. And this is to perceive the things and this psychological is about the concepts that you got experiencing the physical. And both of them are the ones that you call real.

So this is why reality something real can only be explained through subjective concepts. Because it 's only explained through the perception of my senses and the perception of the concept of those senses. We usually say realities , those things that you can touch , that you can touch , that you can see , for example , but it 's not the reality , because what you see is basically the photons making a reaction in your eye that is interpreted by the electrical pulses of your brain. And when you touch something , you have never touched anything , because what the sensation of touching something is basically the electrons of both objects trying to not cross each other , so the magnetic field is so hard that it 's pushing , so you do n't touch the other electron.

So logically you have never touched or seen anything. And this is why we can say that reality from the point of your physical and sickle is just an illusion. Illusion comes from russo , that means gain to play.

So we come back to the concept that the mind is playing. It 's playing a game that we perceive as reality , and that 's the dream. The dream is the reality. The reality is a dream.

So when we speak about the third dimension , we should not think that this dimension is separated from others. This dimension is connected. It 's because of others. Without the other dimensions , there is no dead.

There is no third dimension.

So the third dimension is the need of the other dimensions to be experienced.

So the third dimension is basically the need of the spiritual world to be known. And in order to be known , it needs to know itself , deeper and deeper.

So as you see here , the first dimension , the second dimension are part of the third dimension.

So the divine and the spiritual are fundamental parts of the physical.

So in order for the divine and the spiritual to leave the physical , this point has to do the next. It projects itself in the opposite. Creating a new fractalization in that wall , creating a new structure. It projects outside creating an new structure.

So the way in which this divine and spiritual goes into that side is like if someone from that side pulls this note here going out there. And it bends everything like going block and coming it again out. That 's why I compare this like turning a salt. A salt.

So when you just , that 's the practical. Being together , it has a dust.

So here we have a spiritual being. The ones to become a human being.

So it 's not coming a spiritual being and get inside here to make a human.

So that 's how a human appeared.

Okay. I think then now you got it better than this.

So we usually can think that we have third dimension for dimension and fifth dimension. Hmm. But we usually believe is that the spirit comes from the fifth dimension goes inside a soul in the fourth dimension and gets inside a body in the third dimension. This is why we usually think that in order to get to the fifth dimension , we have to go through the fourth dimension and we have to leave the third dimension.

So that 's why we say I get out of the third dimension in order to go to the fifth dimension. This basically does n't exist. And that 's what we know as torus.

So it 's only one being the torus that is doing that from different many directions. That takes this energy and pushes there and blog the merges and goes back and creates another one in each one of the nodes and starts to reproduce.

So this is how all the dimensions work.

So what we can understand about the third dimension is that the third dimension is the sensitive , the senatorial aspect filling of all the dimensions.

So this means that the third dimension is the only aspect of the reality where all the other dimensions can experience its own creation.

So as you have seen here , it 's not a being there that creates this reality for us to experience this. It 's ourselves in other realities that bend the time and space to create us so we can experience this.

So that 's why the third dimension is the fruit of all this creation. And if we do n't leave plainly the third dimension , we are not going to be able to transcend into other dimensions. Because the only way in which a being from other dimension can become someone in a different dimension is if all the entire being is rebounded in perfectly in harmony in that dimension. That 's why we have to learn how to love the third dimension.

We have to learn how to enjoy the five senses to learn how to enjoy the reality. As much I enjoy this reality much more I will perceive the other realities. And the way in which I am fully aware of this is if I enjoy life being coherent in between what I think , what I feel , what I do. Otherwise I will be only experiencing pleasure in one of the three.

So to feel full is to be coherent.

So when we think that the fifth dimension is coming and we have to go to the fifth dimension is a religious thought. It 's something that we inherited from the monotistic cultures. They were expecting for a savior. They were expecting for a heaven , a paradise , because they are suffering this reality and they do n't like this reality.

Because we are trapped in this reality and this is like a punishment. And this is not a punishment. This is an experience.

So if we leave like that we will suffer that. The idea of the fifth dimension and the age of Aquarium being this paradise is something created in the 60s basically that projected that idea of Aquarium age and the fifth dimension be like this paradise of beautiful things and it 's not. It wo n't be like that. The fifth dimension is not like that.

Aquarium time wo n't be like that.

So if we do n't start to enjoy the third dimension and to live fully the third dimension we will still suffer the third dimension.

So as I wrote today as the poet Calderon de la Barca set enjoy life I say this enjoy life because life is a dream and the dreams are dreams.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the alignment. The vibration for today is lame. The statement for today is I am real lot. The code for today is to be born related with the expression of the universe and spring on earth.

All living beings go through this process of the four universal foundations that starts that start on the stage of life that we call being born. It starts in the moment when the primate sort and the oval the egg united and continues until the seventh years and until the seventh year. When the charts have properly formed in all the physical and and cyclical systems.

Remember that the mantra for this month is I believe. The mantra for today is I believe because remember that the leaf is related with the love I have for things. See the comfort double close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing. I take a deep breath and I become aware of the body and the space I find myself in.

I take a deep breath and I start to imagine how I push the walls through the roof and the floor of this room I find myself in. Expand in it in every direction. Opening it towards the infinite. Expand in this space.

Fill in the void of the universe. In this space I feel irritating. Cow and harmony. Like in a dream.

I start to use my imagination to bring back all the things that I am attached to. Physical things of my life not only now but since I was a child. All the objects from home. Toys , games , clothes , are n't.

Electronic devices , books , pictures. And I recognize that this attachment is not negative. This is the link of love that I feel or felt for each one of them. I take all these objects I feel love for.

I feel good memories of them. And I put them all inside the house of my dreams. The place where I feel at home. Imagine that house , fill up with all these things.

And I see with my imagination how this huge black space turns into this beautiful , the place of my dreams. I walk around the house and join you in space , touching every object , watching every small and feeling the touch. I feel all the sensations of the feelings , emotions that produce my senses. I feel very good memories of my dreams.

I feel very good memories of my dreams. I feel very good memories of my dreams. That all of it , every tree , every wall , every object that I am touching. I made of the unconditional love of the universe.

The chest , it has been limited in different shapes. But even though they are still love. I did out of the house now. And I start to see all the sightseeing , changing trees , mountains , cities.

I think about every person , family , friend. The population , cars , roads , buildings , houses. I see also the garbage , the fighting , the war. I see all the things equally , taking a deep breath , remembering that all those objects are things of the world , our unconditional love , track to light in many shapes , experiencing the love in a limited way.

But even though this love , break of nice and take a deep breath. And I hear a sound , they break high , activating this love that lives in everything. I am the real love. I am the real love.

And I believe that I can feel it in all the things of this world. I believe I believe I believe. And I set my attention to live truly this third dimension , realizing that all the things , even the dark ones , are part of the real love. And I believe that all the things , even the dark ones , are part of the real love.

And I believe that all the life is a dream. For all the life is a dream. Life is a lovely dream. I believe that all the life is a dream.

Take a deep breath , expand yourself , and each one at some time , come back here and now. And I believe that all the life is a dream. Thank you everybody for being here as always. I 'm gon na see you tomorrow , at the same time.
