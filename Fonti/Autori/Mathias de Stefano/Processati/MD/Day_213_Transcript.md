# Day 213 - The Third Dimension: The Reality We Experience

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Throat
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Mental Week
- **Main Topic:** The Third Dimension - Depth, Fractalization, and the Illusion of Matter
- **Vibration:** `Me`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Portal of Truth`
- **Code:** Being born, related with the expression of the universe aspiring on earth. All living beings go through this process of the four universal foundations that starts on the stage of life that we call being born. It starts in the moment when the sperm and the egg unite and continues until the seventh year, when the chakras have properly formed in all the physical and psychological systems.

## Overview

We have explored the first dimension (polarity, the line) and the second dimension (shapes, design, imagination). Today we arrive at the third dimension—the one we know most intimately because we are living it right now.

The third dimension is **this**. It is the physical reality you can touch, see, and experience with your senses. It is the world of matter, form, substance, and depth.

Yet despite being so familiar, the third dimension is actually the most complex to understand. As Matias says, "For the universe, everything that is simple has to be complicated." What appears solid and real is actually an illusion created through **fractalization**—the multiplication and deepening of second-dimensional patterns.

This teaching connects to the **throat chakra**, the center of truth and expression. The throat speaks what is real, what is manifest, what can be named and expressed in physical form. Understanding the third dimension is understanding how spirit becomes matter, how imagination becomes creation, how the invisible becomes visible and speakable.

Today we discover that what we call "reality" is a hologram, a dream, a constant distortion of the second dimension that allows the universal mind to experience itself in depth.

## The Third Dimension as Depth

### The Three Measurements

The **first dimension** is the line. We can call it **height**—a measurement from one point to another, alpha to omega, positive to negative.

The **second dimension** adds a second measurement. We can call it **width**. Now we have a plane, a surface where shapes can exist: triangles, squares, circles. This is the dimension of design.

The **third dimension** adds the final spatial measurement: **depth**. Now we have height, width, and depth—three measurements that create volume, substance, physical form.

Depth is also the word for **profound**. It comes from the Latin, meaning "going into the deepest part." When we speak of something profound, we are speaking of something that has depth, that goes beneath the surface, that extends inward toward essence.

### Dimensions Are Measurements, Not Places

Remember what we learned on Day 211: **dimensions are not different places**. They are not separate locations you travel between. Dimensions are **measurements** of one reality from different points of view.

The first, second, and third dimensions are all measuring the same existence. They are not three separate worlds. They are three ways of perceiving **one world**.

Until depth exists, there is no object. There is only measurement. A line has no physical substance. A square drawn on paper has no physical substance. Only when depth is added does something become an **object**, a **thing** that exists in physical space.

## How Depth is Created: Fractalization

### The Vanishing Point

In art class, many of us learned about the **vanishing point**—a technique for creating the illusion of depth in a two-dimensional drawing.

You start with a square on a flat surface. Then you place a dot somewhere on the page—the vanishing point. You connect each vertex of the square to this dot, drawing lines that converge toward the point. Now fractalize the square toward that dot, creating smaller and smaller squares as they approach the vanishing point.

Suddenly, the flat square becomes a **portal**, a tunnel, a three-dimensional corridor. The illusion of depth appears.

This is precisely how the third dimension is created: through the **fractalization of the second dimension**.

### Fractalization: The Foundation of Form

A **fractalization** is when you take one structure and replicate it, again and again, creating smaller or larger versions of the same pattern. It is the **fraction of the whole**—like saying "two-thirds" or "one-quarter."

Everything in physical reality is built through fractalization:

Start with the first dimension: a line with two poles (positive and negative). Add a third point to create the second dimension: a triangle. Now connect that triangle to a fourth point above or below the plane, and you create the third dimension: a **tetrahedron**, the simplest three-dimensional form.

You can keep fractalizing. Add vanishing points inside the tetrahedron, creating smaller tetrahedrons within. Add vanishing points outside, creating larger structures containing the original. Fractalization can continue infinitely inward and infinitely outward.

### The Atomic Structure

What do you know that has a positive, a negative, and a third element that gives meaning and sense to the other two?

**Electron, proton, neutron.** The basic structure of matter.

The proton is positive, the electron is negative, and the neutron balances them. This structure creates the atom—the foundation of all physical matter.

When you combine **one oxygen and two hydrogen** atoms in this triangular fractalized relationship, you get **water**. When you create a more complex fractalization, you get **carbon**—the base of life.

Matter itself is a fractalized structure. Positive and negative, connected through a third element, replicating over and over, creating shapes and forms that appear solid.

## Matter as Illusion

### The Hologram

So what is matter? **Matter is basically an illusion that has been fractalized.**

As we have said before, we are **a hologram of an illusion**. The third dimension is a **constant distortion** of the second dimension, projected and deepened through fractalization.

This means the third dimension is not the ultimate reality. It is a **hologram projected from the second dimension**—from the mind that creates figures, concepts, patterns. The mind goes deeper and deeper, finding different probabilities, different ways to understand these figures, fractalizing them more and more until the concept of matter appears.

The third dimension is the **tool that the universal mind uses to experience depth**, to explore deep concepts and figures, to play and learn.

### We Are Not Separate Beings Entering Bodies

There is a common belief: a spiritual being from the seventh or sixth dimension comes into the third dimension and enters a body to have an experience. A spirit descends, gets inside a soul, which gets inside a body.

But it is not exactly like this.

A human being is not created by a spiritual being entering a physical body from outside. Instead, imagine this: a figure (the second dimension) fractalized toward a vanishing point creates depth (the third dimension). The spiritual point **projects itself in the opposite direction**, creating a new fractalization on the other side.

It is like **turning a sock inside out**. The spiritual being does not climb down into the body. The spiritual being **bends space and time**, pulling the inner point outward, turning the entire structure inside-out, and emerging as a human being.

A human appeared not because a spirit entered a body, but because **the spiritual dimension folded through the second dimension into the third dimension**, creating a physical form.

## Reality: Physical and Psychological

### What is "Real"?

When this figure made of lines becomes connected in depth, it becomes an **object**. An object is a **thing**. In Latin, "thing" is **res**. The attribute of a thing is **real**.

So **real** means "the attribute of a thing." When we have a thing made up with figures, we consider it real.

We have two points of view on reality:

1. **Physical reality**: What you can perceive with the senses—sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell. The physical is based on feelings and sensations.

2. **Psychological reality**: The concepts you develop from experiencing the physical. The interpretations, meanings, and understandings you create from sensory input.

Both of these together are what we call "real."

### The Illusion of the Senses

But here is the profound truth: **reality, from the point of view of the physical and psychological, is just an illusion.**

What you see is not the object itself. What you see is **photons making a reaction in your eye that is interpreted by electrical pulses in your brain**.

When you touch something, **you have never actually touched anything**. The sensation of touching is the electrons of both objects repelling each other. The magnetic field is so strong that it pushes the objects apart. You never touch the other electron. You feel the electromagnetic repulsion.

So logically, you have never touched or seen anything directly. You have only perceived electrical and electromagnetic reactions that your brain interprets as "reality."

This is why reality from the point of view of the physical and psychological is an **illusion**. Illusion comes from the Latin **ludere**, which means "game, to play."

We come back to the concept that **the mind is playing a game** that we perceive as reality. The dream is the reality. The reality is a dream.

## The Third Dimension is Not Separate

### Connected to All Dimensions

The third dimension is not separated from other dimensions. It is **connected, created because of others**. Without the other dimensions, there is no third dimension.

The third dimension is the **need of the other dimensions to be experienced**. The third dimension is the need of the spiritual world to be known. In order to be known, it needs to know itself deeper and deeper.

The first dimension and the second dimension are **part of** the third dimension. The divine and the spiritual are **fundamental parts of the physical**. They are not separate realms.

So in order for the divine and spiritual to live in the physical, the spiritual point projects itself in the opposite direction, creating a new fractalization. It pulls itself out like turning a sock inside-out, bending everything, coming out the other side.

This is how a spiritual being becomes a human being—not by descending into a body but by **folding through dimensions**.

### The Torus

What we know as the **torus**—the donut-shaped energy field—is the structure that allows this. It is one being, the torus, doing this from many directions. It takes energy, pushes it through, bends it, merges it, comes back, creates another structure at each node, and reproduces.

This is how all dimensions work together.

## The Third Dimension: The Fruit of Creation

### The Sensorial Aspect of All Dimensions

The third dimension is the **sensorial, feeling aspect of all dimensions**. This means that the third dimension is the only aspect of reality where all other dimensions can **experience their own creation**.

It is not a being "out there" creating this reality for us to experience. It is **ourselves in other realities bending time and space to create us** so we can experience this.

That is why the third dimension is **the fruit of all creation**. If we do not live fully in the third dimension, we cannot transcend into other dimensions.

The only way a being from another dimension can become someone in a different dimension is if the entire being is **balanced perfectly in harmony in that dimension**.

That is why we have to **learn to love the third dimension**. We have to learn to enjoy the five senses, to enjoy reality.

**As much as I enjoy this reality, the more I will perceive other realities.**

### Coherence: The Key to Fullness

The way I become fully aware of the third dimension is if I enjoy life while being **coherent** between what I think, what I feel, and what I do.

Otherwise, I will only be experiencing pleasure in one of the three aspects. To feel **full** is to be **coherent**.

When we think the fifth dimension is coming and we have to escape the third dimension, this is a **religious thought**. It is something inherited from monotheistic cultures that expected a savior, a heaven, a paradise—because they were suffering reality and did not like it. They believed this reality was a punishment, a trap.

But **this is not a punishment. This is an experience.**

If we live believing we need to escape, we will suffer. The idea that the fifth dimension and the Age of Aquarius will be a paradise of beautiful things is not accurate. The fifth dimension is not like that. The Aquarian age will not be like that.

If we do not start to enjoy the third dimension and live it fully, we will continue to suffer it.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing. Take a deep breath and become aware of your body and the space you find yourself in.

### Expanding the Room

Take a deep breath and start to imagine how you push the walls, the roof, and the floor of the room you find yourself in, expanding it in every direction, opening it toward the infinite.

Expand this space, filling the void of the universe. In this space, feel irritating calm and harmony—like in a dream.

### Bringing Your Attachments

Start to use your imagination to bring back all the things you are attached to—physical things from your life, not only now but since you were a child.

All the objects from home: toys, games, clothes, art, electronic devices, books, pictures. Recognize that this attachment is not negative. This is the **link of love** you feel or felt for each one of them.

Take all these objects you feel love for, all the good memories of them, and put them all inside **the house of your dreams**, the place where you feel at home.

### The House of Love

Imagine that house filled up with all these things. See with your imagination how this huge black space turns into the beautiful place of your dreams.

Walk around the house, enjoying the space, touching every object, watching every detail, feeling the textures. Feel all the sensations, the feelings, the emotions that your senses produce. Feel the very good memories, the dreams.

Recognize that all of it—every tree, every wall, every object you are touching—is made of the **unconditional love of the universe**, love that has been limited into different shapes. But even though they are limited, they are still love.

### Expanding Into the World

Step out of the house now. Start to see all the scenery changing: trees, mountains, cities. Think about every person, family, friend, the population, cars, roads, buildings, houses.

See also the garbage, the fighting, the war. See all things equally.

Take a deep breath, remembering that all those objects, all the things of the world, are **unconditional love fractalized into many shapes**, experiencing love in a limited way. But even though limited, this is love.

### The Vibration Me

Breathe in, and take a deep breath. Hear a sound vibrating **Me**, activating this love that lives in everything.

**I Am the real love. I Am the real love.**

And I believe that I can feel it in all the things of this world. **I believe, I believe, I believe.**

### Living Truly

Set your attention to **live truly this third dimension**, realizing that all things, even the dark ones, are part of the real love.

**I believe that life is a dream. I believe that life is a dream.**

Life is a lovely dream.

**I believe that all life is a dream.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath, expand yourself, and each one in your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, practice **loving the third dimension** through your senses. Touch objects mindfully, feeling their texture. Look at the world as if seeing it for the first time. Taste your food slowly. Listen to sounds with full attention. Smell the air.

Recognize that every physical sensation is the universe experiencing itself through you. The third dimension is not a trap or punishment but a **gift**—the only place where spirit can feel, touch, taste, see, and hear.

As you move through your day, remember: **all of this is love fractalized into shapes**. The chair, the tree, the person, the sky—all unconditional love limited into form so it can be experienced.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel frustrated with physical reality, remember: this dimension is the fruit of all creation. Hating the third dimension is hating the purpose of existence itself.

When you long to escape into "higher dimensions," ask yourself: Am I coherent between what I think, what I feel, and what I do? If not, you are not yet fully experiencing even this dimension. Why seek another?

Practice coherence. Align your thoughts, emotions, and actions. When these three are unified, you will feel **full**. This fullness is the key to both enjoying the third dimension and perceiving others.

Remember the poet Calderón de la Barca: "Life is a dream, and dreams are dreams." Enjoy this dream. Love this dream. **Be** in this dream fully.

## Week Context

We are in the **Mental Week of Pisces**, using the mind to understand the dimensions of expanded consciousness. We have learned that dimensions are measurements (Day 211), explored the second dimension as design and imagination (Day 212), and today discovered the third dimension as the fractalized depth where matter appears.

The third dimension is where Pisces' vision of unity becomes tangible. Pisces sees all as one, and the third dimension proves this: everything is fractalized love, holographic consciousness, the universal mind playing in physical form.

Tomorrow we explore the **fourth dimension**—time, process, and transformation.

## Q&A

### Q: If matter is an illusion, does that mean nothing is real?

It means reality is not what we think it is. Matter is not solid, permanent, or separate. It is a fractalized pattern of energy, a hologram created by consciousness. But this does not make it "unreal" in the sense of meaningless. It makes it **sacred**—a divine play, a cosmic game where the universe explores itself.

### Q: Why do we need the third dimension if it's just an illusion?

Because the third dimension is the **only place** where all other dimensions can **experience** their creation. Thought needs to become form. Vision needs to become manifestation. Love needs to become touch. Without the third dimension, the universe would know itself conceptually but never experientially.

### Q: How can I love the third dimension when there is so much suffering?

By recognizing that even the dark aspects are part of the fractalization, part of the play. Suffering comes from believing we are trapped in the third dimension. Freedom comes from understanding that this is a **chosen experience**, not a punishment. When you live coherently—aligning thought, feeling, and action—you transform suffering into learning, and limitation into creative expression.

### Q: What does it mean to be coherent between thought, feeling, and action?

It means your mind believes what your heart feels and your body expresses. If you think "I am love" but feel resentment and act with cruelty, you are not coherent. If you think "I want freedom" but feel fear and act from obligation, you are fragmented. Coherence is **integrity**—being whole, being one within yourself.

### Q: If a spiritual being becomes human by folding through dimensions, are we separate from spirit?

No. We **are** spirit, folded into physical form. The spiritual point did not leave its dimension to enter ours. It **extended** itself, like turning a sock inside-out. We are the inside turned outside, the spiritual made physical, the invisible made visible. Spirit and body are one being experiencing itself from different angles.

### Q: How do I enjoy the third dimension when I feel disconnected from it?

Through the senses. Touch things. Taste fully. See beauty. Hear music. Smell flowers. The third dimension is **sensorial**. Disconnection comes from living only in your mind. Reconnection comes from **feeling** the physical world, not just thinking about it.

### Q: Does understanding the third dimension as an illusion help me in daily life?

Yes. When you know that what appears solid is actually fractalized light, you stop taking it so seriously. You stop clinging. You stop fearing change. You recognize that transformation is natural because nothing was ever truly solid to begin with. This brings freedom, playfulness, and presence.
