## Overview

Welcome to Day 29, the second-to-last day of the Leo constellation month, where we work with the feet—the foundation of our temple, the points where we touch the earth, the horizon where heaven and earth meet. Today's teaching on constancy offers a revolutionary perspective on time, presence, and what it means to live fully in the eternal now.

The speaker begins by admitting they don't have constancy—it's something many of us struggle with. In our society, we've built our reality constantly thinking about the future, trying to picture what the future will be, trying to live in the future, trying to build the future. We live more in the future than in the present, which shows us that we've forgotten how to stay in the present, how to live the present.

Today's teaching addresses the paradox: if we don't think about the future, how can we build it? But if we live in the future and not the present, we don't have the anchor to actually create anything. The solution isn't living in the past, present, or future separately—it's living in all three simultaneously, which is what the Higher Self calls "time detox."

The profound shift offered is this: **We are not moving through time. Time moves through us.** We are fixed in one spot, and time moves like waves in the sea. What we must do is observe carefully in our spot all the things that go through us—from the past, the present, and the future. This is the concept of constancy: being in all times in just one spot, being in just one spot for all times. In Latin, this is "con-stantia"—to be with being, to stand with existence itself.

## Core Teaching

### The Feet: Foundation and Horizon

The feet are the foundation of our body, the lowest point of our physical temple. They are what touch the ground, what connect us to the earth, what carry us through the world. The feet represent our grounding, our foundation, our connection to physical reality.

But the feet are also described as "the horizon"—the point where heaven and earth meet. Your left foot is heaven, your right foot is earth. The feet are where the spiritual (represented by the entire body/temple above) meets the material ground.

The feet hold us, carry us toward our destinies, and demonstrate constancy by supporting us day by day. They are the limits of the body, "those who touch the horizon."

Working with the feet grounds us in the present moment while simultaneously connecting us to both heaven (spirit) and earth (matter), to all our destinies (future), and to the path we've already walked (past).

### Two Concepts of Constancy: West and East

The teaching presents two different cultural understandings of constancy that help us arrive at a deeper truth.

**Western Constancy:** Related to work and goals. You want something (like a vacation), so you must be constant in your job to earn money to pay for it. Constancy means "keep doing exactly the same thing in order to accomplish a purpose or reach a goal." You want the fruit of the tree, so you constantly water the plant every day, take care of it, so it doesn't get ill and will eventually give you fruit. The focus is on the future outcome.

**Eastern Constancy:** Not precisely the opposite, but easier to understand as a contrast. Someone wants to plant a tree, but instead of waiting for the fruit, they observe how the tree is growing. It's about the process—the process of growing, the process of relating yourself with the growth of the tree. The focus is on the present unfolding.

Both concepts are still related to going through time—waiting for something to happen or observing something happening. The Higher Self is inviting us to something deeper.

### Time Detox: Transforming Our Relationship with Time

The Higher Self introduces the concept of a "time detox"—a detoxification from our toxic relationship with time, particularly our addiction to living in the future while carrying the burden of the past.

The fundamental shift: **We are not moving through time. Time moves through us.**

We picture ourselves as moving from past through present into future, like traveling on a timeline. But the truth is: **we are fixed in just one spot, and time moves like waves in the sea.**

What we need to do is focus where we are in the perception of the time we receive. We observe carefully in our spot all the things that go through us from the past, the present, and the future.

This concept—"to be in just one spot at the same time to be in any time, everywhere at the same moment"—is constancy in its deepest sense. The Latin "con-stantia" means "to be with being" or "with stance"—to stand with existence, to be present to all of existence simultaneously.

### Becoming the Tree: Beyond Observation

The teaching goes even deeper than the Eastern concept of observing the tree's process. The Higher Self says: **both Eastern and Western concepts are still about going through time. But we need to detox ourselves from the concept of going through time.**

The real teaching is: **Don't think that the tree is growing. Think: I am the tree.**

Not sitting and observing that the tree is growing up. Not sitting and waiting for the tree to give fruits. But **to become yourself the process of the tree. To realize yourself as the tree growing within you.**

Instead of waiting for something to happen, we make step by step these things happen. We focus in our daily things as a process of growth.

In the moment the tree is growing up, the whole potential of that tree—of being other trees, the seed, the fruit, and the potential of every fruit and every seed that it will create to become more trees—all of this is present. The fruit is inside the tree. The future is within us.

**When you do each day focusing in the present, you are activating the potential of the future.**

This is revolutionary: the future is not somewhere ahead of you that you're moving toward. The future is within you, like the fruit is inside the tree. Your present action activates that potential.

### Past, Present, Future as One: Eternity

The teaching challenges the common spiritual advice to "live in the present."

Often when we hear "live in the present," we think: leave the past behind, stop thinking about the future, just be here now. But this is a misunderstanding.

**Living in the present actually means: put the three times together in just one moment.**

It's precisely the opposite of leaving the past behind or ignoring the future. It's about integration, unity, wholeness.

"When you say 'I must live in the present,' you must translate it into: I must live the eternal, constant, or the constant eternity."

We should not leave the past behind in order to create future. **What we have to do is to use the past here and now as an energy to feed the future. And the only way to activate it is by action in the present.**

Past, present, and future altogether—being with being—this is what we call **eternity.**

This is true presence: not a thin slice of "now" isolated from past and future, but the fullness of all time experienced simultaneously in this moment.

### Constancy as Transforming Past into Future through Present

The practical understanding of constancy that emerges: **In every action of the present, I am transforming my past into future.**

Each tiny thing we are doing day by day is the one building the future—if we do it through consciousness, through awareness.

Constancy is not about repeating the same action day after day to reach a goal (Western). It's not even just about observing the process (Eastern). It's about **being the process, recognizing that in each present action, past becomes future.**

Every step you take, your feet are carrying the whole history you've walked (past) and simultaneously moving toward all your destinies (future), and this happens only in the present contact with the ground.

This is why constancy relates to the feet—they demonstrate this principle physically with every step.

### The Rhythm: Getting Into the Flow

The teaching mentions at the beginning: "It's all like a matter of getting the rhythm."

Constancy is finding your rhythm—not forcing yourself into someone else's rhythm or some external standard, but finding the natural rhythm of your being, the rhythm of the tree growing, the rhythm of time moving through you.

When you're in rhythm, constancy becomes natural rather than effortful. You're not trying to be constant—you are constancy itself.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably and begin with the usual body massage, stretching, and yawning. Thank your body for being the anchor of spirit in matter.

Bring special attention to your feet and ankles. Touch them, massage them, caress them from the ankles down. Be aware of each part of them.

Recognize your feet as the limit that surrounds all your temple. They are your time—those who touch the horizon. Recognize in them the strength to hold your whole body day by day. Recognize in them the strength that takes you toward your destinies. Picture in them the constancy of holding you up.

Set the intention to transform your relationship with time, to embody true constancy, to integrate past/present/future, and to become the eternal process of learning.

### Main Practice: Activating the Feet and Becoming Eternity

**Step 1:** Focus on your breathing. Take deep breaths, bringing oxygen to your lungs, heart, blood, muscles, organs. Feel the heat inside your body going outside through your skin, filling up your aura and magnetic field.

**Step 2:** Picture the emotional level around you as the soul—feel the energy of the soul all over your skin like the fresh light of the moon. Feel the spiritual level of the mind shining over all your body with warm light like the sun.

**Step 3:** Observe your body as the holy temple that your soul and spirit inhabits. Recognize your feet as the limit of your body, the parts that touch the horizon, the foundation.

**Step 4:** Allow yourself to picture in front of you the one thing in your life where it is most difficult to be constant. In your life, where do you lack constancy? Acknowledge this without judgment.

**Step 5:** Allow yourself to welcome the I Am within your temple with the energy of the soul and the spirit. Watch the light come inside through your crown, through your eyes, down through your throat, your heart, your solar plexus, your sacrum, the door at your genitals, the path in your knees, down to the horizon in your feet.

**Step 6:** Recognize the light of the I Am within yourself, your being, irradiating through the horizon in your feet, spreading outward.

**Step 7:** Realize: "My left foot is heaven, my right foot is earth." Feel the connection—heaven and earth meeting in your feet, in your foundation.

**Step 8:** Recognize: "I can be here and now. I can be everywhere. I can become my own destiny. I can be constant."

**Step 9:** Start to pronounce the sound "Sü" (pronounced like "sue" with umlauted u, or "sue" with lips more rounded), activating the light of your feet, of heaven and earth united, arising the potential of being here and now in every destiny.

**Step 10:** Chant "Sü" multiple times: "Sü, Sü, Sü..." Feel the vibration in your feet, in your foundation, in the horizon where heaven touches earth.

**Step 11:** Feel the light shining from your feet toward every one of your destinies, all of them coming toward you, coming within you, becoming yourself here and now.

**Step 12:** Picture in front of you that thing where it's most difficult for you to be constant. See it as a new destiny coming toward you, coming within you, becoming yourself here and now. Chant "Sü" again.

**Step 13:** Feel all destinies come, become yourself. Recognize: "Through all of them, I can learn to become here and now in the present, the eternal, eternity itself."

**Step 14:** Continue chanting "Sü" and feel all the destinies—past, present, future—integrating in this moment, in your feet touching the earth.

**Step 15:** Repeat aloud: "I Am the Path to Learning. I Am the Path to Learning. I Am the Path to Learning." Feel the truth—you are always learning, always becoming, always in process, and this is eternity.

**Step 16:** Become aware of the I Am in your feet—the foundation, the grounding, the connection to earth and heaven, the horizon where all time meets.

**Step 17:** Bring your hands to your heart to balance. Affirm: "I can be here and now. I can live everywhere. I am a constant process of learning, for I Am the Path to Learning. Here and now."

**Step 18:** Take consciousness from your heart through your whole body—massaging, caressing, stretching, yawning. Come back to full presence and softly open your eyes.

### Closing

Stand up and feel your feet very firm on the ground. Notice how it feels to be grounded, supported, connected to earth.

The task: Take a walk. As you walk, you will take 10 steps—one for each day of the journey, one for each part of the body and chakra you've worked with this month.

With each step, set an intention for your new path:
- Step 1: Intention for my new mind
- Step 2: Intention for my new consciousness  
- Step 3: Intention for my new throat/communication
- Step 4: Intention for my new heart/love
- Step 5: Intention for my new solar plexus/power
- Step 6: Intention for my new sacrum/creativity
- Step 7: Intention for my new root/vitality
- Step 8: Intention for my new knees/path
- Step 9: Intention for my new feet/foundation
- Step 10: Intention for my whole being, my whole self

The intentions can be framed as: "In this new path for me, I will..." or "I am..." or "I will be..." or "I will do..."

As you walk, feel your feet carrying you, grounding you, connecting heaven and earth with each step. Feel the constancy of the rhythm, the eternal process of learning unfolding step by step.

Journal about your experience with constancy. Where do you struggle with it? How does understanding constancy as "being the process" rather than "doing the same thing to reach a goal" change your perspective? What would it mean to become the tree rather than wait for its fruit?

## Integration

This teaching challenges the common understanding of "living in the present" that dominates spiritual circles. Examine your own beliefs: do you think being present means forgetting the past and not thinking about the future? 

Try the practice of integration: when you're doing something today, consciously feel how this action contains your past (all the learning and experience that led you to this moment) and your future (the potential this action activates). See if you can feel all three times present in the action.

Work with the metaphor of becoming the tree. Choose one area of your life where you're trying to be constant—maybe a daily practice, a creative project, a health goal. Instead of thinking "I must do this every day to reach my goal" (Western) or even "I will observe my process" (Eastern), try "I am becoming this. I am this process. The fruit is already within me, and my daily action activates its potential."

Notice your relationship with time. Do you live mostly in the future (always planning, anticipating, trying to get ahead)? Mostly in the past (replaying what happened, dwelling on memories or regrets)? Or in a thin slice of "now" that feels disconnected from past and future? Practice the integration: hold all three simultaneously.

Work with your feet literally. Walk barefoot when possible. Feel your feet touching the earth. Notice how each step carries your whole history and moves you toward all your destinies, and this all happens only in the present contact with ground. This is constancy embodied.

Set intentions for your new path as suggested in the practice. What do you want to become (not just achieve) in each area of your being? Frame these as present-tense statements: "I am..." rather than "I will be..." This activates the future potential in the present moment.

Challenge your concept of constancy. If it feels like a burden ("I have to do this every single day no matter what"), you're working with the Western model alone. Try finding the rhythm, becoming the process, feeling the eternity in each action rather than just grinding toward a goal.

## Q&A

**Q: How is this different from typical mindfulness teaching about being present?**

**A:** Typical mindfulness often emphasizes being in "this moment only"—dropping thoughts of past and future, coming back to the breath, being here now in a very focused way. This teaching doesn't contradict that but expands it: true presence includes past and future. You're not dropping them; you're integrating them into a unified experience of eternity. The present moment contains all time. This is a fuller, more integrated presence than just a narrow focus on "now" to the exclusion of temporal awareness.

**Q: Isn't it contradictory to say we should think about the future (to activate its potential) and also not live in the future?**

**A:** The distinction is between *living in* the future (always mentally ahead of where you are, never here, always waiting for something else) and *activating the potential of* the future (recognizing that your present action is planting seeds, that the future is within you now as potential). The first is disconnected and creates anxiety. The second is integrated and creates creative power. You're not escaping to the future; you're calling the future into the present through conscious action.

**Q: How do I actually "become the tree" instead of just observing it or working toward it?**

**A:** This is a shift in identity and presence. Instead of "I am a person who is trying to build a business" (working toward), try "I am a business becoming manifest" (being the process). Instead of "I am practicing meditation to become more peaceful," try "I am peace becoming conscious of itself through practice." Feel yourself AS the process, not as someone separate from the process trying to achieve an outcome. This is subtle but profound—it's a shift from doing to being, from striving to embodying.

**Q: What if I genuinely don't know what my destiny or purpose is?**

**A:** The teaching suggests you have multiple destinies, not one fixed purpose. Every potential within you is a destiny, and they're all coming toward you, becoming you. Rather than searching for THE purpose, become aware of what's arising in you moment by moment. What wants to be expressed? What wants to grow? What potential is activating right now? Your "destiny" is not a fixed endpoint; it's the constant unfolding of what you're becoming.

**Q: How do I use the past as energy to feed the future?**

**A:** Every experience you've had, every skill you've learned, every relationship, every challenge—these are resources, nutrients, compost for what's growing. Don't leave them behind or try to forget them. Consciously recognize: "I have all this lived experience, and it's part of what I'm becoming now. The lessons from my past inform my present action, which activates my future potential." This is very different from being trapped in the past (replaying it endlessly, unable to move) or trying to escape it (spiritual bypassing, pretending it didn't happen).

**Q: I struggle with constancy because I get bored doing the same thing every day. Does this teaching help with that?**

**A:** Yes! The Western model of constancy (doing the exact same thing every day to reach a goal) IS boring because you're disconnected from the process, just grinding through to an outcome. If you shift to becoming the process, finding the rhythm, and recognizing that each day is different even when the action is the same (the tree is different today than yesterday, even though it's the same tree growing), it becomes alive rather than repetitive. Also, constancy doesn't mean rigidity—it means being with being, which includes adaptation, responsiveness, and organic unfolding.

**Q: What's the relationship between constancy and discipline?**

**A:** Discipline (from the same root as "disciple"—one who learns) is about choosing to show up to the learning process. Constancy is recognizing that you ARE the process. Discipline might be needed at first to establish the rhythm, but true constancy transcends discipline—it becomes natural, who you are, not something you're forcing yourself to do. When you're truly constant (in the deeper sense of this teaching), you don't need discipline because you're being yourself, and being yourself is effortless.

**Q: How can I be in all times at once? That sounds overwhelming or impossible.**

**A:** It's not about your mind holding all past and future events simultaneously (that would be overwhelming). It's about the quality of presence—being so fully here that past and future are both available in this moment. Your body already does this: it carries your entire history (cellular memory, learned patterns, scars, skills) and contains your future potential (what you're becoming, what wants to emerge). You're not trying to DO anything; you're recognizing what already IS. The overwhelm comes from trying to control or manage time. The freedom comes from recognizing you're the space through which time moves.

*May your feet be firmly planted on the earth and connected to heaven. May you find your rhythm and become the eternal process of learning. May past, present, and future integrate in each step you take. I Am the Path to Learning.*
