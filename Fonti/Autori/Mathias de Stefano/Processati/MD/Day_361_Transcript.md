## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra:** `Heart`

## Introduction

Hi everyone , good afternoon , good evening. I hope this find you well after another 360 days of consciousness. This path of consciousness. I lose the track of how to do this daily transmission.

Please be patient with me. As you 've seen , I 've been much more inside of me , like not doing many things outside. This is because I have been much more working on working on many things that are coming in the future after our year in 11 , 11 , in Argentina. This is one of the things that I want to share with all of you.

In this days out of time , we can create it all together. First of all , remind you what is the days out of time.

So people that has joined us recently , maybe you do n't know what we 're talking about , so I would like to explain a little bit.

So the reason why this five days out of time is because we 're following the Syrian ear. The Syrian ear means that we are following the moment of the rising of the star 's serious in horizon , in the latitude 33 north. Why is that? Because after six months of disappearing from the north , the star of serious appears again every year in the latitude 33 north.

Sorry , it appears again. And in the latitude 33 north , where our ancestors in civilizations like Atlanta civilizations , where it spread , they celebrated the new ear in that moment when in that latitude 33 north , the star of serious appears again.

So that for them means the new ear.

So we started to count the new year from that moment following the ancient calendar.

So it 's very difficult to understand when a year begins. Let 's remember this because the ear is like a static.

So it 's impossible to determine which moment which latitude or which meridian the year starts. It 's impossible to say something much more psychological than real.

So that 's why every culture chooses a different moment , a different moment of the year , according to their own culture. It could be a solstice , an equinox. It could be any latitude , any moment , and any place.

So that 's why we choose 33 north latitude because we created this path of the AM in Egypt , which is in Cairo 33 , 31 33 latitude.

So in that area of the planet is where the star 's serious appears again.

So that 's why we choose that moment to start the year because also those are the civilizations that work for consciousness.

So remember that what we are doing from that moment of his four or five , we start to count from that day 360 days of consciousness. I mean the whole year , the whole sphere , every day is a degree in the circle , which is 360 degrees.

So each day is a degree.

So we are going to divide it in 12 months of 30 days each , which are divided in three weeks of 10 days each.

So the whole conscious year , all together.

## Practice Structure

So that 's the perfect circle , and that 's why we are going to work with every day with a different topic. This is something that we are going to , that we are going to keep on going the whole time.

So because once you finish the 360 , you have five days more.

So those other five days are celebrated as the days out of time because you do n't know where to put them.

So that 's why the ancient put them all together and created the days out of time and celebrated each day for a god , like a new beginning and a new year.

So for us , it would be the days of fire , earth , ether , water and air , the elements.

So this is why every year we are going to celebrate this five days out of time and the 360 days to work in our access in coherence.

So from now on , from this fourth , I was fourth , every post of every day wo n't be published in my social media. I will stop sharing that in my own social media.

So everything that is the year of the I am will be posted in the Instagram and Facebook of the I am. We have that social media , which I will share in stories all the time , of course , but the post wo n't be in my social media. We 'll be only there.

So if you want to keep on going with the daily activation , the daily topics to remind you and stuff.

So you can have it all there.

So you want to miss it and it will be all like aligned.

So you can keep the track.

Okay. But of course , the days out of time , we will be together. We will do an alignment or something to integrate the whole year again.

So this will be like a tradition for us , the celebration of this five days. And of course , the topics of each one of the days will be something to remind us constantly. What do we have to do to get balance to find the access every day.

Okay.

So it 's our tradition for the years. Always. Of course , that eventually I will start to pose more conversations with the I am and so on , but all of them will be connected to the first idea that we have shared all together in 2020 and 2021.

So in between all this that I 'm sharing about the year , I wanted to share with you also three use that I 'm glad about that I want to share with all of you , which are the projects that we are going to do. What I wanted to do is to what I will do is to share this during the five days.

So we can manifest it to so these for the future in this days out of time. Because these days out of time are like intentions for to sew the things that are about to come. I have it all the reason because otherwise I will forget.

So first of all , I remind you that for that there is space to you have side to for still for fire group in capital Monte. I remind you that we will try to close the whole group of fire by the end of August.

So I suggest for you to join us as an answer. I wanted to share that , too. All of them are not in water , but all of them are in water and they are in the fire. Until now , the fourth of August , until the year , all of them are in these 10 , we are going to participate in this workshop , the 13th August , which is from the Atlantic Commission.

The idea of the Atlantic Commission is to explain it a little of the philosophy of what are the specific points of what was worked in Atlantic , for the consumption changes , how they develop and so on.

So , we are going to prepare for the 11th , which we explained the 13th of August.

So , I will explain that in the next 4th of August , I will be able to participate in this workshop , which we will give all the 13th August. For those who join the group fire , those who subscribe until August 4th , so the beginning of the year , during these whole days , they are at the time , all the people that has been subscribed already and the people that are subscribing right now , until August 4th , you will be able to access to the Atlantic Como Vision , the workshop that I will give in August 13th.

So , all these people can , we will have access to this workshop , August 13th regarding about the whole Atlantic , the Atlantic Vision of Atlantic Path , the topics that maybe you have to know for everyone of them , of the path that we are going to do together and so on. I encourage you to do this as soon as possible.

So , another thing that I wanted to remind you , is that we have said for the beginning of this year , that everyone that is from the fire and water group , fire and water group that has gone to Egypt and will come to Argentina , both countries , both groups. All together , you will be able to access to the Aryan course , which is like a course to become an Aryan , that I will give in 2023 along some months.

So , I will give this course , so everyone who has gone to fire and water group in Egypt , on Argentina , this November , all together online , you will have the access to go to this course during 2023.

Okay? That we will prepare for you.

So , that 's the second thing. The news that I wanted to share with all of you that I am happy to , to tell you , is that we are working in shaping the idea of the university , which will be physical and online for everyone , and this university will be called , which is for OntoCrasi. And it would be an university to improve , to learn , to go deeper into all the knowledge of all the topics in the I. M.

Meaning that not only me , but many other people will be teaching , information courses , long courses along the whole year , and many years , and for all of you to get ready to prepare in all the topics that you would like.

So , we will share with all of you , much more information about this. We are working in all this , and this will start in 2024.

So , we have plenty of time to work in shape it , but the idea is to , for everyone to have access to this information , to get prepared , and also to put in order all that information. The thing that I like the most about this idea is to put all this courses that usually people peaks from very different places.

So , the idea of the university is to make a curriculum from all this , like put it in order.

So , you can find it in a proper way , you can find all the knowledge and people teaching all this in a way that you can understand how it all connects.

So , you do n't have to pick things around , and everyone can share this information in this space. And the other news that I wanted to share with you , regarding this university idea , is to , is for all of you who are going to be physically in , that has been physically needed , and will be physically in Argentina , is November. All those , we are going to call you that , foundational seats.

So , you are going to be the part of the people that is founding this university.

So , you will receive a certificate saying that you are a founder seat of the university on to us , and you are helping us.

So , your names will be in the , in the physical place with the actual names , like a , founders , I do n't know in English , how it 's said , that the founders played something like this , you will have your name there as a founder seat of the university.

So , because you physically were there to actually help us , to make this possible. And there is some foundation to , to sew a new humanity.

So , the founders , the actual founders , will be those who are physically there.

So , the four groups , air , air , fire , and water. Thank you all for being a member of the foundation. Thank you all for being , physically in our gatherings , because you are helping us to give birth to this idea , and to the spirit of this university , the on to university.

So , we will be sharing more information about the university , when we have more data. But , as I said , you can join to be part of this until this November.

So , join the gathering in November , where we are closing in the whole idea of this project , and to start with a new time , with a new project of on-to-use. Once said , all this , let 's go to the alignment , which is to connect the information for fire today.

## Guided Meditation

We are going to integrate all the path of fire in a meditation , and the same thing , we will do each one of these days.

We are going to join the journey , or the journey , or the high. Let 's remember that the name 's fire , the path of fire has its ability , which is the month of areas , month of Rio , and month of Sagittarius.

## Q&A

So , we will integrate this free asked in ourselves , which is areas with arc , the divine spark , Leo , which is the fire itself , and Sagittarius , which is the light and the heat. Did you know for example , start to make your body stretch your body from your feet , till your head , and then you will be able to do it. I will explain the right position , tell your body , deep breathing , feel what is the position that your body needs in this moment , and we will close our eyes , take a deep breath , we concentrate in our breathing through our nose , I take a deep breath , feel in the air , entering my lungs , I become aware that with every breath that I take , I am softly lowering the spark that lives in me , the divine spark in my heart , but I perceive the breathing , the air , I feel how the air goes to the lung , and from there to my heart , ignite in sparks of colors , that fill up my veins and air through you. This spark is the beam that I call I , me , the beam that emerges that exists , to question , to find the answers along the whole universe , the world , existence.

## Guided Meditation

The spark is the ego , the self that is looking for itself , is intention to find yourself. I breathe every time faster , bring in life to this part , ignite in it , from within this ear , in the heart where the spirit finds the soul , and manifests in the body. The spirit is the inspiration that moves the soul to ignite the body.

## Q&A

Remember , this part is the question , the question that takes us to initiate the path. I honor the question. I become aware that is the question that brought me here , not the answer. There is no answer , no truth , knowledge or wisdom , without questioning.

## Guided Meditation

There is no strength without movement. There is no purpose without our beginning. I breathe faster , and I observe the sparks turning into fire. The divine spark of color turned into flames.

From my heart , the spirit ignites into a flame , in the color yellow , but avalanche , which expands with 19 the flame of the soul , in a beautiful pink color. And both of them are surrounded by a beautiful blue flame. Representing the will of my body. The trying flame ignites in me.

I am wisdom , I am love , I am will , and I recognize that I am my twin flame. I am alive , blue flame , and a pink flame , that ignites my merhaba , the vehicle of light. The I am , I remember , I am the light , I am the way , I am the truth , I am love , I am why I am. I observe myself turning into fire , igniting the whole beginning.

And I expand this heat , this light to the world. I recognize that I am the heart of the world , the core of the planet. And the heat that manages from me , gives life to all existence. I expand my body throughout the volcanoes , creating the tectonic plates , the past , the fire of my body , forges , the minerals of the world , manifest in the continent and the oceans.

My body turns into the earth , and my fire flows throughout each volcano , the ring of fire , the Kundalini , the snake , the dragon of light , and in me , ignites Africa. Oceania , Asia , Europe , North America , South America , Antarctica , and my fire ignite in the hills of the oceans. And the oceans , sorry , I am the heart of the world , and I am the heart of the world , and I am the heart of the world , and the oceans , sorry , night me , Arctic , Atlantic , Indian , Pacific , Antarctic. The Kundalini of the world ignites me , emanating life , heat , light , I am the divine spark , I am the sacred fire , I am the light of the world , I am fire.

I take it , breath , I take it , breath , and start to move my body like the fire , stretching , and bringing the light and the heat , throughout the entire physical body , coming back here and now. Thank you , everyone , for having walked along us another year of consciousness. And thank you for being here and now , and anchor the spirit of the fire. I am fire.

Press the heat , see you tomorrow , at the same time , to activate the earth.
