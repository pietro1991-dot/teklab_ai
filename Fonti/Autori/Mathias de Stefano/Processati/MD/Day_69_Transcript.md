## Introduction

Hi everyone , so welcome another day this time for the ankles related to the mind , the week of the mind in the mouth of Libre.

So we have on the one day left to end up with the mind week. I felt like this week was like very very fast.

## Q&A

So before we start I just wanted to tell all of you the those who are joining us for the first time that if you have any questions , any doubts or anything about what we are doing and so on , you can go to the blog which is josoid. Red. Joshi is I am in Spanish and red does n't mean the color red it means network in Spanish.

So look for that and there you would have all information of everything that you need to know to know what we mean.

Today when I was in the pyramid the information that was shown was about meaning and nonsense.

So since and no sense.

So this concept I wrote about this concept in the blog but as always I would try to make a summary of this topic so we could all be in the same page while doing the alignment. For sure you have felt through your life and maybe in this moment the feeling of nonsense that nothing has since it 's like not only the spiritual things that we are doing every day but also our life like job friends life society anything and suddenly when I go deeper into the into acknowledging the universe and how it works suddenly everything has even less meaning like nothing really has a meaning.

So suddenly what we do is to try to is to think that anything we do in our life is really real and that we usually when we get into know the universe and we know that kind of anything really exists suddenly we say so what is the purpose of everything what why do we do what we do if nothing have really meaning and you feel like a void.

Some of you maybe know this process like the dark oh maybe you have heard that that sentence that name some day before but the thing is that there are many moments and each one of these moments are different in which we kind of feel this nonsense of reality. In these different moments one of the first one that we may feel is the one that when we work in our lives and and suddenly we try to do everything as the society is telling for us to do and to earn for some holidays and to try to put the story together and to try to to be as everyone says that is better to be so suddenly we stop and say wait a moment what is the the meaning of this what is the point of all this and suddenly you realize that life as you was as you were living it has no meaning so sometimes we just stop living that life and we start to seek for our dreams to give a new meaning to our lives and trying to to give a purpose to it a different idea of what life means.

So that is the moment when I recognize myself capable to live my dreams or to live different realities in the world not the ones that I 've been said to.

So imagine that when you achieve the limits of whatever you can do in the world and and to accomplish your dreams suddenly the question comes up again like the meaning of this what what am I doing what is the point so suddenly you realize that everything that was outside was just a projection of within so suddenly you realize that the meaning that everything has in the outside is the meaning that I give to it so if there is no meaning in the outside that means that I am not given a meaning that I do n't have a meaning.

So I go within I go to look for my inner aspect to to find a meaning within myself.

So there comes the time of spirituality philosophy the sick of new points new meanings.

So there is a moment when I ask myself oh now everything how I 'm mining but because I got a meaning but suddenly you may say if I am the one giving the meaning so who I am and when you start to look for the meaning of who you are you start to feel everything like multi-dimensional beings the other lives everything that gives a meaning to what you are now all the masters the different realities everything beyond this what you know and and suddenly you give a meaning to everything because of that suddenly you recognize that all of that that gave meaning to you does n't exist and suddenly all of that was just a projection from yourself from a bigger mind that you call am.

So suddenly you realize that is it I am the creator so you say oh yes now I got the new meaning is I am the creator I am the one creating all that.

## Daily Practice Elements

So suddenly one day I recognize that not even me is real because I was thinking that it 's me the one creating believing and creating everything suddenly I realize no it 's not me there 's no I am me because I am just another projection from a concept that was I am I am as a concept is not a person so suddenly you realize that you are and the projection from them so suddenly you lose the of everything everything is pointless and suddenly you realize that the only thing that is a concept is only one thing that I call unity and suddenly when I find the meaning of what is unity I am trying to touch unity and suddenly I find the void vacuum and everything lose meaning so suddenly there is no other thing but to give a meaning to the word so what is the meaning of void is the capacity to create meaning so what is the point of all this that we have spent our entire lives trying to find the meaning of things but always at the moment when you find the meaning of something there will come another thing that will erase the sense of the previous concept saying that it does n't have any meaning so basically here comes the question so what is the meaning of all this why do we do all this what is the meaning so I am sorry but I guess that this is the answer so maybe this is one of the most difficult things that a mind needs to process in order to understand this so the truth is that there is no sense so basically the reason why there is no sense that everything is no sense in the reality it is because senses are the basis of our existence through the five senses that we have and our five senses are trying to fit the ideas of the world in a specific moment and in a specific time let 's try to make an exercise to understand this basically the brain the mind designs the brain in order to be able to receive the information of the entire world of the outside through electrical pulses so through all the nerves in our body we receive the electrical pulses to get the information so basically what the senses are doing is to design like kind of a map of the environment we are moving in we are moving through so basically what the senses are by smell hearing such touch and taste the five senses what they are doing is to to make an interpretation of the environment so we could create like a like a maze like a maze in our mind like a map where our consciousness could go and find the specific points locations inside a specific time and a specific space so basically we have to picture like an invisible mind that is creating positive and negative pulses of energy that sends data information from the filling and by that starts to create a map where the mind could move through so this is why to all this map of the mind we call the sense or the meaning so the reason why we call the sense is because it was brain it was part it was created by the brain like mapping the reality to know where you are moving through so basically in English meaning to give a meaning to something comes from the world mean that comes from the world means that means specifically mind okay so this is why meaning is only related with the perception of mind what this means that all the meanings that we give to anything in our reality in our life is only based in the perceptions of the mind of the outer world so this is why each human has a different meaning of life basically any meaning that we want to give to the existence will be determined of how we feel existence that if we are willing to find a more accurate meaning to everything what we have to do is to find how to clean and to work precisely to work precisely with our five senses so this is why it 's so important the five senses since the moment we are born we need to learn how to fill them how to interpret them how to use them before anything else we need to learn how to use proper or five senses because they will determine how we feel the world so once we know how to handle properly the five senses of our reality suddenly we 'll to open ourselves to the senses of the fourth dimension the fifth dimension and we start to perceive more and more senses in different realities as more as much more senses get achieved from our multidimensional reality the best we can map the reality the existence but the reality that we can not perceive the truth of the universe just by only our five senses so this is why we can not determine the reality the existence the logic of the whole universe only through our five senses once your mind has mapped the reality and your consciousness has gone through all the different parts of this map you suddenly go into another level of consciousness you rise yourself into another perception no dimensions but just perceptions of yourself and suddenly you say oh now I got the meaning of all this so you start a new one so when you start a new one so other senses had no idea of this new reality so you lose the sense of everything because you have to start again so here 's when we go into into another conflict we have built our senses the map of our reality through the idea of the realities so the idea of the reality is the one that made us believe that in order to reach the divine we need to go into layers of society or not another idea that we have created through the senses is that in order to to reach the all we have to go in a path towards the horizon so we have created this concept this idea of the universe according to in which in which direction which path are you taking in life the sense of transit okay so this is why we also have designed the universe according to a path that goes ahead or a hierarchy that takes us up also we have said that if our senses have been able to design a sense of meaning of reality through mind so the universe have done exactly the same the universe is a mind designing a purpose so let 's take the image of something that I wrote a few days ago did you remember that the text that I put all the dots and each dot represented a century and the few five last centuries are the ones with much movement and our history of the last 500 years so now take this image if we take the first moment of the first cell in history how many dots we would have to ride until we reach to the century the one before so imagine that all our history is just in the last 30 dots 30 dots of thousands and millions of dots of centuries in the history of reality nothing and the last 500 years this idea of meaning started of meaning to everything started around I do n't know maybe a hundred dots before if each dot is a century so from a list of billions of dots representing the centuries the last hundred dots were the ones in which we have designed the meaning the purpose the sense of the universe so what I want to say with this is that through thousands and billions of years everything worked and nobody asked never about meaning nobody worried about the meaning until now so why is important now why everything worked so well even if nobody have said at any time this is the meaning of life maybe this is complex but I just want to go to the last the very last dot of the list so what I want to say is that the universe is n't something with meaning the universe is something that is creating meanings is the creator of meanings and it 's in that moment when we humans appear in this corner of the galaxy so we are one of those thousands of conscious intelligence fishes that design the meaning of the universe so at any time that you that the question but what what is the meaning of this comes after this is well if there is no meaning I am the one that have to give meaning to it remember we can not put in the same level meaning with reality because the meaning has emerged in order to understand the reality so there was no meaning before reality because meaning the senses were designed as tools to understand to perceive the reality so this is why when we go to the very beginning and origin of all the things the last thing that we will find there is meaning so this is why there 's these people that can touch the origin of everything what they feel is void vacuum is that vacuum that allows them to give the meaning to everything so this is not a spoiler of the universe so I am saying all this not as in this spoiler of the universe but as a tool for you so when you go outside tomorrow to the world and you say what is this your inner self can say I do n't understand this so I will give it a new meaning so I hope you you got this and if you did n't got it if you did n't get it so it does n't matter because because it has any sense so let 's go to the alignment the very important day is new the statement for today is I am destiny of all tests so this is referring to the that we receive in the known sense each time that we feel it the code for today is the physical pattern ha says by acknowledging this temple the body it can be analyzed it can be analyzed the planes and folded and take notice of its construction the study analysis research make it acknowledge itself as the architect of its own reality being able to transform its walls chambers altars according to its needs improving matter acting in the creator conscience from matter ha is the sound of realization of the clarification of bringing heaven to earth start to see it comfortable ha is I let the weight of my body fall down take a deep breath ha is the perceive the air coming in through the nose towards the lungs heart blood organs and muscles you I first see me my body starts to feel bored empty as the air becomes wind the loving inside making me feel light as a feather I perceive the air around me becoming wind turning into one with the wind inside of me I picture myself on the top of mountain at the edge of it observing below a beautiful valley bleibenadel and motto I started to perceive the wind coming from the valley , crossing all my body , feet , legs , hip , hands and arms , belly and chest , shoulder , toe , neck , head , on hair. Take a deep breath and put your hands facing up to the sky. I call the energy of the sun to come through my body , and body that is now in its axis , still , firm here and now. I perceive the light coming through my crown , their eye , throat , heart , plexus , salmon , root , knees and ankles , spreading through my feet.

Take a deep breath and feel two rays of light coming from the feet , from each one of them , to the palms of your hand. Feel the light filling the palms as they start to feel heavy as if the light becomes physical. And I hold the meaning , the sense of everything in my life , and in the other one , I hold the nonsense , the meaningless concepts of existence. I become aware that the meaning of my life , the sense of it , is the one that I give to my life.

And in the other hand , the known sense of my life , of existence , is the path to remind myself that it 's me , the only one , capable to give a meaning to it.

So , aside , take my hands to my chest and my heart. With my sound , I start to unify these two concepts as one within me. That every test that I have gone through in my life has given the meaning to my life , and the great test is to go beyond the nonsense to find a new one. Take a deep breath , becoming aware in the center of your body , that I am the only one capable to give a meaning to everything in my life.

For I am the destiny of all the tests. Did you? Take a deep breath. And I begin to spread this awareness through all my body by crossing it , stretching and joining.

And I come back here and now softly opening my eyes.

## Q&A

So , as always , thank you for being there. And see you tomorrow at the same time for the tours. Bye. Rest.
