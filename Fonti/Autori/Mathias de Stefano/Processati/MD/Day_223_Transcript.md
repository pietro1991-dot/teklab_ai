# Day 223 - Surrender: Saving Energy for the Right Moment

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Throat
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Emotional Week
- **Main Topic:** Surrender, Energy Management, and the Wisdom of Letting Go
- **Vibration:** `Pe`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Will that Completes`
- **Code:** Balance - as the universe I am, the order and schematization of everything that I am leads me to find the attribute of balance. This way begins the process of balancing the positive and negative, of placing coherence into priorities and strengthening the axis of my being. This axis, positioned in the center, is what will give generosity to my existing purpose. Nothing is thrown away by balance, for the key is recycling. Everything is useful to the almost axis of the being, the complete level.

## Overview

Today we arrive at the throat chakra of the Emotional Week of Pisces, and our topic is **surrender**.

This topic hurts us a little from the point of view of culture because the archetype of Pisces is to **give everything to the others**, to do as much as possible to accomplish the dreams of others.

This ideal of Pisces—everyone being happy—is sometimes really tough, really difficult, and impossible to accomplish. This is why this archetype usually gets frustrated.

Because Pisces doesn't see how the dreams are very difficult to make real, we need to learn **how to surrender** and what it means to surrender and how we can surrender.

The throat chakra is where we express truth, where we speak our reality. Today's teaching is about finding the truth that **surrender is not defeat**—it is wisdom.

---

## Surrender in Our Culture Today

### The Negative Perception

When we hear the term **surrender** in our culture today, it feels much more like defeat, like something that is wrong, that is not good to do.

We are told:
- You have to overcome all your conflicts
- You have to go to the bottom of things
- You have to earn your life
- You have to fight for what you are looking for

All these concepts make surrender seem like a **failure**.

### Two Cultural Roots

This negative perception comes from two different points, two versions:

1. **Capitalism** (present)
2. **Agriculture** (old)

Both systems taught us that **not fighting = losing = death**.

---

## Understanding Capitalism and Survival

### Capitalism Is Survival

From the point of view of capitalism, many of you might have socialist ideas, communist ideas, feminist ideas. But even though you believe in those, **all of you live through capitalism**.

Why? Because **capitalism is the concept of survival**.

To have success in life means you are able to survive in life. So capitalism is the concept of success—of exiting from one spot to go into a better one.

### Our Capitalist Bodies

The history of capitalism is the history of success, of exiting one spot to go into a better one, of earning matter to allow you to survive more.

Beyond any ideology, **the basics of our biology is to survive**—to take as much as we can from the environment so we can survive.

This makes capitalism the basics of our bodies, which are trying to be successful by surviving.

**Somehow, every one of us has a capitalist body.**

### The Body's Logic

This is a very basic thought: our biology says, "**If I don't eat today, I will die.**"

The body is about earning and absorbing things and storing things because the body says: **"The only way I can earn time is if I earn space."**

Earning space means to **store matter**.

- If I store food for a month, I can live for a month.
- If I store a house and food for a year, I will sleep and eat for a year.

That's the basic thought.

---

## The History of Fighting for Survival

### Thousands of Years of Storage

Through thousands of years of this survival practice, the body has been trying to do as many things as possible, to store as much as possible.

But what happens if someone cannot work enough to get things? Suddenly they don't have food, they don't have a house, they are not fighting to have those things.

The body interprets this: "**Oh, so I'm losing. I can die.**"

And others around say: "If you don't work hard, you won't get the resources, you will lose your house, you will lose everything."

**If you stop doing this, the only way out is death.**

That's the old way of seeing it—thousands of years of seeing reality like that.

### Expansion and Protection

Through thousands of years, humans started to expand in order to acquire things, to get things and not lose things.

At the beginning, it was only a tree with plants—I could have fruits from there, and that's it.

But then we have more trees, then we grow as a family, we have terrain, from that terrain a big territory. There's so many people that we need to **protect all that territory** for ourselves to ensure our future.

So we create an **army** to protect that territory from others who can take it away from us.

### Defending What We Have

Where we start to do is to defend the territories, creating a system of protection.

Because we don't want to lose anything, we start to defend it in order not to lose it.

Because if we lose the matter to another one, if we lose space (the territory), **we are losing time**. And if we lose time, this means we are dead.

### Cultural Conditioning

Through thousands of years of history, we created this cultural idea: **if we lose matter and are defeated, we are losing everything—our life**.

From this concept of losing things is born the idea of **fighting for things**.

- To fight to defend the territory
- To fight to protect the food
- To fight for what we work for

## The Problem with Modern Philosophy

### Easy to Speak from Comfort

Matias says: "It's easy sitting here speaking like this through internet, being very philosophical, saying 'What about love and all being one and why should we fight?'"

"Yes, of course, that's really easy to make philosophy about this, speaking from a beautiful place and being online through internet."

### When the System Fails

But you just cut all the electricity, and suddenly there's no system at all, everything disappears, erased from the system.

What do we have to do? Again, go back to the fields to sow and harvest our own food. And if someone comes and steals that—steals the things we were working for one year—**we will defend**.

We will have to defend what we've done, our hard work. **It's natural.**

### Capitalism Is Born from Survival

This is how capitalism is born in our entire societies: because of **survival** and **success in survival**.

---

## The Cultural Idea of Never Surrendering

### Protecting More Than Food

During all this time of history, we have not only protected our food and territory. We started to protect also:
- Our families
- Our loved ones
- Our ideas
- Our philosophies

We started to fight for our families, for loved ones, to fight for an idea, for philosophy.

By fighting for it, we created this concept: **we should not surrender**. We must fight for what we want.

- We should fight to get the love we want
- We should fight to accomplish our philosophy, our ideals

### Surrender = Death

We started to create this concept of **not to surrender because if you surrender, you die**.

This is how the ancient way of surviving relates with the actual system, which is capitalism.

---

## Humans Haven't Evolved in 300,000 Years

### Same Needs, Different Forms

Matias isn't criticizing any systems. The point he wants to make is this:

In the last **300,000 years** of history, we only changed the forms, but we're still having the **same needs**.

What he wants to show here is that **in at least the last 300,000 years, humans haven't evolved nothing in their way of thinking**.

From the very beginning until now, we have exactly the same needs.

### Why We Keep Repeating

The reason we keep doing exactly the same is because we have been using the system that was really useful for our history, for our survival.

But **it didn't help us evolve much as a being**—which is to fight for something, to fight.

### The Message Is the Same

Throughout 300,000 years, we have been fighting for things, creating the idea that **surrender is to lose, is to die**.

This is why today people tell us exactly the same as our ancestors 300,000 years ago: **"If you want something, you have to fight for it."**

---

## Warriors of Light

### A Question to Consider

Matias now points to this: **How many of you consider yourself a warrior of light, and why?**

There's no need to answer out loud—it's just an answer to give to yourself.

How many of you know people who consider themselves **warriors of light**, fighting to light the world?

### Matias Is Not a Warrior

Matias explains from his point of view: some people say he is a warrior of light, and he says, **"I am not."**

"I am not a warrior. No such thing. I don't really care about what other people are doing. I am not working for light. I am not working for the darkness. I think each one of them are doing their job. **I am doing mine. I don't care.**"

"You will never see me speaking about the work of other people. Each one does its own part. I don't care."

### Where Does "Warrior of Light" Come From?

From where comes this concept of warrior of light?

It comes from the concept: **you have to fight in order to overcome the opposite and to survive**.

Matias is also not a worker of light because **he doesn't like to suffer**. "I don't do hard work. I don't labor in the universe. I am basically a **public employee** of the universe."

## The True Meaning of Surrender

### Surrender Doesn't Mean Defeat

The reason for all this explanation is to understand: we have been using the concept of surrender as something wrong, something to avoid in your life because you have to fight for something.

But **surrender doesn't mean defeat**. It's not related to that. **It doesn't mean to lose.**

Actually, the reason we are not evolving enough is because **we are not surrendering**. We keep fighting in a fight that doesn't exist.

### Etymology of Surrender

Let's analyze the word **surrender**.

In English, we have "surrender." It comes from the same word in Spanish, "rendir" (to surrender).

**Surrender** comes from:
- **"Sur"** = under, below
- **"Re"** = again
- **"Dare"** (Latin) = to give

To give something.

**"Render"** is to master anything, to do something, to make a product of something.

### To Give Something Back

**Surrender** means **to do something under**, to do something below.

The concept of surrender means that **something you give comes back to you**. It means **to give something back**.

And what is that something? **The things that you have done**—the things you have realized, you have accomplished in your life.

**You give them, and then you surrender, taking them back toward you.**

### Taking Back Your Energy

When you surrender, it means you are **taking back all the things that you have given**.

---

## How We Waste Energy

### Fighting Constantly

We are constantly putting our energy out there to things.

But what we normally do is **fight in order to have our results** with that energy.

We are fighting constantly to:
- Get what we worked for
- Get the emotions we are looking for
- Get the ideas, the feedback of the ideas we are looking for

We are fighting so much that **we waste our own energy constantly**.

When we are doing this—basically fighting and losing energy all the time—**we exhaust ourselves**.

---

## What Surrender Really Means

### Taking Energy Back

What does it mean to surrender?

**To surrender means to take that energy back to me and to use it in another moment**—to use it in a moment when you consider it would be better.

**It's not losing. It's earning energy for the right moment.**

It's not stop fighting. **It's to be intelligent in how you use your energy.**

When you surrender, you are just **taking that energy back**.

### The Example of Sleep

It's like, for example, going to sleep.

Imagine if every time you go to sleep, you think: "Oh my god, I'm losing! I'm losing my life! Why should I sleep? I don't want to do this because I'm wasting time!"

Imagine you take every time, every night that you go to sleep, as a surrender.

**Your body needs to earn energy for the next day.**

To surrender is not to lose. **It's to save.** Save energy. It's to learn how to manage, to **demonstrate the inner energy**.

---

## Martial Arts and Energy Management

### Asian Philosophies

As examples, you have the martial arts—all the Asian from Buddhism: **Tai Chi**, **Chi Kung**, **Kung Fu**, all of that.

They teach to learn how to manage your energy, how to save your energy and use it for the **right thing** in the **right moment**.

The **Tao**, all these teachings from Asia, were about **how to surrender**, how to manage your own energy.

### Asian Philosophy

These Asian philosophies are telling us: **You should not fight.**

Don't lose time on the fight. You should **earn and save this energy for the right moments and the right things**.

So you are not fighting to get things. **Things will come to you as you take care of your own energy.**

---

## Surrender Is Not Wrong

### Saving Energy

Now you understand that surrender is nothing wrong.

Surrender is not losing a war. **Surrender is saving the energy for the right moment.**

From the basic body, from the soul, from the motion, from the spiritual mind, **we can surrender**.

Remember: surrender means **to bring back the power to me**.

### The Power of Surrender

There's a lot of people speaking about the "power of surrender."

Now, from the etymology, we understand what it really means.

**Why surrender has more power than fighting for something?**

---

## The Example of the Ocean

### Lost in the Sea

Matias wrote in the post an example:

Someone is lost in the sea, and that person knows that their house is **5,000 kilometers ahead**.

They're willing to get to the house, but just behind there is an island **50 kilometers behind**, where the currents of the sea are taking this person.

But this person is **fighting so much** that they don't let go.

### The Island Behind

If that person doesn't surrender, the current won't be able to bring them to the shores of the island, where there is an **airport** that can take them home.

And that person, by fighting with all the energy left, **drowns in the ocean**.

### Finding Other Ways

Sometimes we don't surrender because we believe we are not going to be able to survive unless we fight this battle we have ahead.

But sometimes when you surrender and you go behind, **you will find a hundred different ways** to overcome that battle.

---

## Advice for Spiritual People

### Don't Waste Energy Fighting the Old

Matias's advice for all the spiritual people willing to create a new society, a new civilization:

**Don't waste your energy on fighting against the old system, the old world**, because the new one is coming anyway.

It's better if you **keep your energy to live it**.

---

## Next Month: The Battle

### Preparing for Aries

Just a parenthesis from this: next month we will start the battle, which is the month of **Aries**.

We will go into the battle. But in order to restart the will of that battle, of that energy, of the fight, **we need to surrender** so we can do it properly.

So we can really do it when it is the right time.

---

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortable. Close your eyes. Concentrate on your breathing. Take a deep breath.

Feel the energy of your body—the heat and the cold, the places where it moves, all around your body, around it and within it.

### Recognizing Emotions

Become aware that this energy is an ocean—all the emotions that you can feel right now that are moving through your body in this moment.

Watch them. Feel them. Recognize them.

**Recognize that your emotions are your energy**, the magnetism that emerges from the particles that create your electrons, your atoms.

### Bringing to the Core

Bring all this energy to the core. Take a deep breath. Make it explode.

Extend all your body toward the infinite, dissolving all of it, every atom.

Like a star floating in the cosmos.

### Expansion and Barriers

Feel the energy of your soul expanding toward the infinite.

Recognize that all this that exploded, expanded—this is all the things that you give to the universe, all the things that you deliver to existence through your own energy.

As you see the expansion of yourself, you can feel that around you, there are **barriers**—things that are enabling you, that are not allowing you to expand.

### Picturing the Battles

Picture them. They are the **conflicts that hold you**, the things that you are fighting against.

Picture all the battles of your life.

Recognize that the reason why you can't fight them, you can't overcome them, is because **you waste all your energy, your power, on the expansion**.

### Surrender to Gain Energy Back

You have to **gain back all energy** toward you to be able to radiate and go beyond.

Take a breath. With your imagination, start to bring back every atom, every particle, toward you, bringing the energy that comes closer.

The way you do it is by **surrendering** for everything, for the energy and power to come back to you.

### Letting Go

Take a deep breath. Watch straight to the battles around you.

**Surrender.** Let yourself surrender in front of them. Take a breath and stop expanding.

Make the retreat.

Breathe back to the bright heart within. With your will, start to pull back all the things that were apart from you.

**Surrender for everything. Surrender for everything.**

Bring all back to the center. Bring all back to the core.

### Integration

Recognize that putting all your energy together, you restore the will to create again, to manifest coherence, to cooperate with yourself.

Sound the vibration **Pe** from your throat.

**I am the will that completes. I am the will that completes.**

**I believe. I believe. I believe.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Expand from your plexus all this consciousness throughout all the body, all yourself.

Come back here again, each one at your own time.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, identify one battle you are fighting where you are **wasting energy**.

It could be:
- Fighting against someone's opinion of you
- Fighting against a situation you cannot control
- Fighting against your own past

**Practice surrendering**: stop pushing, stop fighting. Pull your energy back. Save it for something that truly matters.

### Energy Audit

Notice where your energy goes throughout the day.

Are you fighting battles that don't need fighting? Are you expanding energy into conflicts that drain you?

**Surrender** means recognizing: "This fight is costing more than it's worth. I will take my power back."

### Sleep as Surrender

Tonight, when you go to sleep, recognize it as an act of surrender.

You are not losing time—you are **saving energy**. You are restoring yourself so you can be powerful tomorrow.

This is the wisdom of surrender.

---

## Week Context

We are in the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where we learn to flow, to let go, to release control.

Pisces teaches us that sometimes the most powerful thing we can do is **stop fighting**. Unconditional love includes loving ourselves enough to **not exhaust ourselves** in pointless battles.

The throat chakra (today's focus) is where we speak our truth. Today's truth: **"I choose to save my energy. I surrender."**

---

## Q&A

### Q: Isn't surrendering giving up on my dreams?

No. Surrendering is **letting go of the fight** so you can approach your dreams with intelligence rather than exhaustion. You don't abandon the goal—you change the strategy from "fight" to "flow."

### Q: How do I know when to fight and when to surrender?

Ask yourself: "**Is this fight giving me energy or draining me?**" If it drains you more than it serves you, surrender. Save your energy for battles that truly matter and that you can actually win.

### Q: What if I surrender and someone takes advantage of me?

Surrendering is not about **letting others control you**. It's about **controlling your own energy**. You can set boundaries, say no, and protect yourself **without wasting energy in constant fighting**. Surrender the fight, not your power.

### Q: How is surrender different from giving up?

Giving up means **abandoning your goal**. Surrendering means **releasing the method** (fighting) while keeping the goal. You stop the exhausting battle and find a smarter way forward—like the person in the ocean surrendering to the current to reach the island with the airport.

### Q: Why do Asian philosophies emphasize surrender when they also teach martial arts?

Because true martial arts are about **energy management**, not fighting. A master doesn't waste energy fighting—they move with flow, use the opponent's energy against them, and strike only at the right moment. This **is** surrender: saving energy, waiting for the right time.

### Q: If we all surrender, won't injustice continue?

**Surrender the fight, not the action.** You can work for justice without exhausting yourself in constant battle. The new world comes not from fighting the old but from **embodying the new**. Save your energy to create, not to destroy.

### Q: How does this relate to Pisces?

Pisces tries to make everyone happy and often exhausts itself in the process. Surrender teaches Pisces: **you cannot save everyone by fighting their battles**. Sometimes the most loving thing is to let go, save your energy, and trust the process.
