## Introduction

Hello everyone. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you. How are you?

So let 's remember that today we are in the throw chara of the emotional week of pieces , the month of pieces. And today our topic is surrender.

So I hope that you have been able to read the post for today with information about what it means surrender. Because this topic is something that hurts us a little bit from the point of view of culture.

So I would like to explain why we are going to speak about surrender during the pieces month. Because the archetype of pieces is to give everything to the others to do as possible to accomplish the dreams of others.

So this ideal , this ideal , we of pieces have been everyone being happy.

Sometimes it 's really tough , really difficult and impossible to accomplish.

So this is why this archetype usually get frustrated. And because it does n't see how the dreams are very difficult to make real.

So this is why we need to learn how to surrender. And what it means to surrender and how we can surrender.

So let 's try to understand what this topic means to surrender from the point of view of our cultures today. And then we will go back in time. When we hear the term surrender in our cult today , it feels much more like had defeat , like something that is wrong. That is not good to do.

And that we have to overcome all our conflicts that we have to go till the bottom of the things that we have to earn our lives. That we have to fight for what we are looking for , we are willing to , you know , lies. And all this concepts makes surrender and a fail. But this comes from two different points from two versions in the present.

So from two versions , one in the present is related to the capitalism. And the other one which is the old one is related with agriculture.

So from the point of view of capitalism , for sure many of you here have ideas , socialist ideas , communist ideas , feminism ideas. But even though if you believe in that , for sure all of you leave through capitalism. And this is because capitalism is the idea of the capital and is something really old that was designed according to the success. To have success in life means that you are able to survive in life.

So capitalism is the concept of survival , the concept of having success in the things that you , so you can exit from one spot to another from being poor to be rich or whatever. Talking about this idea of the capitalism , we all are a bit capitalist because the idea of the capitalism comes from the survival. And when you need to survive , you need to storage things. You need to have things in order to keep you alive.

So in such a way , somehow , the history of capitalism is the history of success of exiting one spot to go into a better one.

So in to earning matter to allow you to survive more.

So beyond the topic idea of living all as one and harmony , the basics of our biology is to survive , which is to take as much as we can from the environment so we can survive. And this makes that capitalism is the basics of our bodies which are trying to be successful by surviving.

So somehow , somehow , every one of us , we have a capitalist body.

So because of this idea of a capitalist body , we have to understand that this is a very basic thought. We can start to think much more deep about this and of course , many ways to explain this , but let 's go to the very basic thing of our biology or biology says , if I do n't eat today , I will die.

So the body is about earning and absorbing things and storageing things because the body says , the only way in which I can earn time is if I earn space.

So , earning space means to storage matter.

So the body says , if I storage food for a month , the body says , I can live for a month.

So if I storage a house and food for a year , I will sleep and eat for a year , that 's a basic thought. I 'm not saying here that this is like this , I 'm just saying that this is the thought of a body.

So the body needs to keep doing things , starting to get things , so it can live longer.

So , through thousands of years of this survival practice , what the body has been doing is to try to do as many things as possible to storage as much things as possible. But what I hear that if someone can not work enough in order to get the things , suddenly they do n't have more food , they do n't have house , they are not fighting to have those things.

So the body interprets this , like , oh , so I 'm losing , I can die. And the other ones around are saying , if you do n't work hard , you wo n't get the resources to find the food , you will lose your house , you will lose everything.

So if you stop doing this , the only way out is that 's the old way of seeing it , 2000s of years , we started to fail to see this reality like that.

So in this way , through thousands of years , humans started to expand in order to acquire things , to get things and not lose things.

So the thought is at the beginning was only a tree with plants and I could have fruits from there and that 's it. But then we have more trees and then we grow as a family and we have a terrain and from that terrain , a big territory.

So there 's so many people that we need to protect all that territory for ourselves to ensure our future.

So we create an army to protect that territory from others that can take it away from us.

So where we start to do is to defend the territories , creating a system of protection. And where we start to do is to create an army , defend the territory.

So because we do n't want to lose anything , we start to defend that in order to not lose it. Because if we lose the matter in hands of other one , if we lose space , the territory , we are losing also time.

So if we lose the time , this means that we are dead.

So through all thousands of years of history , where we have done is to create this idea , this cultural idea , that if we lose the matter and we are being defeated , we are losing everything our life.

So this concept of losing things is born the idea of fighting for things.

So to fight in order to defend the territory , we need to fight in order to defend to protect the food. We need to make a hard work in order to have the food in order to have the houses. We need to protect , we need to defend to fight for what we work for.

So as I was right now , it 's easy sitting here and speaking like this , three internet and being very , I would say , I 'm not a philosophical in this speaking , what about the love and all being won and why we should fight for this and so on. Yes , of course , that 's really easy to make philosophy about this speaking from beautiful place and being all three internet. You just cut all the electricity and suddenly we know system at all and everything just disappear the race from the system a race.

So what we have to do is again to go back to the fields to see and harvest our own food and if someone comes and still 's dead. And it 's still the things that we were working for one year , we will defend. We will have to defend what we 've done , our hard work is natural , okay , so that 's basically like this. This is how capitalism and India is born in our entire societies because survival.

And success in the survival.

So for example , when we. When we we can say yes , but there were communities like communism that worked. Why? Because the communities where also exchanging capitals , beings , things , sorry , the goods.

And they were sharing all the things. It 's good , but they were sharing matter physical things , so that 's the capitals. The only different difference here is that you have not. Opportunities to success of compete.

But not because it 's natural not to compete , but because whoever one compete was killed or it 's poor , except so basically not much freedom there. What I 'm saying here is that the capitalism is the best system because it 's the only one that works. I 'm describing here how the humanity used the capitalism throughout the story and how it was mold , it mold our way of understanding and living. Not because it 's the best system and the only one that works , but because the capitalism is aligned with our point of view of our consciousness.

In our level of consciousness , we are thinking about stuff and things. And this is why the capitalism is the best system for all of us because of our level of consciousness. For sure , another system will come up. It 's easy like this.

So it was the capitalist idea that since the very beginning thousands of years ago , shaped the mind of humans to fight for that what we are willing for.

So during all this time of history , what we have done was not only to protect our food and territory. We started to protect also our families to protect the loved ones to protect an idea.

So we started to fight for our families for the loved ones to fight for an idea for philosophy. And by fighting for it , we created this concept that we should not surrender. That we must fight for what we want. That we should fight to get the love we want.

We should fight and do everything that we want. And then we can , in order to accomplish our philosophy , our ideals.

So we started to create this concept of not to surrender because if you surrender you die. Is this how the engine way of surviving relates with the actual system which is the captain? And with this , what do I want to say? I 'm not criticizing any systems.

The only thing I 'm using here is that in the last 300,000 years of history , we only change the forms , but still having the same needs. We revolution.

So I 'm in the form of it.

So what I want to point to lies here is not to criticize the system. Because the system is , but what I just want to show here is that in at least the last 300,000 years , humans had n't evolved nothing in their way of thinking. That 's from the very beginning until now we have exactly the same needs.

So the reason why we keep doing exactly the same is because we have been using the system. That was really useful for our history , for our survival. But it did n't help us to evolve much as a beam , which is to fight him for something , fight for.

So throughout this 300,000 years , we have been fighting for things , creating the idea that surrender is to lose , is to die. And this is why today people tell to us exactly the same as our ancestors , 300,000 years ago , which is if you want something you have to fight for it.

So now I will point into this , how many of you here consider yourself a warrior of light and why. There 's no need for you to answer , of course , it 's just an answer to give to yourself. If you are , or how many of you know people that consider themselves warriors of light , that are fighting in order to light the world.

So I will explain from my point of view , some people say that I am a warrior of light and I am not. I am not a warrior of not such a thing. I do n't really care about what the other people is doing. I am not working for light , I am not working for the darkness.

I think that each one of them are doing their job. I am doing mine. I do n't care. You will never see me speaking about the work of other people.

It 's one does its own part.

So I do n't care. From where comes this concept of a light. It comes from the concept of you have to fight in order to overcome the opposite and to survive. Basically , I am also , I am not a worker of light because I do n't like to suffer.

So I do n't do a hard work. I do n't labor in the universe. I am basically a public employee of the universe.

The reason all this explanation to understand , and we have been using the concept of surrender as something that is something that is wrong , that something you have to avoid in your life because you have to fight for something. What really is happening is that surrender does n't mean defeat is not related with that. It does n't mean to lose. And actually , the reason why we are not evolving enough is because we are not surrender.

We keep fighting in a fight that exists.

So let 's analyze the word surrender. I am going to take notes of the concept so I do n't forget none of them. English we have here surrender. It comes from the same word in Spanish surrender.

Surrender comes from soup which is under the low. The means again , and the depth of the means to give. To give something.

So re , re , gives the surrender that surrender means to do something. Rendered is to master anything , do something to make a product of something to surrender.

So surrender is to do something under to do something below.

So surrender , the third concept of surrender means to that something that you give comes back to you. It means to give something back. That 's surrender. To give something back.

And what is that something? The thing that you have done. The things that you have realized that you have accomplished in your life. You give them and then you surrender taking them back towards you.

So when you surrender means that you are taking back all the things that you have given.

Okay.

So understand now to wrap this idea. What is surrender? The thing is that we are constantly putting our energy gear away to the things. But what we normally do is to fight in order to have our assault with that energy.

So we are fighting constantly to get what we act , to get the emotions that we are looking for , to get the ideas , the feedback of the ideas that we are looking for. And we are fighting so much that we waste our own energy constantly.

So when we are doing this basically fighting and losing energy all the time.

So what it means to surrender. To surrender means to take that energy back to me. And to use it in another moment. To use it in a moment when you consider it would be better.

It 's not losing. It 's earning energy for the right moment. It 's not stop fighting. It 's to be intelligent in how you use your energy.

So when you surrender. You are just taking that energy back. It 's like for example going to sleep. Imagine if you think when you go to sleep.

You say , oh my god , I 'm losing. I 'm losing my life. Why should I sleep? I do n't want to do this because I 'm wasting time.

And fight for my life. Imagine that you take every time , every night that you go to sleep as a surrender. Your body needs to earn energy for the next day.

So to surrender is not to lose. It 's to save. Save energy. It 's to learn how to manage to demonstrate the inner energy.

So as examples , you have the martial arts. All the Asian from the Buddhism , Tai Chi , Chi Kung Kung Fu. All that. To learn how to manage your energy.

How to save your energy and use it for the right thing in the room.

So the Tao , all these teachings from Asia were about how to surrender. How to manage your own energy. This would be this Asian philosophies. Are telling us you should not fight.

Do n't lose time on the fight. You should earn and save this energy for the right moments and the right things.

So you are not fighting to get things. Things will come to you as you take care of your own energy.

So have you understand now that surrender is nothing wrong. That surrender is not losing a war. Surrender is saving the energy for the right moment. From the basic body , from the soul , in the motion , from the spiritual mind , we can surrender.

And remember , surrender means to bring back the power to me.

So now for example , there 's a lot of people speaking about the power of surrender. And now from the etymology , we 'll understand what it really means. Why surrender more power than fighting for something. And I , today , I wrote in the post , I wrote about this example that someone that lost himself in the sea and that person knows that his house is 5 , 5000 kilometers ahead.

And he 's willing to get to his house , but just behind has an island 50 kilometers behind where the currents of the sea are taking this person. But this person is fighting so much that person does n't let go if that person does n't surrender. The current wo n't be able to bring that person to the shores of the island where there is an airport that can take you home. And that person by fighting with all the energy left that he had and drowns in the ocean.

Sometimes we do n't surrender because we believe we are not going to be able to survive unless we fight this battle that we have had. But sometimes when you surrender and you go behind , you will find a hundred different ways to overcome that battle.

So my advice for all the spiritual people willing to create an user 's society and new civilization. Do n't waste your energy on fighting against the old system , the old world , because the new one is coming anyway.

So it 's better if you keep your energy to live it.

So just parenthesis from this. Next month we will start the battle , which is the month of areas. We will go into the battle. But in order to restart the will of that battle , of that energy , of the fight , we need to surrender so we can do it properly.

So we can really do it when it is the right time.

Okay , let 's go for the information for today. The vibration for today is pain. The code for today is balanced. And the certain reports as the universe I am , the order and the schematization of everything that I am , leads me to found the attributes of balance.

This way begins the process of balancing the positive and negative of placing coherence into priorities and strengthen the axis of my being. This axis position in the center is what will give me the generosity to my existing purpose. Nothing is thrown away by balance. For the key is recycling.

Everything is useful. The almost axis of the being. The complete level. Close your eyes.

Concentration your breathing. Take a deep breath. And I feel the energy of my body , the heat and the cold. The place is where it moves.

Two hours of my body around it and within it. I become aware that this energy is ocean. All the emotions that I can feel rain that are moving through my body in this moment. I watch them , fill them , recognize them.

I recognize that my emotions are my energy. The moment is the magnetism that emerges from the particles that creates my electrons , my atoms.

So I bring all this energy to the core and the side take a deep breath. I make it explode. Extending all my body towards the infinite. The solving all of it.

Every atom. Like it starts floating in the cosmos. I can feel the energy of my soul expanding towards the infinite. I recognize that all this that exploded expanded.

This all the things that I give to the universe. All the things that I deliver to the existence through my whole energy. As I see the expansion of myself , I can feel the feeling that around me there are barriers. There are things that enable me to expand.

So I picture them. They are the conflicts that holds me. The things that I am fighting against. I picture all of this battles of your life.

And I recognize that the reason why I ca n't fight them , I ca n't overcome them. It 's because I was all my energy , my power , on the expansion.

So I have to gain back all energy towards me to be able to radiate and go beyond.

So I take the breath and with my imagination , I start to bring back every atom , particle , towards me , bringing to energy that comes closer and the way I do it is by surrender for everything , for the energy and power to come back to a side to it , taking deep breath. I watch straight to the battles of my indies , surrender , I let myself surrender with the front of them. I take the breath and I stop expanding , making the retreat.

So I 'm in back to the bright , how we 've been , and with my singing , I start to pull back all the things that were apart from me. The soul around. I 'm in back to the battles of my indies , surrender for everything , surrender for everything , surrender for everything , surrender for everything. I 'm in back to the battles of my indies , surrender for everything , surrender for everything , surrender for everything.

I 'm in back to the battles of my indies , surrender for everything , surrender for everything. I 'm in back to the battles of my indies , surrender for everything , surrender for everything. I 'm in back to the battles of my indies , surrender for everything , surrender for everything. I recognize that putting all my energy together , I restore the will to create again to manifest your coherence , to cooperate with you.

I am the will that completes. I 'm in back to the battles of my indies , surrender for everything , surrender for everything. I believe. I believe.

I believe. I believe. I believe. I believe.

Thank you everybody for being here with me and see you tomorrow at the same time.
