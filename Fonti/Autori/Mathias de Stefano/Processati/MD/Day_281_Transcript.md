## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. Welcome to all of you to another week more in this path , the beginning of our week , of our emotional week of Turns.

So let 's begin with the topic for today , which is related to home.

So let 's talk about home. First of all , try to understand what home means. Home of course , that is a very subtle concept that defines not the place where we leave , but the state in which we live in that place.

So it 's more related to the concept of how do we feel , the connections that we have there , the memories , the emotions that we feel.

So the main difference between home and house would be that house is the structure where you leave. The architectural structure of a place of living. While home is describing all the soul that is within that house.

So it 's much more related to the soul , the essence , the emotions that you can feel within inside a house.

So of course that we might leave in house , but we do n't feel at home in that house. Maybe that house has different things that I do n't like , and we 'll consider home the place where I feel quiet and fine and happy.

So let 's try to understand why we call home to this concept and feeling of a place instead of the site and structure where I leave.

So let 's go into the concept of home. Home is kind of related with the etymology of a rat in Spanish. I 'll edit it because it is also referring to a place where you feel comfortable. It 's related to the idea of a hot place.

The word home means place or warm place. Warm place. The idea of a word of an inderapient word that was idol remember the word. But anyway the word means a place where you stay.

Where you are comfortable. That is warm. The connection with the topology of a rat in Spanish is that it is related with a word called Fonda. That comes from the word Focus.

In English we have the word Focus. That is to concentrate in something to see something really strange.

So when we say Focusing on something it comes from the exactly word in Latin that means fire.

So Focus means fire which means that is the place where you have the light. Is the place where you have the the the straight light. The thing is that we were related with this even for English fire comes from another place. Another etymology which is the great one in peace.

We have this concept of Latin which is Focus. The idea of home is related to a warm place because we are talking about a place that have fire inside. Like a lighthouse.

Sorry lighthouse. Like a fireplace inside a house. In in English you do n't have exactly the same words that we have in Latin languages. But we in Latin has the fire place on the house is basically called exactly the same as Fogadas home in Spanish.

It 's much more straight related in the Latin languages that then in the English language.

So let 's understand why in history we have called home as the place where we have fire.

So first of all to understand this we have to go to the first moment where when humans discover fire. And by discover fire I do n't mean that before we did n't have fire. I mean that we were able to handle the fire that we used it as tools. When we have been doing during the first time of humanity was to high to go to high to go high on the trees to go on caves and try to keep ourselves protected from the predators from the predators that were much bigger than we are.

Today many of the predators that we had in the past they do n't exist anymore. They get extinct the last glaciation 10,000 years By.

So they are not here anymore but in that time we had big predators that used to eat us.

So we had no way to defend ourselves from them. And when we got to manage the fire from some lightning that was closed by we managed to get a torch and to create a fireplace.

So we started to sleep around the fireplace. We were trying to keep the fire alive as much as longer as we could.

So we can protect ourselves during the night. This allowed us to see because of the bridges of the fire we could see if there were some animals coming and also we were able to use the fire to protect ourselves as tool for fight against this animals because they were afraid of the fire. One of the other things that gave us the fire in that moment. The fire was the first to be able to fight the security to feel safe against the predators.

It was also to feel quiet because we have heat.

So we also slept having heat.

So we were not freezing any more during the night. We were not managing the fire with something really important. And because we had no idea yet how to make the fire itself by ourselves. We needed to keep the fire to keep it alive.

And this is why some women were the keepers of the fire. The women were the keepers of the fire.

So during the whole day the fire was still alive.

So what they did was to protect it because the men used to go to hunt or to look for food. Far away.

So they were keeping the babies and the cave protecting the the cave.

So they were keeping the fire so they could stay fine during the night.

So what happened once was that this fire keepers this women managed to put water on the fire to start to heat the water.

So they started to boil the water. And what brought us this was really important , which was the day kill all bacteria.

So we were safe because what usually kill us of this bacteria that was in the water now was killed by the boiling water.

So we were able to survive. But not only that they put food in the boiling water.

So they started to cook for the first time. When this when this women the fire keepers they started to cook.

Something really important changed because it was not only that the taste of the food of the meat of the of the. Vegetables changed and was better. But what really happened was that biologically inside a chemical process happened in the food that allowed some nutrients that usually stays stuck in the raw vegetables and and and. And meat all this nutrients started to.

Be to react so they were able to be absorbed.

So when we ate them we would n't lose those nutrients and they started to tourism our brain. And we started to be much more clever because our brain was having all the things that it need.

So we started to evolve in intelligence.

So what this women did was to change the entire history of humanity by cooking.

## Q&A

So as you see today we have a very different concept about women cooking because we have been through many. Centuries of masculine energy in the society that divided the tasks and of course it 's all this much of thing that that said that the women has to cook and whatever. But in reality in history. The concept of women cooking was not only just.

Feed the kids it was transformed humanity. The alchemy of fire , water and food was the thing that changed us all.

So it is not just about cooking is about changing everything is about changing humanity.

So that 's the importance of relation between the women and the kitchen and the cooking is today. It 's not necessary anymore. We relate women with that we can relate us all. In the past it was very different because we were just few people.

And men were stronger that had to go and fight with animals in order to get food. And they could n't put women into risk of death because women were the only clue or the only key to have babies. To keep the species going.

So that 's why they said you keep in the kitchen while the man goes out. It was just a matter of survival.

Today is a culture that is not worth anymore.

So when humanity started to expand and grow and increase civilizations , these firekeepers , they were still there. They exist. It 's equal to a lower E.

So in the European language. There is one word to describe place and fire , which is the word , Wes.

So the women that were in charge of the place of fire were called Wests. That in Greek , we transformed into Vesti. And in Latin was a beetle. In Greek , West , the word the letter was spelled like her.

Wests , that 's why we have Vesti. And for Romans , the Wests , that 's why we have beetle. Another way to say the place of fire in Egyptian language was Hat Ul.

So Hat means place or home house. And Ul means light , the fire , the inner fire.

So Hat Ul is the origin of the name Hat Ul , Author , which is the name of the Goddess of Love of Home.

So we have Hat Author , Vesti and Wests. Three different names that actually are three different ways to call the same thing , which is the house of the light , the house of fire.

So let 's begin by Author. Author is written like this in geroglifics.

So it 's Hat , the house and Ul inside. Ul is the name of Hulu. Hulu is the god of the skies , the god of the sun. The ones that see everything.

Hulu is represented by the Home. The Home was the symbol of Hulu because it was the bird that was able to fly closer to the sun.

So let 's imagine this. In the ancient times , people discovered the fire.

So they started to build houses around the fire. They make a fireplace and the round , they create this house.

So they protect it fire inside.

So they can sleep around the fire , they can cook in the fire , they can share around the fire. And they built a house with a fire inside. When humans started to expand as a civilization , people not only had the fire inside their own houses , but they also had a temple now with the fire for the entire culture , the entire T capital or country.

So they have the fire inside to keep this whole alive.

So the keepers of the fire were in this temple protecting the spirit of the people. Things. Things. Oregon.

Noir. Yes. On say , doi. When we started to believe in gods in the sky , we also believe that those gods must have a house in this sky.

So we started to see that the constellations , the 12 constellations , where the 12 constellations were the people of the family , that were also around a fire. They were living in a fire. And that fire is the sun. And do n't say to all the El Sir al Réadr is La Casa.

So the entire sky around is the house. This is how we get the image that the sky is the house of the gods. We have 12 gods here. And the fire in the center of the sun.

Exactly the same as humans that they have the fireplace , the family , and the roundhouse. The walls of this house is what we call the milky way. Why we call it like this? We have said it because the engine one said that the universe was created by a cow , a huge cow , that was so abundant that was able to create the entire universe.

So that 's why we call it milky way is the path of milky.

So this is why in the Egyptian tradition , they write the name of Father as a house that holds the light inside. But her face is a human with the face of a cow , with horns and ears of a cow. If you do n't know it , look it in the internet and you will see. This is how we have the cow as a place , the home of the light.

Of course , who were the keepers of the light of the fire , women , women were the keepers. And while they do that , they were feeding their babies with milk.

So the image of women given the milk to the babies around the fire was the one that gave the idea of Father as the mother of all creation , given love and beauty.

Okay. In other cultures , the women that wear the protectors of the fire , they had to be , they had to be virgins because they wear the mother , consider the mothers of the entire society. They should n't be mothers by themselves. They should be mother of the whole civilization.

So that 's why they had to be around 30 years being a virgin , which was the time that they had to be in charge of this fire.

So this is how it 's created the idea of home. Home as the place where you have the fire inside , where you feel safe , where you feel warm , where you have the love of a mother , giving you food , being able to sleep , feel protected , feeling happy. That would create the image of home inside a house.

So this fire did also something really important. Give us the intelligence the ability to share the ability to download the ideas into matter. Give us the opportunity to become intelligent.

So fire was the key to create music , to create cultures , basically to create art.

So fire is the one that helps us to be creative , because it 's the one that helps us to focus our intention. Fire to feel hypnotized by the spirit of the fire.

So that 's why we call it the Divine Spark. That 's why we start to call it the light of consciousness. We follow the light , the Voting Flame , the Trim Flame. The fire of the Spirit , the fire of the soul.

All concepts related with this whole history. When we look into the fire , we kind of get hypnotized by it , because it awakens the potential that we have within in our inner fire. Through thousands of years we have the sign this idea that the fire of a home is the place where we can share what we are able to manifest to create , to share with others , family and friends. But when we start to become aware of the spiritual path , the inner path , we start to find the inner fire to activate our inner fire.

That takes us to understand that we are home that home is within. And it does n't matter where I go , home will be with me.

So when we look into the outside , we can see that fire helps us by boiling all the things that can make us batch in the water , all the bacteria that can kill us. When we go into another aspect , we can find that fire cooks , creates our kidney , allowing us to be intelligent by eating , where we cooked , and also the fire can melt metals to create tools so we can work with it. And when we look inside , it happens exactly the same. The inner fire is the one that helps us to purchase our bodies from all the things that we do n't need.

The inner fire is the one that creates our kidney , allowing us to be aware and conscious. And the inner fire is the one able to connect all the things inside , create the tools that we have and awaken the potentials that we have within.

So basically the idea of using this fire within is to find home within ourselves in order to awaken the potential. And these potentials are related with the powers of each one of my charts , which are created by the power of the mother.

So remember that tourists , the mother cow , has within the potential of the being which is playlists. In the heart of the cow.

So for us , the potential that we have within is kind of manifested through the creation of the mother that the engine related with the constellation of tourists , the cow , in the heart of the mother.

So playlists takes us to mythology , Greek mythology. But we are not going to talk about them now.

We are going to talk about the concepts that are behind them , which are the potentials that are created within around that fire. And these potentials from inside our soul , from this fire are the ones that we call the arts , the muses.

So if we take the idea that follows the one that enable us to that helps us to , that helps us to awaken potentials of our arts from within. What we are going to do is to build up this home again for ourselves through the arts to awaken the fire of our soul.

So what we are going to do in the next days will be to go through these arts that helps us to ignite the fire that will make us build our home again , our inner home. From the heart of ha , the mother cow.

So this next day we will be related with our task for the day August 22nd , which is our task for all together , in which we will be for five hours holding a fire. And we will need to hold a fire for five hours while we do the task altogether.

So I will explain this. And I know more about it , but just for you to know that we will do that. Fire , just fire , anyway you can hold fire.

So I recommend to the people that is following from now. And how no idea when speaking about cows and fire and at the task of August 22nd , I would recommend you to go to the other videos that I explained this much more in detail. The one that I spoke about torus , torus constellation and explain about that. And also the videos where I explained about August 22nd , okay , that I do n't remember exactly which one is it.

But I would if you ask someone can tell you for sure. The day that we spoke about panic , also you have information about what we have to do in August 22nd , related to the 12 systems.

So just looking to that because that day we will work with 12 systems and the fire.

So each one would know to do the fire , okay. Whatever you can , a candle , a fireplace , improvised , okay , then ask me how to make a fire. Improvised , I said fire. Do n't just do n't set them fire in your house , just as a advice recommendation.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for the day. The integration for today is raw. The statement for today is I am guardian of the universe. The core for today is comes.

Just like pro-usos are the unicillular world of animals. Comes are the unicillular eukaryotic organisms of the vegetable world. Or better set , okay. There are present on the great part of the world , mainly in the marine worlds , and perform the most part of the planet 's photosynthesis , even though they developed characteristics of the proto-soa and fungi.

How you guys are essential for the life of our planet? Basically , there are ones that feeds the most oxygen in our planet. Let 's go to the alignment for today. Close your eyes , sit comfortable and concentrate in your breathing.

I become aware of the space that surrounds me. The body that I inhabit , and my own breathing. The body that I inhabit , and my own breathing. The body that I inhabit , and my own breathing.

I take your deep breath , and I see with my own imagination , how all the things around me starts to vanish. Every object , everything , it vanishes , until there 's nothing. Only I avoid around me. I pay attention to each object that disappear.

Until I see the walls disappearing , and beyond , there 's nothing. I stare , looking at one only point. I put all the photos. In that spot , all my intention goes through my eyes to this place.

I see the side-sees straight towards this point. I can see how I ignite a spark with all my focus on the spark. It ignites into fire. And I can see the fire grow until it reaches the size of a fireplace.

And I start to feel the heat. Touching my skin , reaching my body , where I can feel comfortable , warm in front of it. I recognize that this fire is the essence of the fire. It 's the essence of my soul.

It 's the element of our community that ignites my potential. To make me be who I am. I take a deep breath , and with my hands , I take this fire and heat. And slowly I start to move and stretch , like dancing , creating the home around the fire.

## Guided Meditation

With the feeling of coming back home , I design the place where I feel at home. The one of my dreams. I breathe and start to create this place through the fire , this home. With my hands in the fire , I start to design the walls , the ground , the roof , windows and boards , the furniture , and every room with a garden.

I use my imagination to manifest my home. Feel the last detail. I come back to see the fire. I come back to see the fire and recognize myself at home.

I can see the distance in my home. Every room is a chara. Every furniture is a story memory. The walls are my skin.

The garden are my projects. The roof , my ideas , the kitchen , my heart. This is the home where I 'm going to leave this week where my soul will express. I contemplate the fire as I take a deep breath , recognize that this home is protecting me.

Taking care of me in the same way as I will protect it. For it is my home. I come back to see the fire. I come back to see the fire.

I come back to see the fire. I am the garden of the universe. I have my home in me. I have my home.

I take this fire with my hands , taking a deep breath and bring it to my heart. I come back to see the fire. I am the garden of the universe. Thank you everybody for being here.
