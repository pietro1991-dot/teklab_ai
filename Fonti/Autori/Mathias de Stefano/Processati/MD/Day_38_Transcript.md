## Overview

On Day 38, we arrive at the **knees**—those hinge-joints that determine whether we advance or retreat, step forward into the future or step backward into the past. Matias offers one of the most body-centered teachings of the entire series: **your knees hold the memory of every step you've ever taken, and every step your ancestors took.**

The knees are where history lives in the body. When you have pain in your knees, it's not just physical wear and tear—it's the weight of all the steps you've been carrying, all the movements you've made without consciousness, all the advances and retreats encoded into the tissue.

The core revelation: **advancing isn't just moving forward. It's moving consciously.** You can walk forward while energetically moving backward. You can physically retreat while spiritually advancing. The direction of your feet doesn't determine the direction of your consciousness.

This day introduces the concept of **resonance versus dissonance in movement**. When you step forward in resonance with your purpose, the movement is light, easy, purposeful. When you step forward in dissonance—forcing yourself to go somewhere your energy doesn't want to go—your knees bear the burden. They register the conflict between what you're doing and what you're meant to be doing.

The task is profound: recognize when you're advancing and when you're retreating. Not as judgment, but as information. Your body knows. Your knees know. They've been keeping score this whole time.

Matias explains that the Knees chakra is one of the "extra" chakras outside the traditional seven—it's part of the 12-chakra system he's been teaching. This chakra governs **how we carry history forward and how we release it behind us.** It's the energetic mechanism of progress.

## Core Teaching

### The Knees: Stepping Into and Out Of Time

Good morning, good evening, good night, everyone. Today we continue with the root chakra. We are working with the mental in the root.

Today we are working specifically with the **knees**—knees, the chakra in the knees. Remember, we are working with the chakra system that has 12 main chakras in the body. The two first ones are the feet, the other one is the knees, the root in the genitals (that would be four). We will continue with the sacrum, the plexus, the heart, the throat, the third eye, the crown. That's 10. The next one would be the aura—the one around the body. The twelfth one would be below the feet, the center of the Earth.

We are working with the chakra system of 12. All of them are related to each other. Today, remember, we've worked with the root in the mental, the mind week, where we can see the attributes, our strengths and our weaknesses.

### History Lives in the Knees

Today we are trying to continue to think about **the concept of the advance**—the advance, like advancing.

One of the concepts we can see within the week is the concept of going through, like advancing, to advance yourself. The knees are the expression we do in order to realize how history affects myself.

The root, yesterday, was more about recognizing my strengths and my weaknesses now. Today I have to start to check **how is history affecting the way I am right now?**

**The knees are the main aspect of my life where I take the energy of the past in order to make me move forward or move backward.** This is the best expression we can get from it.

### Your Knees Know Every Step You've Taken

Usually when we work in the mental body, it's more about realizing: **How do I use my mind in order to analyze my body?**

When I have to do a process to understand what's happening in my knees, the first thing I have to understand is: **The knees accumulates all the energy, all the memory of every step I ever took.**

This is important because of the reason **we have conflicts in the knees usually is basically we didn't take the time to release the past.** All the memory, all the energy that I used to take the steps I gave, are stuck in my body. I don't release it.

### Pain as Information: What Your Knees Are Telling You

**Each time you have pain in your knees, what happens is you are carrying too much weight—the weight of all your history.**

**This is not speaking only about your history—your personal history in this life.** It's also speaking about your family history, your ancestors history, all the patterns, all the genetic codes, all the everything that was related to your mother and your father, your grandmother, your grandfather—they are also within your knees.

Your knees are trying to hold all the memory, all the information of what you have been able to achieve in your path, but also what they achieved in their path.

### The Conflict: Carrying What's Not Yours

One of the main conflict we have here when we try to make our steps towards something, towards our destination, is that **we are taking so much weight of someone else's information that make us feel we cannot walk.**

Let me put a very—I don't want to make it very—yeah, it's a very light thing to say, but let's say a very radical thing, but it's good so you can get the picture.

Imagine your ancestors, for many, many generations, were trying to work for something that make them very tired, very painful, very full of sufferance. For many generations, what they were doing was working, working, working, working, trying to find something, trying to get to a place.

Suddenly you arrived—you. Now, you as the last one, you should be carrying, still, within all your information, of all their experience. If you do not take the time to release their history, their experience, the moment you will try to do a step forward, you will have so much pain in your knees because you are still carrying their weight.

### Stepping Forward with Ancestral Burdens

**You are still carrying what they were trying to do, but it's not yours.** You are carrying someone else's mission in your life because you didn't take the time to release it.

This is what the knees are showing you—especially the pain in the knees. Each time you feel pain in the knees, what you have to do is not to take a painkiller or to take—try to kind of, I don't know, make some stretching or—you can do it. It's good for the body, but you should not just end there.

You should also sit down and ask to your knees: **"What are you—what history are you carrying that's not mine?"**

This is the key concept of how to start to analyze the knees.

### Resonance and Dissonance in Movement

The other aspect I want to check with the knees is the concept that **each time I'm doing a step forward, I'm vibrating in resonance or dissonance with my purpose, with my path.**

Let's picture: Imagine you have to go somewhere, to a place. You want to go there. It's your destiny to go there. You really want it. And each step you do towards that direction, what you do is to feel lighter, lighter, lighter. Each step you make, you feel lighter because you know you are getting there. **This is what we call resonance.**

**Resonance is when the steps I make are the same frequency, the same vibration, the same energy I need in order to get where I want to arrive.**

This is when all the aspects—the energies of the past, the energies of my present, the energies of the place I'm trying to get, my future—all the energies are aligned in the same frequency.

### When You Walk Against Your Purpose

Let's imagine now the opposite. Imagine a place you don't want to go, but you have to. Somebody make you go there. You say, "No, I don't want to go there. I don't care. I have to go there."

Each step you make is heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier. Why? Because I'm not going into the same direction my spirit, my consciousness, my energy is going. **I'm going to a place that is not mine.**

The more I get closer to that place, the more I start to feel tired, exhausted, "I can't anymore." **This is what we call dissonance.**

Dissonance is when the steps I take are not in the same frequency, are not in the same kind of vibration of the path I should get—my path. I'm going to a path that is not mine.

### Forward Steps, Backward Energy

This is the importance of the knees. That's why I say **when you advance, you don't have to make a physical action.**

You can make a step back, but you can advance. Basically, **your body can go one way, but your consciousness can go the other.**

This is what we have to observe: **When I take a step, am I advancing or I am receding? Am I going back?**

### Unconscious Patterns: Walking Forward While Running Backward

Usually what happens, the unconscious process is we are trying to force ourselves constantly to keep going towards a place, even if it's not ours, without realizing it.

**You can be walking all your life thinking that you are going forward when your consciousness was stuck, trying to run backwards all the time.**

This is one of the main issues we have when we try to go into a path—when we try to find our mission, when we try to find ourselves. We think we need to walk forward physically. We don't realize that maybe we need to go backwards physically in order to go forward spiritually.

This is something we have to analyze within the path of the I Am, within the path of myself. **I have to analyze: Am I advancing, or am I receding?**

### The Task: Recognize Advance and Retreat

The task for today is to try to think about this, to write it down: **When do I feel I'm advancing? When do I feel I am receding?**

It's—yes, it's good to write it down as a list if you need to, but it's more about to think about it. **I advance when... I recede when...**

**To advance doesn't mean to go forward. Advance means to get closer to myself.**

I can say, "I advanced today when I could say no to my boss." You didn't move—you didn't go forward anywhere. You didn't do anything. **You just said no. But in that moment, you advanced into something.**

**Receding would be going backwards from yourself—separating from the I Am.**

I recede when I—I don't know—when I accept something I don't want. When I don't express what I feel. When I lie to myself. When I try to be something I'm not.

### Literal and Metaphorical Steps

We can also say it in a literal way: I advance when I do exercise. I recede when I sit down in my couch all day watching movies.

It can be very, very deep, very philosophical, spiritual. Or it can be very literal, very physical. **Both are important.**

Your knees know the difference. Your knees feel the weight of dissonant movement. Your knees feel the lightness of resonant movement.

## Practice

### Preparation

We start, as always, caressing my body, massaging my body, allowing myself to thank my physical body for being the anchor of my spirit in the matter.

Focus very deep on my breathing. Feel how the air, the oxygen, starts to come through my nose, going to my lungs, my heart, my blood, my organs, my muscles.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Knees

1. **Feel the heat expanding.** Allow myself to feel the heat within my body, how it starts to go out through my skin, filling up my aura, all my magnetical field.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Think about the I Am as a light over my head. With each breathing, bring all the heat, all the energy around my body, towards the I Am, the higher self, as a spiral, feeding the light, making it brighter and brighter and brighter.

3. **Descend through all chakras.** Allow myself to bring the light of the I Am through all my body. Take a deep breath: third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacrum, root, **knees**, feet.

4. **Light the knees.** Feel the light of the I Am within my body, taking all the information from the mind we have worked with all these days. Feel the I Am touching all that information in my knees.

5. **Release history from the knees.** Recognize: What my knees are trying to do is to release all the history that is not mine. I feel the light going through my knees, releasing all the weight, all the memory, all the information that does not belong to me.

6. **Accept only what is mine.** I accept only the wisdom of my ancestors, the strength of my lineage, the knowledge of my path. But I release the burdens that are not mine to carry.

7. **Feel the energy spiral.** From my feet, the energy starts to go out, going up, around my body as an egg of light, surrounding me, coming again to my head. I use my hands if needed to touch it, to feel it, to help it get to my crown. I Am. I Am.

8. **Pronounce the vibration.** Take a deep breath. Start to make the sound, the vibration that comes from my body towards all the directions, towards the eternity of my being: **Nu... Nu... Nu... Nu...**

9. **Declare the statement.** Take a deep breath. Saying it towards all the directions, the eternity of myself: "I am the Emissary of Wise Men. I am the Emissary of Wisdom. I am the Emissary of Wise Men. I am the Emissary of Wisdom."

### Closing

Take a deep breath. We take our hands to our hearts. Recognize: "Each step I take can be an advance or a retreat. I choose to step consciously. I choose to carry only what is mine. I choose to release what belongs to others. I am the Emissary of Wisdom. I am the Emissary of Wise Men."

Take the consciousness with my hands to every part of my body. Stretching, caressing, massaging, yawning, we come back and gently open my eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write or contemplate these statements:

**I advance when...**  
(Examples: I speak my truth. I say no to what doesn't serve me. I honor my boundaries. I do the work even when it's hard. I take time for myself. I follow my intuition.)

**I recede when...**  
(Examples: I agree to things I don't want to do. I hide my feelings. I let others define me. I numb myself with distraction. I ignore my body's signals. I betray my values for approval.)

Be specific. Be honest. Notice patterns.

Also notice: When do your knees hurt? After what kinds of activities or decisions? What were you carrying when the pain started?

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, pay attention to your knees. Literally. When you walk, notice: Do your knees feel light or heavy? Are you moving toward something you want or away from something you fear?

When you make a decision, notice: Does it feel like advancing (getting closer to yourself) or receding (moving away from yourself)?

When you interact with others, notice: Are you stepping forward in your power or stepping backward in people-pleasing?

Physical movement mirrors energetic movement. If you've been sitting too long, physically stuck, your energy is probably stuck too. Sometimes the literal act of taking a walk, consciously placing one foot in front of the other, can unstick the energetic pattern.

Conversely, sometimes you need to physically step backward—leave a job, end a relationship, move back home—in order to spiritually advance toward your true self. Don't let cultural narratives about "progress always means forward" confuse you. Your knees know the truth.

## Q&A

### Q: I have chronic knee pain. Does this mean I'm carrying too much ancestral trauma?

Possibly, but not necessarily only that. Knee pain can be physical (injury, overuse, structural issues), emotional (carrying burdens), energetic (dissonance in life direction), or all three simultaneously. The teaching isn't saying ignore physical causes—get medical help if needed. But ALSO ask the energetic question: "What am I carrying that isn't mine? What direction am I forcing myself to go that isn't my path?" The body is always speaking multiple languages at once.

### Q: How do I release history that's not mine if I don't know what it is?

You don't need to know the specific story. You can simply state the intention: "I release any burdens I'm carrying that don't belong to me. I release any missions I'm trying to complete that aren't mine. I keep only the wisdom and strength of my lineage, and I let go of the suffering." Then feel into your knees and imagine the weight draining out through your feet into the earth. It's not about analyzing every ancestral trauma—it's about energetic release.

### Q: What if I genuinely don't know whether I'm advancing or receding?

Start with your body. When you're doing something, does your body feel lighter or heavier? More alive or more numb? More present or more dissociated? Your knees—and your whole body—know the answer even if your mind doesn't. Also, advancing usually involves some discomfort (growth is uncomfortable) but feels meaningful. Receding might feel comfortable (familiar, safe) but feels empty or wrong at a deeper level.

### Q: Can you give an example of stepping backward physically to advance spiritually?

Quitting a prestigious job to do work you actually care about. Ending a relationship everyone approves of because it's not right for you. Moving out of a big city back to your hometown because that's where you need to be. Dropping out of school to pursue your actual calling. These all look like "failure" or "regression" to outside observers, but internally, they're profound advances toward authenticity.

### Q: What if I'm advancing in some areas and receding in others?

Welcome to being human. That's the whole point of yesterday's teaching about strengths and weaknesses. You're on the mountaintop in some aspects and in the valley in others. The goal isn't to be perfectly advanced in all areas simultaneously—that's impossible. The goal is to be conscious of where you are, so you can move with intention rather than unconsciously.

### Q: How is this different from just "following your passion" or "doing what feels good"?

Advancing isn't always what feels good in the moment—it often involves discomfort, challenge, difficult conversations, hard work. But it feels RIGHT. It feels aligned. It feels like you're moving toward yourself, not away. Receding can feel good temporarily (numbing out feels good, avoiding conflict feels good, people-pleasing gets approval which feels good) but it hollows you out over time. The litmus test isn't pleasure; it's resonance.

### Q: The teaching says knees hold memory of every step. Is this literal or metaphorical?

Both. Metaphorically, yes—your knees energetically hold the memory of your movement through life. But also literally: your body keeps score. The tissue in your knees has been stressed and shaped by every step you've taken. Repetitive patterns wear grooves. Trauma gets stored in fascia. The body remembers everything. This is why somatics—working with the body to release what's stored there—can be so powerful.

### Q: What about people who can't walk? How does this teaching apply?

Movement isn't just physical. Someone in a wheelchair still "advances" and "recedes" energetically. Still moves toward themselves or away. Still carries history in their body (whatever body they have). The knees are a specific example of a broader principle: the body holds memory, and we move through life either in resonance or dissonance with our truth. Apply the principle to whatever capacity of movement you have.

**Note:** Tomorrow, Day 39, we move to the Ankles to work with Destination—the profound teaching that destiny means "to stay," not "to go." The ocean is waiting. Rest well.
