## Overview

Day 118 addresses one of the most emotionally charged and philosophically complex topics in the 365-day journey: **abortion**. But this teaching goes far beyond the clinical or political definition.

**Abortion** comes from Latin roots meaning "to go beyond birth" or "to go beyond origin" (ab/apo = beyond; ortus = birth/origin). At its essence, abortion is **any act of denying, escaping, or abandoning your origin, your responsibility, or your creation**.

This can manifest across multiple dimensions:
- **Physical abortion**: Terminating a pregnancy
- **Psychological abortion**: Abandoning relationships, projects, or commitments
- **Historical abortion**: Denying uncomfortable facts from history
- **Spiritual abortion**: Refusing to acknowledge your soul's chosen path or contracts

The teaching explains that when you deny something or leave something behind without proper integration, it doesn't disappear—it creates **cosmic echoes**. These echoes are distortions that propagate across time, space, and dimensions, creating mirror relationships that repeat the original conflict until it's finally integrated with consciousness.

Matias clarifies that this is **not a judgment** on anyone who has had an abortion or made difficult choices. It's a teaching about **how distortions work universally**, and how freedom combined with education allows us to make conscious choices rather than unconscious ones.

The practice invites deep reflection on where in your life you have "aborted"—denied your origin, escaped your responsibility, or left something incomplete—and how to restore coherence through acknowledgment and integration.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology and Essence of Abortion

To understand abortion beyond its modern medical definition, we must return to its linguistic roots:

**Abortion** = Latin "ab/apo" (beyond, away from) + "ortus" (birth, origin, rising)

Literally: **to go beyond your origin**, to escape from where you came from, to deny your source.

This is the universal definition that applies not just to pregnancy, but to **any situation where you deny, escape, or abandon your origin, responsibility, or creation**.

From this perspective:
- When a nation denies uncomfortable parts of its history, it commits **historical abortion**
- When a person abandons a relationship they co-created, they commit **relational abortion**
- When a soul incarnates but refuses the life plan it chose, it commits **spiritual abortion**
- When a parent emotionally abandons a child while physically present, it commits **psychological abortion**

The teaching is not about morality—it's about **mechanics**. What happens energetically, dimensionally, cosmically when you deny your origin or abandon your creation?

### Denying and Leaving Creates Cosmic Echoes

Here is the key principle:

**When you deny something or leave something, you don't erase it—you create an echo that expands as distortion across dimensions.**

Think of it like throwing a stone in water. The ripples spread outward. If the stone represents a denial or abandonment, the ripples are **distortions**—misalignments, incoherences, conflicts that repeat and amplify through time and space.

Matias explains: "When we talk about abortion, we are basically talking about the result of denying and leaving. When you deny something and you leave, **that something is going to live as an echo in this reality, expanding it in a distorted way through different frequencies and dimensions**."

This is why patterns repeat in families, in cultures, in nations. The original distortion (the denial, the abandonment, the unintegrated pain) creates echoes that ripple forward through generations until someone finally **acknowledges, integrates, and heals** the original wound.

### History as Abortion: The Example of Collective Denial

One of the most powerful examples Matias gives is **how nations handle their histories**:

"What is happening with the Holocaust for example, or with slavery, or with any of the wars that we had—**we are doing a historical abortion**. We are trying to escape the responsibility of that origin. We are denying the facts."

When a culture denies or minimizes its historical violence, trauma, or responsibility:
- The victims' pain becomes an unacknowledged echo
- The descendants carry distortion without understanding why
- The pattern repeats in new forms until it's integrated

This is why historical memory work, truth and reconciliation processes, and collective acknowledgment are so crucial—they **stop the echo** by bringing consciousness to what was denied.

Abortion (as a universal concept) is the choice to escape responsibility for what you created or participated in. Whether it's a pregnancy, a relationship, a historical event, or a soul contract—**escaping it doesn't end it; it distorts it**.

### Mirror Relationships: The Cosmic Echo Returning

One of the most profound teachings in this day is about **mirror relationships**:

When you deny your origin or abandon something you created, that denial creates a distortion. This distortion then **manifests in your life as a mirror**—situations, people, or challenges that reflect back the original unintegrated pattern.

Matias describes it: "If you leave and you deny, **you're going to find constantly relationships that mirror this original conflict** until you integrate it."

For example:
- If you were abandoned as a child and never integrated that pain, you will unconsciously create relationships where you are abandoned again and again
- If you abandoned a creative project without completion, you will find yourself unable to complete future projects
- If you denied your ancestry or cultural origin, you will experience confusion about identity and belonging

These mirrors are not punishments—they are **invitations to integrate what was left unfinished**. The universe keeps presenting the same pattern in new forms until you finally see it, acknowledge it, and heal it.

This is why therapy often revisits childhood wounds, why spiritual work emphasizes "shadow integration," why historical reconciliation requires facing uncomfortable truths—**the echo doesn't stop until it's heard**.

### Soul Contracts vs. Adaptation to Circumstances

A critical distinction Matias makes is between two types of life paths:

**Soul Contracts (Voluntary Planning)**  
Before incarnation, the soul chooses certain experiences, relationships, challenges, and purposes. This is the "contract"—the intentional design of your life path.

When you follow your soul contract, you are **coherent** with your origin and purpose. Even if the path is difficult, there is alignment between your soul's intention and your life experience.

**Adaptation to Circumstances (Involuntary Response)**  
Sometimes life presents circumstances that were **not part of the original soul plan**—accidents, traumas, unexpected events, environmental conditions.

When you adapt to these circumstances, you are responding to something **not originally chosen**. This creates a different energetic signature—not necessarily bad, but different from the original coherence.

Matias explains: "There are two big possibilities of incarnation—**one is voluntary, the other is involuntary**. The voluntary is when you plan your whole life... The involuntary is when things happen to you and you have to adapt."

Now here's the crucial point: **Abortion can happen in both contexts.**

**Voluntary Abortion**: You planned something (a soul contract, a life path, a purpose) and then consciously chose to escape it, deny it, abandon it. This creates distortion because you're going against your own soul's intention.

**Involuntary Abortion**: Something happened to you that wasn't planned (trauma, accident, violation), and you chose to terminate it or leave it. This is adaptation, not denial of your own origin, but it still creates ripples.

The difference is in consciousness and responsibility. Voluntary abortion creates distortion by denying what you yourself chose. Involuntary abortion is a response to external circumstances—it may still have consequences, but the energetic signature is different.

### Abortion Across Dimensions

Matias teaches that abortion is not just a physical-realm concept—it happens across **all dimensions**:

"Abortion doesn't just happen in our reality; **it happens in every dimension in different ways**."

What does this mean?

**Mental Dimension**: Aborting ideas, denying insights, refusing to think certain thoughts, censoring creativity.

**Emotional Dimension**: Suppressing feelings, denying emotional truth, abandoning the feeling body.

**Spiritual Dimension**: Refusing your soul's path, denying your divine origin, escaping your spiritual purpose.

**Physical Dimension**: Terminating pregnancy, abandoning projects, leaving relationships.

**Temporal Dimension**: Denying your past, trying to escape your history, refusing to acknowledge your origins.

In each dimension, the mechanism is the same: **when you deny and leave, you create an echo that distorts reality until it's integrated**.

This is why the teaching emphasizes that abortion is not simply a physical/medical issue—it's a **universal principle about how consciousness relates to creation, responsibility, and integration**.

### Freedom and Education: The Path to Conscious Choice

So what is the solution? How do we address abortion in all its forms without judgment or shame?

Matias offers two interconnected principles: **Freedom and Education**.

**Freedom**: People must have the right to make their own choices about their bodies, their lives, their paths. Forcing someone to carry a pregnancy, stay in a relationship, or follow a life path against their will creates even greater distortion.

Freedom is essential because **conscious choice** is the basis of transformation. You cannot force someone into coherence; they must choose it.

**Education**: People must understand the consequences—not as punishment, but as **how reality works**. When you deny and leave something, it creates an echo. This isn't moral judgment; it's cosmic mechanics.

If you understand this, you can make choices **consciously**—knowing that if you terminate something, leave something, or deny something, you will encounter its echo again. You'll need to integrate it eventually.

Education allows you to say: "I understand that this choice will create ripples. I'm making it anyway, and I take responsibility for integrating those ripples when they return."

That's **conscious abortion**—making a difficult choice with full awareness of its implications, rather than unconsciously denying and fleeing.

Matias emphasizes: "**The goal is not to stop abortion. The goal is to give freedom and education so people can choose consciously what they want to do with their lives, their bodies, their souls**."

This removes shame, guilt, and judgment while still honoring the truth that our choices have consequences that ripple across dimensions.

### The Role of Shame and Guilt

Many people who have had abortions (physical, relational, spiritual) carry tremendous shame and guilt.

The teaching addresses this directly: **Shame and guilt are themselves distortions**—they are ways of denying what happened rather than integrating it.

If you had an abortion and you carry shame:
- You're denying that you made that choice
- You're trying to escape the responsibility
- You're creating a secondary echo on top of the original echo

What's needed is not shame—it's **acknowledgment and integration**.

"I made this choice. I was in this situation. I did what I felt I needed to do. I acknowledge the life or potential that was denied. I honor the pain and complexity. I integrate the experience into my path rather than denying it."

This doesn't mean you celebrate it or feel nothing. It means you **bring it into consciousness** rather than suppressing it.

When you acknowledge and integrate, the echo stops expanding. The distortion begins to heal. The mirror relationships can finally shift.

### Coherence as the Antidote to Distortion

Throughout the teaching, the concept of **coherence** appears as the alternative to abortion/distortion:

**Coherence** = When your actions align with your origin, your choices align with your values, your life aligns with your soul's intention.

When you live coherently:
- You don't need to deny your past; you integrate it
- You don't need to escape responsibility; you embrace it
- You don't create echoes; you create clarity

Coherence doesn't mean perfection. It means **alignment between inner and outer, intention and action, origin and manifestation**.

If you must end something (a pregnancy, a relationship, a project), **doing it coherently** means:
- Acknowledging what you're ending
- Understanding why
- Taking responsibility for the consequences
- Integrating the experience rather than denying it
- Honoring all parties involved

This transforms abortion from "denying and leaving" into **"completing and releasing"**—a very different energetic signature.

## Practice: Origin Awareness and Responsibility Integration

This practice helps you identify where you have "aborted" in your life and begin the process of bringing those echoes back into consciousness for integration.

### Steps

**1. Create Sacred Space**  
Sit comfortably. Light a candle if possible. Breathe deeply, centering yourself in your body.

**2. Invoke Honesty**  
Set the intention: "I am willing to see where I have denied, escaped, or abandoned. I am ready to bring what was left in shadow into the light."

**3. Map Your Origins**  
Reflect on the major "origins" in your life:
- Your family of origin
- Your cultural/ethnic heritage
- Relationships you co-created
- Projects you started
- Creative works you initiated
- Children (born or unborn)
- Spiritual callings or paths

**4. Identify the Abortions**  
For each origin, honestly ask: "Did I deny this? Did I escape responsibility? Did I leave without integration?"

Notice what arises without judgment. This is not about shame—it's about seeing clearly.

**5. Feel the Echo**  
For each abortion you identify, ask: "Where does this pattern repeat in my life? Where do I encounter mirrors of this original conflict?"

Notice the relationships, situations, or challenges that reflect the unintegrated pattern.

**6. Acknowledge Out Loud**  
Speak aloud what you denied or abandoned:
- "I denied my father's lineage."
- "I abandoned my creative work."
- "I escaped from that relationship without completion."
- "I terminated a pregnancy."
- "I refused my soul's calling."

Let yourself hear your own voice speaking truth.

**7. Honor What Was Lost**  
For whatever was aborted—a life, a relationship, a dream, a path—pause and honor it.

"I acknowledge that this existed. I honor what could have been. I recognize the life force that was involved."

**8. Take Responsibility**  
Without self-blame, take responsibility:
"I made this choice. I was part of this. I participated in this. I take responsibility for the consequences."

**9. Ask for Integration**  
Place your hands on your heart and ask:
"How can I integrate this? What wants to be healed? What echo is ready to stop?"

Listen. Wait. Be receptive.

**10. Visualize Coherence Restoration**  
Imagine a golden thread connecting you to whatever you denied or abandoned.

See the thread repairing, the light flowing both ways, the distortion resolving into clarity.

**11. Commitment**  
Make a commitment:
"I will no longer deny this. I will no longer escape this. I will integrate this into my path with consciousness."

**12. Release with Gratitude**  
Thank whatever was aborted for the teaching it brought. Release it with love, acknowledging that integration doesn't mean holding on—it means completing the cycle.

**13. Return**  
Breathe deeply. Feel your body. Come back to the present moment.

Blow out the candle if you lit one.

**14. Integration Action**  
Within the next 24 hours, take one concrete action toward integrating what you discovered:
- Write a letter (you don't have to send it)
- Visit a place connected to the origin
- Speak to someone involved
- Create a ritual of acknowledgment
- Make a financial amends
- Change a pattern consciously

## Key Insights

- Abortion means "going beyond origin"—any denial or abandonment of what you created or where you came from
- When you deny and leave something, you don't erase it—you create cosmic echoes that expand as distortion
- Historical abortion (denying collective past) creates intergenerational trauma and repeated patterns
- Mirror relationships appear when you've left something unintegrated—they reflect the original conflict
- Soul contracts are voluntary (planned before birth); adaptation to circumstances is involuntary
- Abortion happens across all dimensions—mental, emotional, spiritual, physical, temporal
- Voluntary abortion (denying your own plan) creates different distortion than involuntary (responding to circumstances)
- Freedom and education together allow conscious choice rather than unconscious denial
- Shame and guilt are secondary distortions—they deny what happened rather than integrating it
- Acknowledgment stops the echo; integration heals the distortion
- Coherence (alignment between inner/outer) is the antidote to abortion/distortion
- You cannot force coherence—it must be chosen freely with full understanding
- Making difficult choices consciously (with awareness of consequences) is different from unconsciously fleeing
- Completing and releasing (with integration) is energetically different from denying and leaving
- The goal is not to prevent all abortion but to ensure freedom with education for conscious choice

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Responsibility Inventory

Each day this week, ask yourself: "Where today did I deny something, escape responsibility, or leave something incomplete?" Notice the small abortions—cutting off a conversation, abandoning a commitment, denying a feeling. Practice completing what you start, even in tiny ways.

### Weekly Focus: One Echo Integration

Choose one "abortion" from your past—something you denied or abandoned. This week, take steps to integrate it: acknowledge it honestly, feel the feelings you avoided, take responsibility without shame, and complete the cycle in whatever way is possible now.

### Living the Teaching

Before making significant choices this week—especially choices to end, leave, or deny something—pause and ask: "Am I making this choice consciously, understanding the echoes it will create? Or am I unconsciously fleeing?" This doesn't mean you won't make the same choice, but you'll make it coherently rather than reactively.

## Questions & Reflections

**Q: Is this teaching saying abortion is wrong or sinful?**

No. The teaching explicitly states this is not about morality or judgment. It's about mechanics—how denial and abandonment create distortions that ripple across dimensions. The teaching advocates for freedom (the right to choose) combined with education (understanding consequences). You can choose abortion and integrate it consciously, which creates very different outcomes than choosing abortion and denying it shamefully.

**Q: What if I had an abortion years ago and carry tremendous guilt? Is it too late to heal?**

It's never too late. The echo is still active (which is why you feel the guilt), which means it's ready to be integrated. The practice in this teaching offers steps: acknowledge what happened, honor what was lost, take responsibility without self-blame, and consciously integrate the experience into your path. Many people find profound healing by transforming guilt into conscious acknowledgment.

**Q: Does this mean if I leave a toxic relationship, I'm "aborting" and will face negative consequences?**

Context matters. Leaving a relationship for your safety, growth, or well-being is not the same as unconsciously fleeing responsibility. The key is: Are you leaving with consciousness, acknowledgment, and completion? Or are you denying your participation and escaping without integration? Conscious completion doesn't create the same distortion as unconscious abandonment.

**Q: What about miscarriage? Is that a form of abortion creating echoes?**

Miscarriage is not a choice to deny or abandon—it's an involuntary biological event. However, unintegrated grief from miscarriage can create echoes. The healing is the same: acknowledge what was lost, honor the life that briefly existed, feel the feelings, integrate the experience. The distortion comes from denial, not from the loss itself.

**Q: How can I tell the difference between a "soul contract" and just adaptation to circumstances?**

Soul contracts often have a quality of deep resonance, even when difficult—a sense of "this is what I'm here to do." Adaptation feels more reactive—"this happened to me; now I must respond." But many lives involve both. The key is not to judge one as better, but to recognize which you're experiencing so you can respond consciously.

**Q: If I denied my cultural heritage or family origin, how do I integrate that now?**

Start with curiosity. Learn about what you denied. Talk to elders. Explore traditions. Acknowledge honestly: "I rejected this part of myself." Then consciously choose what to reclaim and what to release—but from a place of acknowledgment, not denial. You don't have to embrace everything, but you must acknowledge the origin.

**Q: What if acknowledging my "abortions" brings up overwhelming grief or pain?**

This is sacred work that may require support. Consider working with a therapist, spiritual counselor, or trusted guide. The grief is the echo finally being heard—it's painful, but it's also healing. You don't have to do it alone. Integration happens in layers; you don't have to process everything at once.

**Q: Can a society or nation "integrate" historical abortions like slavery or genocide?**

Yes, through truth-telling, reparations, education, memorials, and systemic change. Germany's approach to the Holocaust is an example—acknowledging rather than denying, educating rather than suppressing, taking responsibility rather than escaping. The echo stops when the truth is integrated into collective consciousness.

## Closing Reflection

Today you have learned that abortion is not simply a medical or political term—it is a **universal principle** about how consciousness relates to creation, origin, and responsibility.

Whenever you deny where you came from, abandon what you created, or escape responsibility for your participation, you generate an echo—a distortion that ripples across time, space, and dimensions until it is finally acknowledged and integrated.

These echoes return as mirror relationships, repeated patterns, unresolved conflicts, and the persistent feeling that "this keeps happening to me." They return not as punishment but as **invitation**—the universe asking you to finally see, acknowledge, and integrate what was left in shadow.

You have also learned that the solution is not shame, guilt, or the prevention of all abortion. The solution is **freedom combined with education**—the right to make your own choices about your body, your life, and your path, combined with the understanding that your choices create ripples.

When you choose consciously—acknowledging what you're ending, understanding why, taking responsibility for the consequences, and committing to integration—you transform abortion from "denying and leaving" into "completing and releasing."

This doesn't make difficult choices easy. But it makes them coherent.

If you are carrying the weight of past denials, abandonments, or abortions—whether physical, relational, spiritual, or historical—this teaching offers you a path: **Stop denying. Start acknowledging. Stop escaping. Start integrating. Stop creating echoes. Start creating coherence.**

The life you terminated, the relationship you abandoned, the heritage you denied, the calling you escaped—these are not gone. They are alive as echoes, waiting for you to finally turn and face them, to honor what was, to take responsibility for what you chose, and to integrate the experience into your wholeness.

You cannot change the past. But you can change your relationship to it. You can stop the echo. You can heal the distortion. You can restore coherence.

And when you do, you will find that the mirrors stop appearing, the patterns stop repeating, and the path forward becomes clear—not because you are perfect, but because you are finally **whole**, having integrated even what you once denied.

Acknowledge your origins. Take responsibility for your creations. Complete what you began. And when you must end something, do it consciously, coherently, with full awareness of the ripples you're creating—and the commitment to integrate them when they return.

This is how echoes become wisdom. This is how distortion becomes clarity. This is how abortion becomes integration.
