## Overview

Day 101 marks a special threshold following the 11/11 portal of Day 100. The number 101 mirrors the coat worn by the beings from the Interterranean City—the inner city of the world—who guided the gatherings in Argentina in 2011 and 2018. Their message "Love Humans Love" connects directly to today's teaching on humor and laughter.

This teaching reveals that humor is not merely about feeling happy or experiencing emotion—it is about calibration and balance. Our physical body needs and finds balance through humor, and our energetic bodies find coherence and balance through laughter. To love is not only to feel fine but to align ourselves.

We explore the fascinating etymology of "humor" and discover that it originates from the concept of "wet lands" (humus, humanity). Ancient philosophies taught that humans were made from four different types of wet lands within the body: blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Later, a Roman physician added a fifth wet land—the pneuma in the lungs, which represents spirit and breathing. This fifth essence became connected to the soul (psyche in Greek), and thus the concept of humor transformed from physical wet lands to the attributes of the soul and emotions.

## Core Teaching

### The Origin of Humor: From Wet Lands to Soul

The word "humor" comes from "human," and human comes from "wet land"—water and earth, like mud or clay. In ancient mythologies, humans are made of clay or mud. This is why we are called humans: we come from the wet lands.

Because of this understanding, ancient mythologies and philosophies believed that we as humans were made from humidity. All the things we have inside are different types of wet lands. These different wet lands within our body are four:

1. **Blood**
2. **Phlegm** (the liquid in the lungs and respiratory system)
3. **Black bile**
4. **Yellow bile**

These are the four wet lands of our body, which the Romans called the **four humors**.

Many years later, a physician from the Roman Empire said there should be another wet land, and this liquid is in the lungs. The lungs are the ones that breathe, and breathing in Latin is called "spirare"—the origin of the word "spirit." 

In that time, the concept of spirit wasn't really used; they used the concept of soul. The soul in Greek is called "psyche," which is the origin of the word psychology (and psychiatrist, psycho—all related to soul).

This physician said the soul is breathing, so this should be the **fifth essence**—the quintessence. The fifth essence of the body, the fifth wet land, is what they called **pneuma** (the breath in the lungs). This is the fifth humor, the humor of the soul.

### From Physical Humor to Emotional Humor

This is how people started to attach the concept of "humor" to the attributes of the soul—to the wet land, the humanity of the soul, which is emotions. The whole history shows us how "humor" became what we now call the different attributes of the soul.

It's very important to understand this origin because we are talking about humor in the aspect of the soul, in the energy of Scorpio. Scorpio is the zodiac sign related to dark water—the water that holds all the dark emotions, everything we have inside that we cannot see as visible.

### Humor as Calibration and Balance

One of the key messages from the 11/11 gatherings was "Love Humans Love." This connects directly to laughter, because it's not only important for our culture and ourselves to feel happy when we do things—it's not only about emotion, but also about **calibration**.

Our physical body needs and finds balance through humor. And the energetic bodies also find coherence and balance through laughter. **To love is not only to feel fine, but also to align ourselves.**

When we laugh, when we experience genuine humor, we are not just experiencing an emotion—we are calibrating our entire system. The wet lands within us—our fluids, our energies, our emotions—are finding their proper balance. This is why laughter is so healing, so essential to our wellbeing.

### The Fifth Essence: Spirit and Soul

The concept of the fifth essence (quintessence) is profound. While the four humors represent the physical wet lands of the body, the fifth essence—the pneuma, the breath—represents something beyond the physical. It is the bridge between body and spirit.

In Greek, the soul is "psyche," and this is where we get all our psychological concepts. The soul is breathing. Every breath we take connects us to the fifth essence, to the quintessence of our being. When we work with breath, we work with the soul itself.

This is why breathwork is so central to spiritual practice—not because breathing is "spiritual" in some abstract sense, but because the breath literally is the fifth wet land, the fifth humor, the essence of the soul manifesting in the physical body.

### Scorpio and Dark Water

Today we are in Scorpio, which is the zodiac sign that is related with dark water. This is the water that holds all our dark emotions—everything we have inside that we cannot see as visible. 

Just as the ancient physicians understood that there were hidden wet lands within the body (bile, phlegm, blood), so too are there hidden emotional waters within us. Scorpio governs these deep, dark, invisible waters—the emotions we carry beneath the surface, the feelings we don't always acknowledge or express.

Humor, in the Scorpio sense, is about acknowledging all of these wet lands, all of these waters—both light and dark. It's about finding balance not just in the emotions we're comfortable with, but in all of them.

### The Emotional Week in Scorpio

We are now entering the emotional week of Scorpio, which means we will be diving deep into the dark waters of emotion over the coming days. This week is about exploring the humidity of our soul—all the different emotional wet lands we carry.

The teaching on humor sets the foundation for this week by reminding us that emotions are not problems to be solved but wet lands to be balanced. Just as the ancient physicians understood that all four humors needed to be in proper proportion for health, we too need all our emotions—light and dark, comfortable and uncomfortable—to be in proper balance for spiritual and emotional health.

## Practice

### Laughter as Calibration

This is not a formal meditation but a practice to integrate throughout your day:

**Morning Practice:**
- Upon waking, before you do anything else, laugh deliberately for 30 seconds
- It doesn't have to be genuine laughter at first—just make the sound and movement
- Notice how your body responds, how your energy shifts
- Recognize that you are calibrating your wet lands, balancing your humors

**Throughout the Day:**
- When you notice tension or imbalance, return to laughter
- Even forced laughter creates physiological changes that lead to balance
- Pay attention to what makes you genuinely laugh—these are your calibration points
- Notice the connection between breath and laughter—both are the fifth essence

**Evening Reflection:**
- Before sleep, consider: What emotions (wet lands) did I experience today?
- Did I allow all of them, or did I try to suppress some?
- Can I find humor (balance) even in the darker emotions?
- Breathe deeply, connecting with the pneuma, the fifth essence

### Working with the Four Humors

Ancient practice updated for modern understanding:

1. **Blood** (represents vitality, life force):
   - Notice your energy levels throughout the day
   - Are you depleted or overflowing?
   - Laughter replenishes the blood

2. **Phlegm** (represents flow, ease):
   - Notice where you feel stuck or flowing
   - Laughter loosens what is stuck

3. **Yellow Bile** (represents fire, passion):
   - Notice your enthusiasm and drive
   - Laughter tempers excess fire, ignites dampened flames

4. **Black Bile** (represents depth, melancholy):
   - Notice your darker emotions
   - Laughter doesn't eliminate darkness but brings it into balance

5. **Pneuma/Spirit** (represents breath, soul):
   - Notice your breathing
   - Laughter is breath accelerated, spirit in motion
   - Each laugh is a prayer of the fifth essence

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Humor Inventory:**
Each day this week, track your four humors:
- What is the state of your blood (vitality)?
- What is the state of your phlegm (flow)?
- What is the state of your yellow bile (fire)?
- What is the state of your black bile (depth)?
- What is the state of your pneuma (breath/spirit)?

Use laughter to calibrate whatever is out of balance.

### Weekly Focus

As we move through the emotional week of Scorpio, remember that we are working with dark water—the invisible emotions within. The teaching on humor reminds us that even in darkness, even in the depths, there is the possibility of laughter, of calibration, of balance.

The ancient physicians knew that health required all four humors in proper proportion. We can update this wisdom: emotional health requires all emotions in proper proportion. Nothing needs to be eliminated—everything needs to be balanced.

### Living the Teaching

The message "Love Humans Love" is not sentimental—it is practical. When we love (align, calibrate, balance) ourselves as humans (wet lands, humors, embodied souls), we can love (align, calibrate, balance) others. Laughter is one of the most direct paths to this alignment.

Don't wait to feel joyful before you laugh. Laugh to create the calibration that allows joy to flow. Remember: humor is not the emotion—humor is the wet land that makes all emotions possible, the fifth essence that bridges body and spirit.

## Q&A

**Q: If humor comes from wet lands and the four humors, does that mean our emotions are purely physical?**

A: Not purely physical, but they have a physical component. The four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, yellow bile) are physical substances, but the fifth essence—pneuma, the breath—is the bridge to the soul. Emotions exist at the intersection of the physical wet lands and the spiritual breath. This is why physical changes (laughter, breathwork) can shift emotional states, and why emotional states affect our physical body.

**Q: How do I know which humor is out of balance in me?**

A: Notice your predominant states. If you're constantly exhausted, your blood (vitality) may be depleted. If you feel stuck and congested, your phlegm (flow) needs attention. If you're overly reactive and hot-tempered, yellow bile (fire) is excessive. If you're melancholic and heavy, black bile (depth) is dominant. If you feel disconnected from spirit, pneuma (breath) needs cultivation. Laughter helps calibrate all of them.

**Q: Why is laughter connected to calibration rather than just happiness?**

A: Because laughter creates physiological changes that restore balance regardless of your emotional starting point. When you laugh, your diaphragm moves, your breath deepens, your circulation increases, and your nervous system shifts. These are calibration mechanisms—they bring your system back to center. Happiness is one possible result, but calibration happens even if you don't feel happy.

**Q: What does "Love Humans Love" really mean?**

A: It's a multilayered message. First, love humans (as in, love humanity, love people). Second, love is what humans do—it's our nature as wet lands seeking balance. Third, love (the verb) humans (ourselves and others) into a state of love (alignment, calibration, balance). It's a call to use love as a calibrating force, recognizing that we are all made of the same wet lands seeking the same balance.

**Q: How is Scorpio's dark water different from other water signs?**

A: Cancer's water is protective and nurturing (like amniotic fluid). Pisces' water is dissolving and transcendent (like the ocean). Scorpio's water is dark, deep, and hidden—it's the water we carry inside that no one sees, the emotional bile and phlegm, the wet lands we keep concealed. Scorpio asks us to acknowledge and balance these invisible waters.

**Q: Can I work with the four humors even if I don't understand them medically?**

A: Yes. Think of them metaphorically: Blood = life force/vitality. Phlegm = flow/ease. Yellow bile = fire/passion. Black bile = depth/melancholy. Pneuma = breath/spirit. You don't need to understand ancient medicine to notice when you feel drained (blood), stuck (phlegm), overheated (yellow bile), heavy (black bile), or disconnected (pneuma). Use laughter to rebalance whichever quality is out of harmony.

**Q: Why did the ancient physician add a fifth humor instead of keeping it at four?**

A: Because the four humors explained the body, but not the soul. The physician recognized that breathing (pneuma/spirit) was different from the other wet lands—it was the interface between physical body and soul (psyche). This fifth essence was necessary to complete the picture: body needs soul, and soul needs breath to manifest in body. The quintessence is the bridge.

**Q: Is there a "right" amount of each humor to have?**

A: Balance is individual and changes with circumstances. A warrior needs more blood (vitality) and yellow bile (fire). A contemplative needs more phlegm (ease) and black bile (depth). Someone in transition needs strong pneuma (spirit/breath) to navigate change. The "right" amount is whatever serves your current path and purpose. Laughter helps you find YOUR balance, not some universal ideal.

## Closing Reflection

Today marks the beginning of a profound journey into the emotional wet lands of Scorpio. We start not with diving into darkness but with understanding the nature of humor itself—the very substance of our emotional being.

As you move through this day and this week, remember the 101 portal code. Remember "Love Humans Love." Remember that you are made of wet lands, that your emotions are humors seeking balance, that your laughter is calibration, and that your breath is the fifth essence connecting all of it to soul.

The ancient wisdom of the four humors is not outdated—it is foundational. Updated with our modern understanding, it reminds us that we are not just thinking beings or feeling beings, but wet beings, humid beings, beings made of water and earth seeking balance in all our elements.

Laugh today. Breathe deeply. Calibrate your humors. Love yourself as the wet land you are, and love others as the wet lands they are. This is the beginning of the emotional week in Scorpio.

*Welcome to Day 101. Welcome to the humidity of your soul.*
