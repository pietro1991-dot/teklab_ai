## Introduction

Good morning , good afternoon , good evening. I hope it is fine you well.

Today it 's starting to be more cold here. It 's starting to be cooler here in Egypt.

So this is why I dress up more. And of course today is about humor.

So I guess I dress up like a town.

So today is the one of the elements. And it 's a special coat because all the gatherings that we did for 11 , 11 , like yesterday. The ones that we did in Argentina in 2011 and 2018 , where all guided by an interterennial , the inner city of the world. And they have this coat , which is a bar circle bar , like 101.

## Energy Work

And that 's the coat of the portal that they used to communicate with the people.

So today , today we are connected with 101 after the portal of 11 , so it 's all perfect. And also one of the messages that they used to say to us in those days was Love Humans , Love. Which is also related with the topic for today , which is humor.

So I wrote about this in the blog today , but I just wanted to point about this , which is that this means in the days 11 , 11 , they remind us about laughter , because it 's not only important for our culture , for ourselves to be , or to feel like happy when we do things. It 's not only about emotion , but it 's also about calibration , calibration , because our physical body is needs and finds balance through humor. And the energetic bodies too , they find coherence and balance through the laughter.

So , to Love is not only to feel fine , but it 's also to to align ourselves. That would be okay. Well , so Love Humans Love.

So let 's begin by humor , from where humor comes from.

Something important to understand about humor , the origin of the word humor. The origin of the word humor comes from human. And remember that human comes from from wet land , okay?

So water and earth , so it 's like mud , clay from what we are done. In the mythology , they say humans are made of clay or mud , okay? That 's why we are humans , because we come from the wet lands , wet lands.

So because of this in ancient mythologies and philosophies , they set and they thought that we , as humans , were made from humidity , okay?

So all the things that we have inside are different types of wet lands. And this different wet lands that we have inside are four. One is the is a blood , the other one is the flame , the other one is the black bills and the other one is the yellow bills. By list , bills , I do n't know how to say it.

So these are the four wet lands of our body , which are the four humanities of our body. This is why in Rome they call it the four humor , four humor , okay?

## Guided Meditation

So many years later , a physician from the Roman Empire , he said that it should be another one and this liquid wet land is in the lungs. And the lungs are the one that breathe and breathing in Latin , you may say , pirate and pirate is the origin of the word spirit , okay? In that time , the concept of spirit was n't really used , they used the concept of soul , okay?

So the soul in the Greek language , we call it sikh and sikh is the origin of the word psychology , okay? Psychology , psychiatrists , all the sikh , sikh , psycho , okay? All this words are related to soul , okay?

So he said the soul is breathing , so this should be the fifth essence , the quintessence they call it , and the fifth essence of the body , the fifth wet land would be the loss that they call gnéoma , gnéoma.

So here is the fifth wet land that we call the fifth humor and that 's the humor of the soul , sikh is the fifth humor.

So this is how the people start to attach the concept of humor to the humor , to the attribute of the soul , to the wet land , the humanity of the soul , which is emotions.

So this is how we now call humor the different attributes of the soul , okay? But now we see the whole history of how it became that.

So I guess it 's very important to understand the origin of humor , aside from explain now , because we are talking about humor in the aspect of the soul , in the energy of the scorpion.

So remember that scorpion is the sodium sign that is related with the dark water , the one that is holding all the dark emotions , everything that we have inside that we can not see in visible.

So the dark waters , the dirty waters , that are scorpion.

So if we understand the origin of the word humor , we will understand that since the very beginning , the mood of the soul was related to the dark waters that we have within.

Okay , so another important thing to understand , that if we understand that humor , basically is talking about the waters that we have inside that gives us life.

So humor is very important for us to keep living , to live , basically. I 'm not looking at the humor 's part of the body and the body is trying to survive. We have to understand that the four humans , the four humor that we have inside , are related to the physical body.

Okay , and then we have another one , the last humor that is related to the soul. And we have to remember this , that the body is the body believes that it is limited and the the energy of the body believes it 's eternal.

So our ethereal aspect , the energy of the aspect , once one thing , once the transcendence , while the body moves forth survival.

Okay , so the body tries to hold everything and survive and the energy of the soul is trying to expand and transcend , totally different paths.

So in the physical body , we have four different humor trying to make the body survive as much as possible. And the other one , the only one for the soul is the one trying to transcend. What we do in our daily life , everything that we do living biologically in our history is absorbing information , constant information. But all that information that we receive is storage in our inner waters.

Because the mostly 70 % of all the information that we have inside is from the subconscious.

So it 's the deep waters of the subconscious related to Scorpio. The rest , the unconscious and the conscience are very tiny compared to the big amount of information that we hold in the subconscious , which is the dark waters from within.

So all the information that makes us be what we are is in those waters.

So what happens? That the 70 % of our mind is trying to survive constantly because the four waters will try to do everything as possible to keep us alive.

So it will use all this data , all this information from around to in its own benefit , which is survival.

So basically what the subconscious would do is to earn energy and to save energy. We have spoken about this. We have spoken about about storage energy.

So what the body is trying to do is if there is any problem outside , if there is any conflict in the outer world , if it does n't deserve my attention , because it 's not a specific problem that I would have.

So my body would say , do n't touch it. Do n't worry about it. I want waste any energy in that conflict if it is not mine. The soul says , oh , I want to solve this problem.

I want to go and do something and transcend and to prove and to learn. But it 's only one against four.

Okay , these are the four. Inside , these are the four humor. How are trying to make you survive and be safe as possible?

So any conflict around , it 's not my problem unless it 's really , really my problem and I have to put energy on it.

So imagine this that our body basically does n't want to waste energy in anything because it wants to survive. But our brain was designed to solve problems.

So our brain is saying I need something to solve and it 's something to find balance to find a equilibrium. But the body says , I do n't want. I just want to sleep to stay calm and not do anything that is not for me.

So what is our brain doing? It takes the mind and uses the mind to create parallel realities.

So it could solve problems in different realities which are not real. It 's just an illusion.

So the brain starts to design solutions problems that does n't exist. This ability that the brain has to create different realities that are not true is basically the main key that makes us be what we are humans. Humans are able to create , to be creative. This is the basis of every culture , of every religion , of every society , every science , every discovery , every art , everything is basically trying to solve problems that are not real.

And that 's basically the most important thing that we have , the invention , the ability to create , so this ability is the one that can create a thousand solutions for only one problem because the brain creates a thousand problems that are being solved at the same time. And that 's what makes us be intelligent. And one of those main attributes of the mind is humor because humor is the ability to create parallel realities. Is the ability to create realities or situations that are not real by themselves?

So when I say about humor , remember that we have five humor.

So it 's not just to make jokes and laugh. It 's about maybe my humor is really bad. I am really angry all the time. Collar melancholy humor.

We have five.

So in each one of these five humor , I can create parallel realities. And this is what starts to create all the different types of moods of humor.

So remember that there are four humor that looks for survival and one humor that looks for transcendence. These four humor that are trying to make us survive are the four humorous that create parallel realities in order to make us create different ideas in order to not to face the real problems that we have.

So basically what these four humor are doing is to deny an external reality and create a new one parallel to the main one.

So for example , there is this humor which is the melancholy humor. This melancholy humor basically is a lot of sadness and the people that lives with that humor usually create parallel realities like different realities that they are very very heavy. And they just see everything in a dark way.

So they do that in order to not to face their own real problems.

So for example , we have different types of humor. Of course , the different moods that we have , but let 's call it humor because it 's the correct thing for where we are talking now. The different humor we have for example , one of them is the melancholy one. The other one is the lim one , I do n't know how to say it.

Another one is the cleric.

So the cleric is one of the most used today. But the cleric for example , you have a cleric person. It 's someone that has a humor to that it 's always like , like always mad with everything. That 's that humor.

Always mad.

So the body says , I do n't want to waste energy fighting with anything any problem around.

So what does this? It takes a mood that we call the dark.

So it does n't start to sound. It 's dark mood. We would say when we do these headphones , like this kind of humor , it comes from the cleric. Because the brain says , if I laugh about this heavy thing that makes me mad , so I kind of solve it.

I kind of resolve it when I am laughing about it. In our times , in our society today , we use a lot the black humor , the dark humor. And we use the dark humor because black humor , whatever. We use that all around the globe.

Because there are so many problems , so many wars and problems , conflicts that we have around everywhere. And we can see all of them that we activate the cleric humor. We are angry all the time as a humanity.

So this is why we activate the black humor. Because our brain stays , I kind of solve it.

So somehow , if I laugh about it , I solve it.

So remember , that there is another thing. Humor basically is something that we use to survive.

So remember , in a few days ago , we have spoken about something that also was used to protect ourselves , which is poison , venom.

So that humor is the one that we have to learn to make medicine from.

So in order to find the medicine , we have this humor , which is the soul humor. And the humor of the soul is to expand itself , it 's not to survive.

So if this four are the ones trying to protect me and to make me escape from the conflicts of life , this other one will be the one helping me to transcend and to expand in life.

So this humor is the one that first of all helped me to laugh of myself. Is it one that allows you to laugh from your own self , laugh of life and enjoy , like by laughing? When someone learns how to laugh from itself , it 's when we start to connect with the soul.

So basically , these four humor are the ones that tries to protect you.

So when you are trying to protect yourself , you wo n't laugh to your own witness , because you are trying to protect your witness.

So you are laughing from the outside. But when you start to learn how to laugh about yourself , you recognize that there is no witness to protect. That the only way you can transcend that witness is by expanding yourself.

So I hope that with this , we can understand the history of humor and how to use it.

So the people that does n't usually have humor , the people that is very serious and does n't have humor at all , usually they are very weak inside , because they do n't have the they need something to feel the potential , like they do n't want to use the balance of because they feel weak inside.

So that 's why some people does n't have humor. And of course , there is the opposite with people that use comedy , the comedian , for example , that usually most of them , they are very people that have suffer a lot. The day they have suffering inside , and they use the laughter as a way to protect themselves. Basically , who takes life very seriously ca n't arrive anywhere.

And the people who love too much , they wo n't be able to listen properly.

So there was a time that there was a being from the seventh dimension in the channel that he said , usually people , some people believe that to reach the enlightenment in the seventh dimension , you have to mediate a lot and to be very serious and doing this and constantly be very straight like this. And they said , but that 's not how you reach enlightenment. Basically , from the fifth dimension , from the seventh dimension , when we see a human doing like this , it 's like a bunch of atoms like in this position like this and nothing else.

So basically , this is just for balance and alignment. This is for another thing , but not for the enlightenment.

So in the seventh dimension , everyone is laughing because laughter is expansion. This is why we have to love much more.

So every day , now we are doing these alignments because we are trying to align ourselves , but we have to mix it with some laughter too.

So I know that there 's a lot of people in spiritual world that they are very like serious and they feel like everything must be very dr. Ner and so on. But that 's useful for one part of the path. The doctrine , the dogma , is to be quiet and serious is useful for a part of it , for a part of the path.

But then , when you have to expand the universe , the dogma will catch you.

Okay? You have to expand and basically to feel the whole universe is basically like such a huge laughter with an orgasm and you can control that with anything. It happens like that.

So relax.

So we have to love a little more. Let 's go to the alignment.

## Q&A

Some people were asking about the talk. How do you call it in English? Obsession , compulsive obsession , obsessive disease , something like that , maybe.

So that we would say is basically what I explained already. It 's a disorder that basically is you 're few more trying to protect yourself from the problems that you do n't know how to solve.

So this is why the brain creates like something to protect themselves from that problem. But I explained better in the blog. If you read the blog , you will have it more explained.

Another thing about humor is that we have heard about a lot about the limits of humor. And there 's no limits in humor because humor is a projection and perception from the soul.

So the soul is expansion. That 's the most important thing.

So if it 's expansion , so there 's no limit. We can not put a limit into humor. If I do n't like humor , some kind of humor , it does n't mean that that humor is bad. It means that it 's not in the same vibration as me.

That 's it.

Okay , putting limits to the humor basically is like saying that the mental institution , health , mental institutions are useful for the mental diseases. It 's something like that. There 's no limits in humor. There 's only different charts from where you express humor.

So another thing of bullying. The concept of bullying. It 's very difficult to say exactly what is bullying because as the humor is there 's no limits in the bullying because any joke can be bullying depending the perception of the person.

Okay , so for some people , some jokes that I do with my friends is bullying for other people is simple friends doing jokes.

So it really depends what is bullying. But basically what we have to understand is that we are putting today too much attention to the person that receives the bullying , then the person that makes the bullying. And bullying , which is a different kind of humor , this bullying is born from the four humor that are all about survival.

So the person that makes the bullying is a very weak person within that needs to survive and before something happens to him attacks is like an animal that attacks just in case.

Okay , that 's the bullying.

So what we have to do is to work with the person that makes the bullying to see what are their weakness and how to solve it because the problem is not the bull is the bully.

Okay , so we have to work not punishing the bully , but healing the bully. That 's an important perception. About the message from yesterday , I will speak about it tomorrow because otherwise it would be very long. The vibration for today is va.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the divine transportation. The code for today is the fifth dimension. The dimension of masters is the projection of unity through time and space. For once , the process of the material entity is done.

The fifth point marks a new level a contemplation point , the top of the pyramid of four bases. The one that sees it all is the plain known as heaven or the place where guides , masters and angels observe and guides in the process without any time or space. Close your eyes , observing , only your breathing. Letting all the weight of your shoulders solve that around , breathing in , breathing out.

Take a deep breath. Take you moment to think and imagine all the people that you know. Teacher all of them around you. The closest ones and those who are very far the last ones , in which you can think about the good people and the bad people , those who have heard of you and those who make you good.

All of them around you. And I become aware that the light of the sun , the light of the eye on , that surrounds me , it 's also surrounding all of them equally. I perceive the light between each one of them. With my eyes closed , I move my head around to watch all these people.

I can see different people at every place that I see that I watch. And all of them are surrounded by the light.

Now I realize that the light that is shining comes from within , from my inner body , from my own self , shining brighter on each one of those around me. I see my brightest , shining from them , like the light in the waves of the sea. And I recognize that each one of them is a wave in this ocean. I am water.

Take a deep breath and my fists. I desire to find the true humor of my soul and for that I descend to the depth of the soul. Take a deep breath and go deep. They are saving how the light is above and you are heading to the darkness of the ocean.

I feel the pressure of the water in my body , a sight is sent deeper and deeper. Around me , there is only darkness. I feel the pressure of all the people that create the waves of my sea. And I perceive that all the pressure that I receive , good and bad , positive or negative.

I am the divine confrontation. I am the divine confrontation. Smile. Under the pressure of all the people I know , under the pressure of them conscious , some subconscious.

I see the emptiness of the darkness of the ocean. Les nabla , la antique funding , in hombre indica , y estado lambda , por nuestra energyía. Wai , minas , la nueva humanidad , a query , que ha vendor , a pasa de la hler. A la vida.

Sandra , ni , sandra ni , estado. Pests de las profundidades , de las hamas y las tierra. Oslo , tenets , así como vosotros. Nossa , tenéis en nosotros.

Sandra , ni , sandra ni , estado. Brian , humans. Brian , humans. Brian , humans.

Nuestra , las lists , serán nominals por la eternidad. Brian , humans. Brian , humans. In the name of Intact.

She was called by our energy.

Today , from the unit the small tents , with the energy of the Andes. To connect from the sea and the mountains , their children 's , the needy-mante. She said , You are the kids. We are the kids that have come here to transform the idea into life.

And for that , they support us as we support them. And she reminds us , Love , humans , love , humans , love , humans. And your laughter will be heard beyond to the certainty. Take a deep breath.

I take my hands to my heart. And from there , I begin to press into a sash , to chest , and all the body coming back here and now. And each one at its own time , open your eyes.

So thank you everyone for being there. And so this is how our emotional week and scorpion begins. See you tomorrow. Staying time as always.

Bye.
