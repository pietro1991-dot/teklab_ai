## Overview

On January 22nd, Matias continues the Physical Week with one of the most charged topics in modern discourse: Politics. Speaking from the Nile River in Egypt, he offers a teaching that reframes our entire understanding of governance—not as control or power over others, but as the art of sailing through the deep waters of consciousness.

The word government comes from the Greek concept meaning "to sail the ship." In ancient Greece, kings would gather in meetings to decide about their countries by sailing between the islands of the Aegean Sea. They needed to know how to sail to be in touch with one another. In Egypt along the Nile, the pharaohs would sail from temple to temple, showing themselves and testing if they were able to govern themselves—to sail their own boat. Because if they were not able to govern themselves, they would not be able to govern others.

This teaching arrives at a profound time in Matias's journey. He shares vulnerably that after six months of attempting to speak about politics, he finally realized: "The I Am Path is not to speak about politics—right or left, communism or capitalism—or to criticize and teach them. It is to understand if we are able to govern ourselves or not."

Today, politics is seen as something horrible in the world, but Matias insists this is not because of politicians—it's because we forgot we were in a boat. We forgot how to sail. We stopped practicing self-governance, so we handed our ship to others and then blamed them for not steering perfectly.

The real politics is not the battle to gain territory or convince others to live according to our ideas. The real politics is learning to sail our own ship through the ocean of the subconscious, so we can teach others how to navigate their own storms—not by driving their boats for them, but by being a living example of conscious self-governance.

## Core Teaching

### Etymology: Government = To Sail the Ship

Government comes from a Greek word that means "to sail the ship."

Government is to know how you can sail through the deep waters of the subconscious.

The original concept:
- Government = the one who knows how to handle the ship
- The one who knows how to sail in the waters
- Not the one who controls the passengers
- But the one who navigates through the depths

Why sailing?

Because sailing requires:
- Awareness of wind, current, weather
- Reading the waters (conscious and subconscious)
- Adapting to changing conditions
- Knowledge passed through experience
- Teaching others to navigate their own journey

In ancient Greece, kings would meet by sailing between the islands of the Aegean Sea. They had to know how to sail to be in touch with one another, to govern together.

In Egypt along the Nile, the pharaohs would sail from temple to temple, showing themselves to the people, testing if they were able to govern themselves—to sail their own boat.

The test: If they were not able to govern themselves (sail their own ship), they would not be able to govern others.

This is the key: Self-governance comes first.

### The Ocean: Subconscious Waters

The ocean, the river, the waters—these represent the SUBCONSCIOUS.

The subconscious is:
- Everything you don't know about yourself
- The depths beneath conscious awareness
- The currents that move you without your knowing
- The storms that arise from within

To govern is to sail through these deep waters of the subconscious—not to control them, but to navigate them with awareness.

When you sail, you don't control the ocean. You work with it. You read it. You adapt to it.

That's what governance should be: Working with the subconscious currents of the people, not trying to control them.

### Greek Political Terms: Understanding Power

The Greeks had different words for different types of power:

KRATOS = Force, physical power, the ability to impose

ARCHE = Origin, beginning, the power that comes from the source

These two types of power created different political systems:

DEMOCRACY (demos + kratos):
- Rule by the people through force/will
- The majority imposes on the minority
- Power through numbers

OLIGARCHY (oligos + arche):
- Rule by the few from the origin/source
- Power through lineage, divine right, hierarchy
- The few decide for the many

ANARCHY (an + arche):
- Without origin, without imposed structure
- Self-governance, individual sovereignty
- No external authority

The problem: We've been choosing between KRATOS systems (who has the force?) instead of learning to govern ourselves (developing our own arche, our own connection to source).

### The Real Question About Politics

Matias spent six months trying to figure out how to speak about politics without getting caught in the trap of sides—right vs. left, communism vs. capitalism, this party vs. that party.

He finally realized: The I Am Path is not to speak about politics in that way—to criticize systems, to teach people what to think politically.

The I Am Path is to understand: Are we able to govern ourselves or not?

That's the real question.

Can you sail your own ship through the deep waters of your subconscious? Can you navigate your own storms? Can you read the currents within yourself and adapt?

If you cannot govern yourself—if you cannot sail your own ship—how can you participate consciously in governing with others?

### Why Politics Seems Horrible Today

Today, politics is seen as something horrible in the world.

But this is not because of politicians.

This is because we forgot we were in a boat.

We forgot how to sail.

We stopped practicing self-governance.

So we handed our ship to others—to politicians, to systems, to authorities—and then we blamed them when they didn't steer perfectly.

We gave away our power to sail, and then we complained about the direction.

The problem is not "out there" in the political systems. The problem is that we stopped learning to navigate our own waters.

### The True Role of Government

The one who governs properly does NOT drive everyone's boat.

The one who governs properly teaches others how to sail in a storm.

A true leader is someone who:
- Has learned to sail their own ship
- Can navigate through deep waters
- Can teach others to do the same
- Does not impose control
- Does not drive your boat for you
- Shows you how to sail your own journey

This is completely different from what we see today, where:
- Leaders try to control everyone's direction
- People expect leaders to solve their problems
- We've forgotten we each have our own ship to sail

### Coming Back to Self-Governance

The solution is not to fight against the political system "out there."

The solution is to come back to self-governance "in here."

Can you govern yourself?

Can you:
- Navigate your own subconscious waters?
- Read the currents within you?
- Adapt to your own storms?
- Sail through difficulty without losing your way?
- Teach others through your example?

This is the real politics: The art of sailing your own ship through the ocean of consciousness.

When enough people learn to sail their own ships, the whole ocean changes.

## Practice

### Meditation: Sailing Your Own Ship

1. Sit comfortably and close your eyes.

2. Take a deep breath and become aware of your body as a ship—a vessel moving through the waters of life.

3. Visualize yourself standing at the helm of your ship. Feel the wheel in your hands.

4. Notice the waters around you—sometimes calm, sometimes stormy. These are the waters of your subconscious.

5. Ask yourself: Am I sailing this ship, or have I given the wheel to someone else?

6. Notice if you're waiting for someone else to steer, to tell you where to go, to navigate for you.

7. Take the wheel fully. Feel yourself as the one who governs this vessel.

8. The waters may be deep. The currents may be strong. But you know how to sail.

9. You don't control the ocean. You navigate it. You work with it. You adapt.

10. Repeat:
    - "I Am the Conscious Essence."
    - "I govern myself through the deep waters."
    - "I sail my own ship with awareness."

11. Feel yourself navigating—not controlling, but consciously sailing through whatever waters you encounter.

12. When you're ready, take a deep breath and open your eyes, bringing this awareness of self-governance into your day.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Throughout the day, practice conscious self-governance:

1. **Notice when you're waiting for someone else to "govern" you:**
   - Waiting for authorities to tell you what to do
   - Expecting leaders to solve your problems
   - Looking for external validation before acting
   - Giving your power away to systems, people, ideologies

2. **Ask yourself: Am I sailing my own ship?**
   - Am I consciously navigating my choices?
   - Am I adapting to my circumstances with awareness?
   - Am I reading the currents within myself?
   - Or have I handed the wheel to someone else?

3. **Practice navigating, not controlling:**
   - You can't control the ocean (life's circumstances)
   - But you can learn to sail (navigate with consciousness)
   - Work WITH the waters, don't fight them
   - Adapt, adjust, stay aware

4. **Observe your relationship with "politics":**
   - Do you blame external systems for your experience?
   - Do you engage in "kratos" battles (force vs. force)?
   - Can you step back and focus on self-governance first?

5. **Be an example, not a controller:**
   - If you've learned to sail, show others through your example
   - Don't try to drive their boats for them
   - Teach navigation skills, not directions
   - Trust others to find their own way

### Applying This Teaching

- Stop waiting for politicians or systems to fix your life—learn to sail your own ship through conscious self-governance
- Before judging political leaders, ask: Have I learned to govern myself? Can I navigate my own subconscious waters?
- Politics is not about controlling others or being controlled—it's about sailing consciously through the deep waters of life
- The ocean (life, circumstances, collective subconscious) cannot be controlled—but you can learn to navigate it with awareness
- When you govern yourself consciously, you naturally teach others through example, not through force or control

### Physical Week Context

This is the second day of the Physical Week (BODY 'ESSENCE'):

Day 171 - Religion (Crown): Tie back to divine essence  
Day 172 - Politics (Third Eye): Sail through conscious essence

The progression:
- Crown → Connect to source (divine essence)
- Third Eye → Navigate consciously (conscious essence)

Both are systems where spiritual essence manifests in physical structures. Religion ties us back to the source. Politics is how we navigate from that connection.

Tomorrow: Education (Throat)—drawing truth from within through questioning.

## Questions for Reflection

**Q: What does "government" originally mean, and why does this matter?**

Government = Greek "to sail the ship"—the ability to navigate through deep waters. This matters because it completely reframes politics: not as control, force, or power over others, but as conscious navigation through the subconscious. The waters (ocean, river) represent the subconscious—the depths beneath awareness, the currents that move us. True governance is learning to sail through these waters with consciousness, adapting to conditions, working WITH the currents rather than trying to control them. This shifts politics from external battles to internal mastery.

**Q: What was the ancient test of governance in Greece and Egypt?**

In Greece, kings met by sailing between islands of the Aegean Sea—they had to know how to sail to be in touch with one another and govern together. In Egypt, pharaohs would sail from temple to temple along the Nile, testing if they were able to govern themselves—to sail their own boat. The principle: If you cannot govern yourself (sail your own ship), you cannot govern others. Self-governance comes first. This is completely opposite to modern politics where people seek power over others without first mastering themselves.

**Q: What's the difference between KRATOS and ARCHE?**

KRATOS = force, physical power, the ability to impose. ARCHE = origin, beginning, power that comes from the source. These create different political systems: Democracy (demos + kratos) = rule by people through force/majority. Oligarchy (oligos + arche) = rule by few from source/lineage. Anarchy (an + arche) = without imposed structure, self-governance. We've been choosing between KRATOS systems (who has the force to impose?) instead of learning to connect to our own ARCHE (source/origin) and govern ourselves from that connection.

**Q: What is the real question about politics according to Matias?**

The I Am Path is not to speak about politics in terms of right vs. left, communism vs. capitalism, criticizing systems or teaching people what to think politically. The real question is: Are we able to govern ourselves or not? Can you sail your own ship through the deep waters of your subconscious? Can you navigate your own storms? If you cannot govern yourself—if you cannot sail your own ship—how can you participate consciously in governing with others? Self-governance is the foundation.

**Q: Why does politics seem horrible today?**

Not because of politicians. It's because we forgot we were in a boat. We forgot how to sail. We stopped practicing self-governance. So we handed our ship to others—to politicians, systems, authorities—and then we blamed them when they didn't steer perfectly. We gave away our power to navigate, and then we complained about the direction. The problem is not "out there" in political systems—the problem is that we stopped learning to sail our own ships through our own waters.

**Q: What is the true role of government/leadership?**

The one who governs properly does NOT drive everyone's boat. The one who governs properly teaches others how to sail in a storm. A true leader: has learned to sail their own ship, can navigate through deep waters, can teach others to do the same, does not impose control, does not drive your boat for you, shows you how to sail your own journey. This is completely different from modern leadership where leaders try to control everyone's direction and people expect leaders to solve their problems. We've forgotten we each have our own ship to sail.

**Q: What is the solution to political problems?**

The solution is not to fight against the political system "out there." The solution is to come back to self-governance "in here." Can you govern yourself? Can you navigate your own subconscious waters, read the currents within you, adapt to your own storms, sail through difficulty without losing your way, teach others through your example? This is the real politics: the art of sailing your own ship through the ocean of consciousness. When enough people learn to sail their own ships, the whole ocean changes.
