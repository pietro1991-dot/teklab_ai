## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

So something that I never had a story that I do n't look straight to the camera because actually if I see the camera again bored because it 's just the camera.

So I looked at the chat that while I also like to see the chat , to see where people behind the screen and I 'm not speaking to myself alone and boring. I will be very , very tired.

So I 'm sleepy , very sleepy.

So if I 'm young , sorry , if would you get when you are doing these transmissions in a hour that you are supposed to be watching a movie.

So let 's go to the topic for today which is security. Let 's go to the meaning of the word , the etymology of it so we can understand what we are talking about.

So the origin of the word is , well , let 's go to the word security. Security comes from the word , say which means to separate to take something apart from other things and curate that means to preoccupate.

Something when we say preoccupate , the word means to set yourself in place of something way before it happened. Pre , that means before and occupy the meaning to be on a place.

So preoccupate is basically to be a place before the things happen.

So when you say security in and of this old word which in Latin is secuitas , all together means that you do n't need to have preoccupation. You do n't have to preoccupate of anything because I 'm a part of all things or all problems.

So the problems are a way. I am a part of them.

So I should n't preoccupate.

So the word security means that I am safe that I do n't have anything to be occupied.

So we have two point of views to understand security. One from the point of view of the inside , the individual and the other one from the view society from the outside.

So we have to see from where it comes the idea of security in order to understand it too.

So let 's go into that.

So in the same way we have a whole eternity that is vibration and energy and matter , we also have another Trinity which is based on the needs. They remember which are those , the three needs that every being needs. Perfect. They are to eat , to sleep and security.

This is the Trinity of means. Let 's remember how this Trinity of needs work.

Sorry I did a mistake. I 'm sleepy. The third one is to reproduce.

Sorry.

Sorry it is each sleep and reproduce. The three bases of the need. Let 's go to explain now how this circuit works.

So understand the eating.

Remember that the eating is very important for this needs. Because it is one of the bases of the universe. It is one of the main ways of reality.

So remember this. We have been speaking about energy and exchange. We have been learning how the waves have different frequencies that express in positive and negative.

So these positive and negative are an exchange of constant energy , electrical pulses that then when they become particles they share as positive and negative.

So they share energy from one particle to another.

So this is the first exchange of energy in the universe. Then it starts to expand and grow.

So they multiply and they start to create much more complex structures that keep point and growing and get much more specifics into their accumulation of energy. This means that all the structures of atoms that starts to grow and create much more bigger sources of energy , they also made that the ones that were consuming that energy , they too evolve into different structures , for organisms that will consume that other energy. And that 's what we call to eat , to tourism , to feed. The idea is that what we are doing , eating something and then the jet , the jet thing that something is exactly the same that electrons and protons are doing in energy , but we are doing it in a much more complex way.

And this means that eating is one of the needs of our entire universe. The creation itself of the universe is based on the exchange of energy.

So that 's why eating is important. And it does n't matter the shape of that exchange , because some people can just breathing , delight , song gazing. You can do whatever you want and as much as you can or it 's in your hands , but the base is that you are changing energy.

So after we eat , after we have exchanged this energy , suddenly the positive and the negative to be in balance.

So they get both of them , have the same weight , the same charge.

So they are stabilized for a moment. And that moment of stabilization is what we call in a human perspective to sleep. The process sleeping is the moment in which we can restore the link energy , because now we have everything within. But we have everything already inside when we have the energy that we need.

Our body starts to stand still in order to work with that energy to create a new structure transcendental from one and before.

So that 's why it 's so important for the universe also to sleep , because it 's the moment in which everything that you have done process.

So the first step is the reproduction. Why reproduction?

Remember that we have set reproduction comes once you have processed all the information that you have from what you ate , your cells process that information during the process of sleeping. And then you have to take it out. You have to proceed to take that thing from the inside again to the outside. And that 's why we call reproduction.

The reproduction means that everything that we have processed within is now being able to be manifest outside.

So it 's not necessarily related to the sex , to having kids. But biology have the same way through sexuality that helps to keep the body in the right way.

So keep the circle going on.

So that 's why the cells designed the idea of multiplication and transcendence of the body.

Now think deep , all the torus people here. One really feels torus people. And this three needs the holy sacred Trinity of torus.

So we can understand here , this is the typical image that we all have from torus. Tours is like the idea of someone that is eating all the time or thinking about eating all the time. And someone that needs to sleep much more than anyone else. And it 's really difficult to take them out from the bed.

And constantly is in the need of carries , love and the sexuality.

So the sacred Trinity of the needs is basically the sacred Trinity of torus.

So you can relate with that. When we have this holy Trinity of torus , we can understand that there is something missing. That makes this possible , the Trinity possible , which is security to feel safe. This is something that is really important for torus to the energy of torus.

The energy of torus is basically someone that needs to feel safe , that needs secure boundaries. It needs to feel protected. Then it 's of a house where it can have the food to eat , where it can be ensured of able to sleep , dream and , of course , you have a place to reproduce safety.

So here we have two kinds of security. One is the one in the from the outside. It 's the security that we need in order to be able to eat , to sleep and to reproduce , which are physical things aspect. And in the other hand , we have the inner one that we call safety.

And in this we have two words for this. The inner aspect is safety , which is the idea of feeling safe of yourself , feeling secure of yourself. Why do you need to eat , sleep and reproduce? It 's security.

The word that I 'm trying to say is security. Not safe. Why security is so important?

Remember here that the living beings we have been designed in order to try to catch as much as information as we can from our mind.

So we are participating , every change and everything that could happen around us all the time. Because of this , our nervous system are trying to , to understand what is happening , because maybe something can kill me in the outside.

So the brain is in a constant state of alarm. It 's all a thinking in danger.

Something can happen.

So this state of alarm is the one that keeps us alive and understanding the environment around. There are three moments where we do not have much this state of alarm , because the brain is concentrated in other things. When we eat , the brain is only concentrated in what we have to do.

So we have to ensure that are going to be safe during this process of eating. That 's why we need security as security to not that we are able to eat. Then of course , then once we eat , we need to rest. Why?

Because the brain stops looking outside and starts to work entirely from within. It starts to set all its intention and energy. It pain attention to specifically the digestive system , the striker system and circulatory system. It tries to understand out to this tribute , this new energy within in every one of the organs.

So that 's why we need to rest to sleep. We need to do that in order to , for the brain to know what to do in that moment.

So no state of alarm during that moment. And of course , when we reproduce , is a very vulnerable situation where are exposed , because you are wasting a lot of energy , animals , or whoever , or people are wasting a lot of energy. And the brain is only thinking about what the body is doing and what is feeling.

So it 's not concerned in nothing else. Why the brain needs to feel safe in that situation. That 's why we need security in order to reproduce. In this of security , in order to eat , sleep and reproduce , every living being in nature have been designed in order to be able to feel safe when they do this three things.

And every animal , every plant , we have been designed in order to be constantly in a stage of alarm.

So the entire energy has been disposed into that intention to see if anything can kill us all the time. Every second , the animals are looking , wasting which they can die and wasting which they can feel secure in order to eat , sleep and reproduce. And eventually humans appear , home in it , creating the humanity. And humans start to decide an outer tool to ensure as a Warren that we can eat , sleep and reproduce , not thinking of any preparation , any problem.

So outer tool that humans create is what we call society.

Society is the creation of humanity in order to ensure security.

So everyone can feel safe.

## Q&A

So it divides the groups in those who are going to be in charge of eating in those who are going to be in charge of taking care of the weak. Those who are going to be in charge of production. Each one society will have a different task that takes care of all topics of the group in order to ensure security.

So what we start to do in the society is to give the responsibility of this security to the different bodies of the society. Like the security of the food to the farmers , the security of the production , to the producers , the security of the government , the leadership , the community of the entire population , which is the military.

So each one has its own responsibility being a warrant of something of a security.

So the entire society can feel safe.

So as much grows the society and many more individuals exist , the system has to change because the people is every day farther from those for those who has the responsibility each one of the topics.

So we need another system that helps to keep security working on. And that 's what we call bureaucracy. Boreocracy comes from the French word , the means desk.

So the power of the desk , of those who work with the papers and so on.

So in this way to organize the society in order to keep the system going with a lot of people.

So the reason why we have bureaucracy is not because something that happened in humanity. This bureaucracy was really good at the time that was needed. We have to , when you start to see the history , how it works , you will understand that every system was useful for a specific time. The problem is when we still use them and the time has changed.

That 's the main problem.

So what really happened with the bureaucracy is that it was the best way to administrated so much people. There were so many people , so much population around. That bureaucracy was one of the answers to administrated so many people.

So it was really good. It was nice at the moment.

Now it does n't work because today we need someone in a desk solving the problems because we all have phones , we all have internet computers , we are able to communicate without a need of a hierarchy. That 's why for us today is like , why this works like this? Because it 's the system that we knew , but it 's ending so that 's why it 's horrible. It 's not horrible.

It 's simply that it 's another time , another environment context.

So what is the real meaning of security here? Security is not to feel safe here. Security is a warring. Security is that assure you that you will be able to eat , to sleep and to reproduce.

Is like someone comes with a paper and says , I 'm here and I say to you that I guarantee you that you will be able to eat every day because you will have the market. I guarantee you that you will be able to sleep because we take care of the problems. We guarantee you that you will be a reproduced and produced whatever you want because you are regarding to you that you will be safe and you will be able to do all this.

So now what happened? That in order to have that security , you need to know a lot of people are sure that that will happen.

So here is when bureaucracy comes in , bureaucracy comes in the moment when you need a lot of people to ensure to assure that security. For example , you need someone to make the paper , another one to write it , another word to sign it , another one to put a stamp on it. Every of those persons need to leave , they are working.

So we have so many people doing each part of system that goes from one desk to another , bureaucracy and you need to maintain all those people and that 's why you have access. You have to maintain all these people that work to ensure your security for you to be saved. And if you think it is logic , of course it 's very logic that system.

So now the problem comes to problem here in bureaucracy. The that person that came to you at first time and told you , I guarantee you that you will have to eat , you will have to sleep , you will have to produce and I guarantee you that I save all the system that I will take care of all this. Then when you sign that the person now can decide for you what to eat , what is good for you to eat , where to sleep and how long is good for you to sleep and where to produce and what is good to produce.

So when you suddenly say no but I am I do n't agree with what you are , I do n't want to do this in this way , I want to do something different. That same person that you signed the paper to can tell you , oh you are a man who is to our security , you are putting our security in jeopardy.

So that person can take the forces of security to take you back like if you are the virus of the system. The same system that you have created. When we speak usually about military and police , we usually make the same mistake as when we speak about money. When we speak about money , we used to say that if we would n't have money this would be better.

This would be better. And it 's not because the problem is not the money , it 's not the matter , it 's the concept that we have on the value of money. The same thing happens with the military and the police. We have a bad concept of the military and the police because they were created to be used by a government and a system and a new system.

It 's not the problem is not that there are police and military. They are useful , they exist for something , they are needed for something. The problem is who are using them and for which purpose? The forces of security can not be government ever because they were made for another thing.

All the philosophies come from the idea of military leaders. They do n't evolve. In order to evolve , we have to be open to new things. The military where it 's not a steward , the things that exist to protect what there is.

This is why whenever something different , they interpret it as a virus that needs to be killed. This is why every idea of the military will end up in a kind of dictatorship. There are not useful for that. It 's not the goal.

I repeat , this does n't mean that they do n't have to exist. It means that they are not yet doing or accomplishing the work that they were supposed to do. Why we reached this point? Because power and tire history , we have been given our power to others.

For them side , upon our three main needs. The goal in order to change this concept of the security we have today is to have security of our own selves. To be secure with them , it means to be in the access to accept who you are. To know that you have the inner power to decide what to eat , how much this leap and what to produce.

That is to be secure of yourself.

So acknowledge yourself and to empower yourself. In order to be secure and to be in that access , we do n't need to fight anyone or to go against any system. The only thing that we have to do is to refer to ourselves to be secure of ourselves. To know that within you you have the power to manifest and act.

## Daily Practice Elements

To take action by yourself in order to do what you are supposed to do , in fact , made it , make it , trusting your inner self. The vibration for today is wall. The statement for today is a range of every pattern. Virus.

Among all possible living organisms that exist on earth , the virus is the only one that is closer to a zombie. It 's that being that behaves like a living one. Carrying genes , NA or NA and multiplying after invading a living body for which it 's able to sublist and expand. Virus are seen as bad and as a disease carrier.

However , for biology they 've been elemental basis that promote the evolution of species. Casting their adaptation and the activation of potential. Let 's go to alignment. Sit comfortable close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing.

I become aware of the space that surrounds me in the body that I inhabit. I am my own breathing. I use my imagination to turn this space around an infinite dark void. I perceive myself , levitating in the center of this huge void.

Softly slowly. I start to cares the space around stretching the body. Moving as if it is a dance. I try to lay back.

We slowly , I can bat fit the position , tagging my legs and if I ca n't just hug your own body or take your hands In this book I recognize myself as a seed , the seed of the tribe The universe is seed A universe that I can recognize that within me I have the entire potential to become another tree I universe of my own I can see this very affluent turning into a beak drop of water Start to fall down to my body And drop of water in light I can perceive this drop of water Falling down into my head Going through my palms And inter quest my heart Plexus , the Scrum , and reaching the Ruchaka where it is absorbed. I can feel how it then is activated , the source that makes me a rebound within entire universe , activating the energy of my being in abundance , giving me strength.

## Energy Work

So I can manifest the matter where I can feel secure of myself , with my hands I take this energy , this energy that makes me feel secure of myself and expand it with my hands up , becoming the leaves of this seed as the feet becomes the roots. I expand the security of myself and my arms going up in the roots of my legs going down to the ground , my arms becoming the branches , my finger and the leaves and flowers , expanding the security of myself. I become a big tree , secure of itself. I recognize that this security has been created with all the patterns that I inherit throughout the history and I use all of them now to build up my axis , my inner power.

I am the origin of all patterns. I am the origin of all patterns. I have security in myself , I have my hands. I take a deep breath and each one and it 's time to come back here and now.

## Q&A

And those who are following the task for this month put this energy in the water and put it on the seeds that we have sold.
