## Introduction

Hi everyone , good afternoon , good afternoon , good afternoon. I 'm still trying to gain back my voice and just trying to be fine , but I 'm still seeing you can see very low , but getting that.

So yesterday , yesterday I had like , catharsis and my physical body could n't stand what I was going through with them and I started to have. I decided that being so many days in bed was not good , so I decided to go out to go around to do something different and maybe it was too fast. Because I faint and I had to do , to put all my strength to arrive back here.

So when I came back , I faint in my bed.

So it was all my body collapsing by all the things that I was feeling , so it 's like stress. It happens to me many times before , but it 's been more than a year or even more than without happening.

## Guided Meditation

So today , even though I do n't have much voice and it 's difficult to breathe properly , but today I had much more energy to start doing things , working. My body is tired , so much inner work.

So as I said , this month was about being like this and I did n't expect it to be so like that. But even though I see you have seen it 's very important for us to take a little kid to the subconscious in this way , feeling. Because even if the things that we feel in the subconscious are not created with our philosophy of life , with our way of thinking , they 're part of us , so we have to act what is inside of us. And usually all these bad feelings and fears and these low emotions that we have in the subconscious are like the sediments , the sense of the fundamentals for what we are today.

We usually believe that in the subconscious , we have all these bad things that this pains and horrible memories that when we start to become conscious and try to heal those memories , we usually believe that all of that goes , that we are cleaning all those things from ourselves , so we can keep going , but the truth is that it 's not. It does n't matter how much we heal , the sessions will always have what happened. We always take that information , those emotions , everything within us is constantly there.

So the only thing that we can do about it is that in our process of awareness , we recognize and accept all this out of us and try to use it in the right way every time that they appear. In my own life , my fear to humans , my disgust for humans , has been the clue for me to be willing to become a human , to help humanity and also start to human. To enjoy being one.

So basically all these low emotions that were inside of me are like the engine , the fuel that pushed me to the constant sick of ways in which we can have as a species as an individual.

So usually we use to cover this feeling , this sensations because somehow we are like when we start to work with love and peace and evolution awareness. We start to kind of hide all these emotions because we do n't want to show what we feel inside and we cover that. Because we are like mammals we were designed to try to be able to survive and so it 's really difficult for us to really say what we feel. Ethics and morals used to create like a line of thoughts that tells us all the time.

You should feel like this or you should do like that in order to be something. Like they are trying to tell you how to behave in order to be who you are supposed to be. And this things makes us not share what we really feel. What are the real emotions that we have inside trying to show something that we are not.

So I must thank all of you. Those who are following every day. These videos because I can tell I can feel that all of you can understand that this is a process that. We all go through these kind of things and besides I am here explaining.

Giving like this kind of classes and so on I am also like anyone of you going through processes having emotions and trauma and all these kind of things.

So I really appreciate this order of all of you understanding this process.

So as I as I wrote today in the blog. I really think that I could see how after all this month in the last moment of the path. I allow myself to fall down to show all my weakness and conflicts. I could see how everyone of you has been holding me and holding everyone with comments with advice.

So I could really see how we are holding each other. Even if we do n't know each other.

So one of the things that I also could say about this this process that we are living is how is important to see that in this time of Aquarium. It 's not a time to follow for enlightened beings that can save or be the perfect beings. Then in this era we are all working together and each one has something to give to the others.

So each one makes it 's part and I am doing my part. But even though we are all doing a process and we all share this process.

So I guess this month of Aquarium is this month of cancer is like trying to show us that there is no one above that we are all related to family. Everyone doing what you can.

So I really hope that this day of my own process has been also helpful or useful for you somehow in your own process. In your life. Mostly because I hope it would encourage you to to be able to share what you feel to be able to face the things that are inside. Usually it 's not shared.

Also things that we have in the subconscious.

So once one thing that I want to say about the subconscious about the subconscious , even if we have today 's more ahead of it. Is that subconscious does not define consciousness. And the right example to understand this is like. For example you can not define a country today by its history.

Like in that every country is a person. Whatever it had whatever happened in that country in history , it does n't mean that countries like that today. For example the greatest example of all is Germany. You can not judge the actual Germany for the things that Germany have done in the first second third right.

In in its history. But it 's important to know its history is important to deep and to recognize what is behind the history. But it does define the actual person. And if we have to know the history.

And this is to have a country. To have a person. As I said , it 's. When we are trying to.

When we become aware of our own life. Of our history is how we started to know our past from where we come from and the past does n't define us.

So when we. And flower ourselves to feel what is within us own our emotions , our history , our. Our things that we usually hide. And we allowed to feel them to recognize them.

We are like , the acknowledging of our own history. What happened? You can only acknowledge what happened. Recognize it and accept it.

So when we go into the subconscious , it 's like that. We can not judge what happened in the past , which is , can I acknowledge it and accept what is inside? And , when we do that , we can not change the past. The only thing we can do is to accept it so we can heal the future.

So the things that we can acknowledge from the past are things to recognize the present , accepted in the present and heal the future. But we can change the past , we can only accept it. This is why I encourage you to accept what is within you and your past and your subconscious to allow yourself to feel it , to recognize it.

So the topic for today was the C. And the C is like , as I wrote in the post today is like , this environment where all the sharp things , all the things that we are grabbing through through the river that we grew with us , all the burden that we hold with us is brought into the C and through millions of years , it starts to be a road. And the waves on the shore start to polish that until it 's soft , until it 's a grain of sand.

So this process is not for one life , this process is not just for only one run of the river. This is for thousands of years , a long process in which we carry many things to the C , the C takes millions of years until they move the rocks and to soft environment. Turning the sharp things into brown and soft things turning hate into love.

So through the C , all the things that we were grabbing , taking with us throughout the idea of a purpose on the land turns out to be free , expanded in the C.

So it 's inevitable to feel like this to keep feeling sometimes going down , grabbing things , feeling like this. But that 's not the why we do. Every river ends in the C.

So important thing to know about this is that this would be a constant cycle all the time. It will be like this. But it will also change all the time.

So it 's a constant cycle in which we will be transforming ourselves into evolution.

So when we recognize this in our life , we can move forward. Knowing that this process is about taking things for myself , for my evolution , and then letting all the things go out. That process of letting go out is what we call catharsis , cleaning up ourselves. And catharsis is basically the moment that shows us that we were not leaving behind and we were n't letting go in the process of transformation.

So I have two advice in general that I will tell them to myself too.

So on one side , tell you to allow yourself to express to say what you have inside to share the things that are within you. And for some people maybe , it will take a process of one day and for others a process of a year.

So we have to respect the time that we need to do that , but we have to. And in the other hand , the advice I will say is stop judging , stop judging the process of others. No one can really understand the process that other people are leaving. No one can really be exactly in the feet of others.

## Q&A

So we have to be open to accept the process of others and being there as a support if they ask if they need and not judging in if you are doing it right or if you are doing it wrong. Or how it is supposed to be or how you supposed to be and feel. Judging others during the process is basically showing us what kind of people and what kind of level and evolution of consciousness we are. They used to say love one another.

## Daily Practice Elements

And the final thing is that most of the people they usually follow the master and just do n't really apply what he said. And they allow myself this moment of judgment because I do n't consider myself enlightened. The vibration today is all. The statement today is I am a dreamer of possibilities.
