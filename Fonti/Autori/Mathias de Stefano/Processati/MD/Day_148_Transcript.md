## Overview

On December 29th, we explore the knees of the planet Earth—two regions that represent flexibility, history, and ancestry: the Middle East and Central America. Matias reminds us that there is no one place on Earth that only means one region of the body. The distribution is very different because we are constructed in layers.

Some places on Earth represent two, three, or even four regions of the body. This is because the Earth has different layers—one layer over another. So sometimes the same region represents different things depending on whether we're speaking of the inner part or the outer part.

The knees represent flexibility in our path, the history of our own life, and the ancestors—everyone that made it possible for us to be here: mom and dad, grandparents, and so on. We hold that information in the knee region of our body.

## Core Teaching

### Finding the Knees on Earth's Body

In order to understand where the knees are, imagine positioning yourself as the Earth. Sit as if you are the Earth's body.

In this position:
- The heart is Europe
- The two lungs are the Amazon and the Congo (a little bit lower than the heart)
- Africa and Europe form the upper body
- The chin is Central America

In this position of Earth, the knees show us that these two joints are the Middle East and Central America.

### The Knees Represent Flexibility and History

The knees represent the flexibility, the history, the flexibility that we have in our path. They represent the history of our own life.

The knees also represent the ancestors and everyone that made it possible for us to be here—mom and dad, the grandparents, and so on. All this history of our ancestors is related to the knees. We hold that information in that region of our body.

For the world, this information of mom and dad is related to the Middle East and Central America:
- **Middle East = Mother**
- **Central America = Father**

### Formation of the Two Knees

To understand the tectonic plates of Central America and the Middle East, we have to know that they are not the main tectonic plates. They are smaller plates, even made up with different smaller ones. They work because of the pressure of all the other continents around.

**The two small tectonic plates:**
1. **Central America** is created by fire, by volcanoes. All these volcanoes start to create this tectonic plateau in the center.
2. **Middle East** is created by different islands that are put all together by the pressure of Africa and Laurasia (an ancient continent), and all the continents of Asia and Europe. They press toward each other.

All these islands were in the sea of Tethys. Tethys doesn't exist anymore. So one knee is created by fire, the other is created by the pressure of land.

### The Caribbean Plate (Central America)

Talking about Central America, the plateau of Central America is not called the Central American plateau or plate. It's called the **Caribbean Plate**.

The Caribbean Plate starts in the south of Mexico and makes the mountains of Chiapas rise up. From Chiapas, it goes to the Caribbean Sea to the south coast of Cuba.

In front of Cuba, of course, we find Puerto Rico and Jamaica. Then it goes to the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). It goes to Puerto Rico and from there all the islands of the Antilles, touching the northern coast of Venezuela.

It gets inside Colombia and goes to the western mountains of the Andes in Colombia. Coming up again through the coast of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

All this territory—the Caribbean Plate—is what we also call the **mouth of the planet.**

### The Mouth of the Planet

Imagine that every country in Central America, every volcano in Central America, and every island in the Antilles represents every tooth.

All the teeth of the planet. Imagine, for example, that one of the main teeth—this one is Cuba, and the other one aside is Hispaniola (Santo Domingo). These two represent the main teeth.

The Caribbean Plate is moving against the movement of the other two Americas. South America and North America are moving toward the Pacific Ocean, getting away from Africa. But the Caribbean Plate goes straight toward Africa.

It got into the middle of the two big continents and opened a path, raising up the Antilles.

### Central America: The Wise Father

Central America represents the **wise father**—the father that came from the skies and brought information from the heavens.

Why is that? Because Central America, as we have spoken before, represents (with part of North America) the great father, Mexico. The wise man that brings information from the skies toward the earth.

And how does it do this? By sharing the wisdom, sharing information. That's the mouth. The Caribbean is the mouth of this wise energy and is brought by:
- The ideas of South America (the third eye)
- The voice to create and manifest of North America (the throat)

So in between the mind/spirit of South America and the throat/voice of North America, we have the mouth—Central America.

### Seeking the Mother

Geographically, imagine this: in between the mind of the spirit in South America and the throat (the potential of the voice) in North America, Central America (the Caribbean Plate) is looking for Africa.

The information of the heavens that the father from the sky carries—that information is coming to seek the mother. In order to bring this information to be manifested, to become life here.

Somehow, what we can say is that the father is willing to come to the earth to manifest itself because it's in love with the mother. He wants to come here to have life, to have kids with this mother, with Earth.

### The Love to Mother Earth

Now you will see that all the American native people are related with the love to Earth. This is not because they represent the mother—it's because **they represent the father that is in love with the mother.**

That's why all the wise people from the Americas that came into Central America downloaded information of the father, and they started to spread it into North America and South America. They connected the whole population in this love to Mother Earth, to the Pachamama, to connect with giving everything to the earth, to be connected constantly with the earth.

It's totally opposite of what we could think. We might think they were related with the mother, but no—they are the wisdom of the father. And that is why they connect with the body of the mother. They are in love with Mother Earth.

### The Middle East Plate (The Mother)

Now let's go to the other knee and how it begins. Remember this: on the other side of the world, Africa was going up toward the northeast, and Laurasia was coming southwest.

Both of them started to press toward each other, and in the middle there was the ocean of Tethys. Remember that the ocean of Tethys disappeared already. (Remember about India creating the Himalayas when it pressed the Tethys ocean.)

Now it's happening again. Africa is pushing up, and Laurasia is pushing down. All the islands that were in the middle between these two continents around the region of the Tethys ocean got all together, creating different layers of mountains that created the Middle East Plate.

### The Geography of the Middle East

The region of the Middle East—the territories that incorporate this plate—include:

- **Anatolia** (the peninsula we call today Turkey)
- All the **Aegean islands**
- The **peninsula of the Peloponnese** in Greece
- All the region of the Aegean Sea
- **Crete Island**
- **Cyprus**
- By the north, the **Caucasus Mountains** that separate Russia from Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan
- The whole region of **Iran**
- Part of **Pakistan**
- The whole **Arabian Peninsula**, incorporating the countries of:
  - Oman
  - Yemen
  - Saudi Arabia
  - United Arab Emirates
  - Qatar
  - Bahrain
  - Kuwait
  - Iraq
  - Jordan
- The **Sinai Peninsula** in Egypt
- **Israel**
- **Palestine**
- **Lebanon**
- **Syria**

All these countries and territories represent the Middle East. This is a territory that is not part of Asia, not part of Europe, not part of Africa. These territories are all from the Middle East Plate.

### The Garden of Eden

This territory is very important from the very beginning for us because it represents the place of the creation of humans as we know them today.

Humans were, of course, created in Africa, but they started to migrate to Asia and Europe through the Middle East. And in the Middle East is where they started to discover how to sow, how to create their own food, how to become sedentary.

That's why they call it the **Garden of Eden**—because everyone was able to create for themselves. They learned agriculture, sedentary living, and the foundations of civilization.

### Mom and Dad Working Together

The two knees—the Middle East (mother) and Central America (father)—work together to give us flexibility in our path.

The mother (Middle East) is the pressure of land, the convergence, the place where everything comes together. She is the garden where life is nurtured and grown.

The father (Central America) is the fire, the volcanoes, the passion and wisdom from the skies. He seeks the mother to manifest his celestial knowledge on Earth.

Together, they represent our ancestry, our history, our ability to move forward with flexibility. Without honoring both mother and father, both knees, we cannot walk the celestial path.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Reflect on your ancestors today. Who are the mother and father energies in your life? Who are the people—both literally and metaphorically—who made it possible for you to be here? Honor them. Thank them. Recognize that your ability to walk forward comes from the foundation they provided.

### Applying This Teaching

Notice the flexibility in your knees—literally and metaphorically. Are you rigid in your path, or can you bend and adapt? The knees give us the ability to walk, to climb, to kneel, to change direction. Reflect on whether you honor both the mother energy (nurturing, bringing together) and the father energy (bringing wisdom from above) in your life.

## Q&A

### Q: Why are there two knees instead of one region for this chakra?

The knees work in pairs—you need both to walk. Similarly, you need both mother and father, both Middle East and Central America, to walk the celestial path. One is formed by pressure (mother), the other by fire (father). Together, they give us the flexibility and history we need to move forward.

### Q: How can the Caribbean be "the mouth of the planet"?

The Caribbean Plate, with all its islands and volcanoes, looks like teeth. Each island—Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, the Antilles—is like a tooth in the mouth. This mouth speaks the wisdom brought from the heavens (South America's third eye and North America's throat) and seeks to connect with the mother (Africa).

### Q: Why is the Middle East called the Garden of Eden?

In the Middle East, humans transitioned from nomadic hunting and gathering to sedentary agriculture. They learned to sow, to create their own food, to settle down. This is where civilization as we know it began. It was a "garden" because humans could create abundance for themselves—they didn't need to wander to survive.

### Q: What does it mean that Central America is "in love with the mother"?

The Caribbean Plate is moving toward Africa (the mother continent) while North and South America move away toward the Pacific. This shows that Central America is seeking the mother. The native peoples of the Americas express this love through their devotion to Pachamama (Mother Earth). They are the father energy seeking to unite with and honor the mother.

### Q: How were the Middle East and Central America formed differently?

Central America was formed by fire—volcanoes creating land through eruption and heat. The Middle East was formed by pressure—the continents of Africa and Laurasia squeezing the islands of the Tethys Sea together until they became mountains and plateaus. Fire vs. pressure. Father vs. mother.

### Q: What does "I Am the Celestial Path" mean?

You are not just walking a path—you ARE the path. Your life, your ancestors, your history, your flexibility—all of this creates the celestial path. You embody the journey. You are the connection between heaven and earth, between the wisdom of the father and the nurturing of the mother.

### Q: How do I honor my ancestors through my knees?

Your knees hold the memory of everyone who walked before you. Every step you take is possible because of them. By recognizing your ancestry—both genetic and spiritual—you honor the foundation they provided. By maintaining flexibility (both physical and mental), you honor their sacrifices and their wisdom.

### Q: Why is it important that some places represent multiple body parts?

Earth is layered, just like we are. We have skin, muscle, bone, organs—all in the same location but serving different functions. Similarly, Earth has different energetic and geological layers. One place can represent different things depending on which layer we're examining. This teaches us to see complexity and multiple truths existing simultaneously.
