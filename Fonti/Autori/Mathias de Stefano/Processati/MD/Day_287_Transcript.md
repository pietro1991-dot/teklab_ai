## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

So let 's begin with our topic for today , which is one of the beauty arts called Dance. And Chosen Case , I literally know I 'm not going to dance. This is not one of the arts in which I can develop myself and it 's not one of my best ones , of course , whoever had read the blog , you might know why.

So let 's talk about the topic which is related , of course , that we will see it from the point of view related to the expansion of the universe. The origin of dancing , the word dance comes from the Germanic languages that means to move movement from one side to another.

So basically is all about movement. And by this movement , I mean any movement in the universe. The movement in the universe , remember , emerges from the vibration. The vibration starts to push a rhythm in the universe that creates a harmony.

And this harmony gives place to shapes.

So those shapes are moving through a constant of rhythm in time and space.

So basically for the universe , the concept of dancing would be , the concept of dancing would be the constant of men and read them through time and space. This is a look from the universal point of view of what is dance.

So everything in the universe is movement born by this frequency that starts to push the waves of vibration into different frequencies. And this different frequency starts to shape different structures in the universe that keep moving , that keep changing ones again and taking different forms different shapes by themselves. But all of them , even though still moving around.

So this movement , for example , this movement , for example , is the one that we see in the atoms , with the particles of the atoms that we see in the galaxies , when they spin the planets , spin in itself in the axis , moving around the stars like hours in the sun.

So the precision of economics is , everything is like a constant movement in entire universe. Everything is moving , it 's moving.

So kind of like the entire universe is dancing. And of course that if the universe is movement , this means that life is a dance. Let 's see into how humans took this idea of movement and transform it into the dances that we have today.

So basically everything begins through this constant movement that nature itself has.

So we can see that all the movements on earth are because the sun is moving the earth. The earth spins in its axis and moves the atmosphere , moves the oceans and the oceans , they are currents. And the air has its currents , positive and negative form and cold. That creates the wind , the wind start to move the trees and the trees seem to dance.

The birds also dance in the sky. The insects , the animals on the earth , everything starts to move. And this is like kind of a pushing process that the main atoms that created everything , they started to expand the energy , they started to move the other atom screens in a reaction that is a constant movement.

So let 's go into that image.

So remember that everything comes from one thing that divides into.

So is this one divides into and multiplied in the others.

So one that has divided itself , now we have two. One will be with positive energy , the one with negative energy.

So this two will try to find the balance and attract each other. But with that actually trying to connect each other again , they will divide themselves into other two.

So we will have now two. What happened with this constant division that start to have all these branches is that the only and first reality that expands outside because of the amount of energy starts to push forward the energy into different directions. Because it wants to get together again , but they created energy , so much energy that they started to expand everything into the cosmos.

So what they are trying to do is to connect themselves by expanding themselves.

So the thing that happens here is that every time that one of these nodes divides itself to create an energy , it will pushing the others by movement and this other ones will try to find a way to find stability.

So to find a new order to restore the order in these connections.

So in a straight line , we can see it in this way.

So take this image here. The image would be that we have these three dots connected by a line. And this three are balanced. But suddenly one of them decides to split it divides because it has too much energy.

So it divides itself. Ah , generating a wave of energy that starts to rise like tsunami until reaching this one. And when it reaches this one , it pushes this one forward creating a huge amount of energy that goes higher and higher when it reaches this one. And so on it keeps like tsunami.

The movement is constant. And that 's what gives us the concept of entropy. The feeling of entropy is the concept of entropy is the idea that a constant movement is constantly taking us towards chaos. But what happened here?

That there are many other lines , not only one , because this is a network. The constant network.

So actually when you see that there is a network , not only one line but a network with many things. We can understand that when this one here starts to violate in a vibration that goes at this harmony. The other ones around , the other ones in the network will try to keep the balance of this one , taking this one back to the original one , trying to put order on it. And that 's what we call sinterpy.

Sinterpy would be the concept that everything goes to an order. Actually , both of them happens constantly all the time.

So in the same time as through entropy , the universe moves towards a chaos , because of that vibration changing all the time. This vibration , this movement , creates many other connections at constant network that tries to bring stability through sinterpy to the universe.

So what this means , that everything in the universe , every movement in the universe is trying to find a shape , a pattern in order to find order with a goal basically of saving energy.

So as an example of this entropy that creates entropy , we are here , life , a human being , for example. We are the entropy , the entropy result of the chaos , of the chemical components. If you want to find the perfect balance of a chemical component , you have to go to the very origin of the universe where only that exist was chopped chemical. That 's it.

So this chemical that you find in the stars , in the rocks , in the planets , those are the basement that are really the truth , the order. But when they start to expand and get chaotic , they create links that manifest life.

So we are basically the entropy of the chemical components. We are chaos for the universe. And even though our bodies work perfectly in order , in such an order that not even today , we can understand exactly how a cell from the brain can communicate with a cell of the feet. And they were perfectly , how they share this information , how they can be in perfect homeostasis.

And all the systems of the body works like a perfect machine that we have no idea exactly how life is possible.

Okay , so that gives you the idea that this entropy is creating entropy somehow.

So every chaos is looking for order. Naturally , when you start to get nip works , it finds order.

So if we see it in that way , it does n't have in logic. But when we look at this other way , now , it will have. A perfect network.

So it 's much more difficult to see the network like this. We look at it as chaotic.

So when we take a look into that in this way , you see also the same thing.

So what we have here is that one idea projects into another idea that projects into another idea that rub the whole system and the whole system projects a new idea that we call now this had tetrahedron.

So here we have the tetrahedron. Then we have the other tetrahedron with the base here behind with one of the faces here. And generate and it generates other nets , other links create in the cube.

So now we have a cube and x a huge one.

So what we will have here is that this cube will divide the faces like the roof of a house. Divide the faces and what does this create? Scored the cameron.

So here we have the tetrahedron. And of course , each one of the nodes of the centers will have another structure. The one that we will know as Ipersehedron.

So from here we repeat exactly the same system because we have tetrahedron. We start to create tetrahedron again towards the outside. And this structure keeps going eternally.

So always network that we have here is basically this network that we have in here.

## Practice Structure

So this basically here is the structure of every molecule of every particle that Tirana virus that is created in the universe basically is this. And then it starts to to complete and diverse in cells and life and so on until we appear.

So this is kind of the same way in which the mind of the universe manifests like it does in our neurons.

So we have a neuron and another neuron connecting.

So in our neurons basically it 's kind of this is a node and then the connection to another node , the connections to another node neurons.

So they repeat the same system to share information. Which in the geometry is exactly the same. One node or neuron connection , an edge , another neuron or node with a connection in an edge.

So it 's exactly the same.

So the same way in which our brain interprets information and shares information through the neurons , the nerve system , the mind of the universe , they also go through the edges and nodes of the geometry.

So all information is moving around here.

So in this structure , from the outside , we receive data codes that will get inside this structure in the same way as in a physical way is through the senses. The senses sense data , sense data to the nerves and the neurons and the mystery that data is exactly the same.

So now this information that comes to us in our brain will be interpreted by the neurons. But the neurons in order to administer that information will need to administer to storage that information according to the previous informations that we got. This is why the brain will try to look in the previous data in order to see if it 's possible to understand what is receiving. The same thing happened in the geometry.

If we receive a shape that does n't feed our geometry will be all rejected or forcing this geometry to shape itself in order to be able to accept the new data.

So now remember that every one of the edges is just vibration , it 's a constant rhythm.

So if I receive a data that is very high in a rhythm , so it could harm me. It 's not synchronized.

So that 's why it 's not resonant. Here we bring again the concept of resonance. If it does n't rebound with me , so I wo n't be able to accept it. Even if it is good , it will hurt me.

It hurt my structure.

So what happened if the information that comes is exactly in the same level of vibration that I have.

So it will perfectly feed within me.

So it starts to move through all the structure around , which we call to be or to have rhythm or to be on the wave.

Okay.

So what this is doing that the structure violates moves according to the vibration that it receives. This is that what makes that when we receive a specific music certain music , our body needs to move. It 's not that wants to move. No , we need to move.

And this is what takes to the body to receive the rhythm to find the harmony and from that the body this covers the dance.

So who are the first ones that will feel that resonance? The ones that feels that resonance , the first ones will be the positive and the negative. Positive and negative.

So they are trying to get together.

So what this does , that all the positive and the negative throughout millions of years of evolution , they will try to find the other in order to create a structure to multiply and create energy.

So when we evolve into reproductive beings , which means that we produce ourselves , when we begin to be reproductive , we will start to pull this female male male. What this does nature is that this one will need this other one to reproduce. And if you watch nature , we will see how nature uses color , sounds and diamonds as a way to attract the other one.

So what does the dance? That one of them creates a wave of energy through the movement that will reach the other one. And if there is resonance , it will attract and put in the same vibration , the same vibration both together.

So many birds , many insects , many mammals use this movement in order to attract the other one.

So humans not only started to use it for reproduction , but also when they started to work as a team in order to hunt for example , whenever they hunted a big animal , a huge animal , they started to feel so much euphoria that they jumped and they created movements that were close of celebration. Like when the monkeys move like this.

So this movement in between a group of people created an emotional links in between each one of them that make the group to be much more closer. And that we did the concept of celebrating through these singing and dancing.

So these jumps , these paintings that they did to celebrate basically are the summary of the unity in a group.

So that 's why it started to evolve also in ceremonies that they used the dances in ceremonies. Eventually when they discovered what they felt as they were celebrating this moments of this moments of celebration , what they discovered is that they had much more power when they started to imitate the animals or the nature.

So they created this idea that by moving like the animals , by moving like the trees and the wind , like moving like insects and birds in nature , you would encode inside of you the power of that being , the attributes of that nature.

So they started to create these movements to imitate these animals that created the dances , the biodances , which is the dance of all together imitate in life , nature.

So they were able to embrace and to receive the power of nature , the beauty of nature within themselves by imitating the animals and the plants.

So this starts to give tools to humanity , not only to imitate and be beauty and have beauty but also as tools to be centered.

So in some cultures it created dances in some other martial arts.

So dances start to be as a tool , as a technology for humans to download the beauty and information of the entire universe.

So eventually it comes a moment when dance starts to receive also technique , metric structure.

So it starts to become much complex because before it was about imitate in nature but now it has specific goals. Specific goals would be to acknowledge that according to how you move your hand in which direction going up , down , how fast , as slow , all this movements will help you to know which kind of energy are you moving , what for are you moving it?

So it creates a perfect structure of the dancing.

So if you take a look into the movements of the dance what you will see is that you create an edge going to a node.

So you are creating lines and dots and geometry around.

So you start to weave everything. You start to weave your geometry , your torus around , spinning in your own axis like the earth , moving your hands , moving your legs , creating the entire network , doing the tetrahedron , the dotted can be in the end , everything around through the movement of your body , moving energy , moving information within yourself.

So we have different kind of dances but actually what goes through all of them is that it is the manifestation of the mind figuring out how to become aware of what has created.

So basically dance is not only to dance something. It 's a way in which we can connect with the information of our soul with a spirit. It 's a way in which we can manifest and leave the constant movement of the information that goes through time and space in our soul.

So I do n't know if you have ever thought to understand dancing through entropy and entropy in the universe but they are quite connected. Once that this basically dancing is trying to put order into the constant movement of chaos , of expansion.

## Daily Practice Elements

So actually dancing is a conscious or unconscious way of bringing entropy to entropy. Let 's go to information for the line today. The vibration is rho. The statement is I am guardian of the world.
