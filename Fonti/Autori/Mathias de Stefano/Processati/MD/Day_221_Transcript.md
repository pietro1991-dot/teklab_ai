# Day 221 - The Void: Empathy and the Ultimate Freedom

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Crown
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Emotional Week
- **Main Topic:** The Void, Empathy, Nihilism, and Cosmic Freedom
- **Vibration:** `Pa`
- **Statement:** `I Am Spiritual Will`
- **Code:** Power (to can) - when filling the cosmos, the being is able to recognize what it is capable of. It recognizes its inner potential, the energy it has, the forces that are emanated from its being, and through potency emerges. The vibration generates energy just like movement generates emotions. From energy, inertia originates. The greater potency leads to unconscious action that by becoming conscious with practice takes control of the energy and localizes the potency, calling it power. This, "to can," is the attribute of conscious management of emotional energy.

## Overview

Today we begin the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, and perhaps we were waiting for something different to begin this week than the void. But there is a reason why we start here.

From the point of view of different archetypes, the void means different things. For Taurus, the void would be not having anything physical. For Scorpio, it would be going to the deepest, darkest part of the soul. For Virgo, it would be entropy—no order. For Capricorn, there is no purpose, no meaning.

But from the point of view of **Pisces**, this is the **real void**—the complete, total void. All the other voids are just aspects of the whole. For Pisces, it is the void itself.

The key to understanding Pisces is **empathy**. Empathy is what allows Pisces to feel the void of everyone, the emptiness of the entire universe. While other archetypes feel their own version of void, **Pisces feels the void of all beings simultaneously**.

This teaching connects to the crown chakra, where we touch the spiritual realm and recognize that we are ultimately nothing and everything at once—pure consciousness experiencing the void.

## Understanding Empathy

### The Origin of the Word

**Empathy** comes from Greek: **"em"** (to be in) + **"pathos"** (pain, suffering, conflict). Empathy literally means **to be in pain**, to be inside the same conflict or disease as another.

Pathology, for example, comes from the same root—the study of disease.

### How Empathy Works

We describe empathy today as the ability to put yourself in the pain of another, to feel what they are feeling.

This happens because your brain is programmed to **survive**. When it sees something happening to someone else, the brain says: "Alert! We need to protect ourselves." So the brain creates the same pain in your body so you can feel it and protect yourself.

A humorous example: many men have felt this when seeing someone kicked in the testicles. Suddenly, even through a screen, your body hurts too. This is your brain trying to understand and protect.

### Empathy vs. Sympathy

**Empathy** means feeling exactly what the other person is feeling—being one with them in their experience.

**Sympathy** (from **"syn"** meaning "with") means being **with** someone in their pain but not necessarily feeling it yourself. You accompany them, you are there, but you maintain some separation.

Gemini and Libra are sympathetic—they can be with you. Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are empathic—they actually feel your pain as their own.

### Pisces: Universal Empathy

While other signs are empathic with specific aspects, **Pisces is empathic with everything**: humans, animals, plants, minerals, the planet, the galaxy, the cosmos.

Pisces will feel not just human pain but the suffering of a tree, the loneliness of a stone, the void of the entire universe.

This is why when Pisces connects with the void of everything, feeling the emptiness of the entire universe, **Pisces feels the void of everyone**—all beings simultaneously.

## Pisces and the Zodiac Cycle

### The Last Step and the First

For humans, the circle of the zodiac signs ends in Pisces. This means **Pisces gives the basis to begin a new cycle**.

The month of Pisces is the last step but also the one that guides toward Aries, the first. **Aries cannot ignite unless Pisces does its job**.

### What Comes After?

Imagine if the Path of I Am really ended in Pisces—in this expanded void of unconditional spirituality. What would we do after that?

The next four months (Aries through Cancer) will be the ones to **manifest something new**. We cannot manifest anything new if we don't transcend everything we need to do in Pisces.

This is why we must go through the **dark night of the soul** in Pisces before we can ignite the fire of Aries.

### The Empathic Void

In order to gain something new, we must go to this very void—**the void of Pisces**, which is the **empathic void**.

What is the biggest void you can imagine? **The end of all forms and expectations.**

This is the void that everyone on a spiritual path tries to avoid. But it is necessary.

---

## The Void from Different Dimensions

### Third Dimension: Good, Bad, and Sense

We as humans live in the third dimension through **height**, **width**, and **depth**. Morally, we call these **good**, **bad**, and **sense** (meaning, direction).

Height and width are designed by our biology as good and bad because we are designed to move forward, looking ahead. We think good things are in front (the future) and bad things are behind (the past).

This is biological—we organize our morality according to how we move in our environment.

The **depth** (sense) is about meaning, direction, the sense of life—where we are heading.

### Higher Dimensions: Too Many Meanings

In the fourth dimension, the sense of life can be backwards, and you're still going to the future. Sense transforms.

In the fifth and sixth dimensions, there are **thousands of senses**, thousands of directions, all at once.

When you go high enough, you see that **everything has so much meaning** that suddenly **nothing has a correct direction**. You lose the sense because there is no one specific path.

### The Void: No Sense

The crisis of the void comes when you see that everything has so much sense that suddenly **it doesn't have a correct direction**. You realize there is **no sense**, only void, because nothing really makes sense.

This happens only at the last point of the whole path because Pisces can position itself in each one of the other eleven signs. Pisces can feel the void of each of them, the paths and senses of all of them, and recognize that **all together, they don't have any sense**.

They have so much sense that there is no direction to go.

---

## Nihilism: When Nothing Has Meaning

### The Concept

**Nihilism** comes from Latin **"nihil"** meaning **nothing**. Nihilism describes that **nothing has really meaning**—there is no sense in anything we do.

Psychologically, this comes from the concept that humans try to give meaning to things that don't really have meaning by themselves.

### Pareidolia: Seeing Patterns That Aren't There

This connects to **pareidolia**—a function of our brain that helped us survive for millions of years.

**Pareidolia** comes from **"para"** (against) + **"eidolon"** (shape, form). It is the brain's tendency to decode images and put them everywhere.

A baby sees the face of the mother and father, and the brain captures that image. Forever after, the baby looks for that pattern—eyes, nose, mouth—to feel safe. This is why you can see faces everywhere in clouds, in wood grain, in objects.

The brain was designed to see the eyes of predators so you could protect yourself. Pareidolia helped us survive.

### Pareidolia Creates Spirituality

From pareidolia come two words: **idea** (a shape, a form) and **idol** (a figure we follow, try to be like).

The idea and the idol came together to create the image of God, of beings we admire—angels, archangels with human shapes.

**Pareidolia is what helped humans create spirituality and religion**—the idea of gods, goddesses, divine beings.

Nihilism says: all the things we believe, all the things we project out there, **they don't exist**. They are just projections of our mind trying to look for figures that make us feel safe.

## The Void from Physics

### 99.9% Empty Space

From the point of view of physics, we can see matter—a physical body. But really, all matter is made of **atoms** so tiny that when you measure the distance between subatomic particles (electrons, neutrons, protons), there is **so much space** between them that most of reality is **vacuum, void**.

To understand the scale: imagine a proton is like a tennis ball in the middle of a football stadium. Now put a tiny glass ball outside the stadium at the door. That's the distance between particles.

There's **nothing** in between.

We can say that **99.9% of reality is void** and just **0.001% is matter**.

### We Are Cosmic Pareidolia

From physics: we are nothing.  
From psychology: we are nothing.

**What are we really? We are cosmic pareidolia.**

From both perspectives—physics and psychology—we don't exist. We are patterns our minds create from emptiness.

---

## The Void Is Freedom

### The Ultimate Liberation

So why do we exist? Why are we here?

We exist because **the void is freedom**—the biggest freedom you could possibly imagine.

There is no word in any human language to describe how it feels to be that void, to feel that eternity, to feel so fully, playfully aware of that freedom.

We are so bounded by our beliefs, so enslaved by our feelings, so attached to our physical history, that when we try to understand or feel the real freedom, **we perceive it as nonsense**.

There is nothing in our history of evolution that can explain how it feels—how fully you feel in that freedom.

### Not Describable

We cannot even describe it as "the biggest freedom" because when we speak about freedom, we usually mean escaping from one place to go to another—to **exist** (ex-sistere: to be outside).

But the void is not about going from one place to another. The void **is**.

### The Liberation, Not Depression

Our entire being was designed to hold life, to hold everything. That is why it is so difficult for us to let go toward nothing.

But when we realize this, it doesn't mean we have to leave behind all the things we believe, all the things we feel.

When we realize this, we understand that **everything is pareidolia**—angels, archangels, masters, **we ourselves** don't exist. They're not real. But not because only they don't exist—**we don't exist either**. We are all just ideas, images manifested.

This is **conceptual demo**—in order to create a new reality, we must demo ourselves from the concepts of our previous life.

## Conceptual Demo: The Example of Sugar

### Living Sugar Behind

When you start a diet, the first thing people say is: leave sugar behind. Stop eating sugar so your body can clean up, feel better, have more energy.

If you clean up, you lose weight. Perfect. You have to leave sugar to feel better, to make a new aspect of yourself.

The question: **did sugar stop existing?**

I stopped eating it. If there's a birthday with chocolate, I will deny it—or maybe take some and enjoy it. Will I say sugar doesn't exist?

### Sugar Still Exists

The body eats chocolate because it needs to fill a gap, to fill a void. It's attached. It **needs** it.

When you say "I can't eat it anymore," that's an **addiction**. When you grab and eat things or do things and you don't know what would happen if you stopped, that's addiction.

When you definitely decide to stop, some people feel depressed, feel a void inside: "What is happening to me? I am feeling so sad."

Why? Because the body is trying to fill that void. That's an addiction. When you feel sad feeling that void, it means whatever you had before was an addiction, not real.

### Blaming the Sugar

Sometimes people who are dieting start to blame the sugar: "Sugar is the problem. Sugar is bad. I don't want sugar. If everyone is eating sugar, you shouldn't eat that. That's poison. Throw it away. I don't want to see it."

Do you know people who do the same not only with chocolate but with **religion**? They were in a religion, and suddenly: "Religion is shit. It's poison. It doesn't exist. It's not real. It's all bullshit. Take it away. I don't want to know anything about it."

Many people blame the things they were attached to when they wanted to stop. But **they were attaching themselves**.

The sugar is there. The religion is there. Me being on a diet, not eating chocolate, doesn't make chocolate disappear from the system.

### Chocolate Still Has Value

I'm not eating it anymore in my diet. I'm cleaning up myself. But the chocolate is there. Why can't I share sugar and chocolate with friends sometimes?

I can. It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

## The Existential Void and Unconditional Pisces

### Not Destroying Spirituality

When we discover this existential void, the nihilism of the entire universe, it doesn't mean you have to stop believing in other things or that nothing really is there.

What it means is: **I am not attached more to those concepts**. It is me who decides to live them. It is me who might enjoy them.

**Everything is an idea**, and the only thing that transforms an idea is **my will**.

### The Demo

This week, activate that **will of demo** of all these concepts. Really activate the unconditional nature of Pisces.

We cannot be unconditional beings having **pre-concepts**. This is why Pisces invites us to demo all pre-concepts in order to really be unconditional.

For example, from Matias's vision as a Leo: his existential void would be to say, "I am not important. I am not doing anything great. It doesn't matter how great what I do is. It doesn't have any meaning."

For him, with 12,000 years of background and stories telling him what to do, having goals, past lives, guides, masters, interdimensional beings, aliens telling him what to do—proving that what he's doing is important—the void teaches: **all of that is not important anymore. It does not matter.**

### Realizing They Are Aspects of Yourself

When Matias went through this process, he realized: all the people he has been, all the beings he hears from the past, from other dimensions, aliens telling him what to do—they are really **aspects of himself in different dimensions**.

It is **him** telling himself what to do.

So it's not that those beings in different times and spaces don't exist. It means it was him who pushed them to exist in order to tell him that he is important.

Because if all those beings he pushed wouldn't have told him he is important, he wouldn't have done anything he did.

### The Key

In that moment, he recognizes that all those beings really exist. And it was through the void that all of them, as himself, are telling him what to do—**because he is the one choosing to do it**.

This is why he did the experience he is sharing: because he went through the experience of void to eliminate all these preconceptions.

So now he can say: **I am not important. I am really not important.**

**That's why I choose to be important.**

And that's why the entire universe pushed him to be so.

**That's the key of void.**

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. Take a deep breath. Become aware of the place where you are, and use your imagination to expand it toward the infinite, perceiving how the world vanishes into eternity.

### Perceiving Energy

Try to perceive the heat and the cold of your body, the energy that is within it. Feel the energy moving around—outside and inside, like clouds, like waves in the sea.

Recognize that this heat, this energy, is the flow of all the magnetic fields that hold the atoms of your body. The energy is being expanded from the particles in their constant movement, dancing as waves throughout your body.

### Energy as Emotion

Recognize that this flow of energy movement is what you recognize as **emotion**.

Become aware of the emotions you can feel right now throughout your body. Allow yourself to feel what is present in you.

### Bringing to the Core

Set the intention to bring all this flow of energy and emotions to the **core of your body**, to the inner aspect of yourself, to your soul.

As you take a deep breath, feel the energy of all these atoms and particles being absorbed by this **black hole** inside of your being.

### The Explosion

Take a deep breath and make this black hole explode with all its energy and power, making your entire body explode.

Dissolve every molecule, every atom, every particle, extending all that you were around the cosmos. Dissolve what you are. Break it into pieces, like after an explosion of a sun, a star.

### Recognizing the Void

Become aware that **you were really nothing**. You are void.

All those particles were shaping the idea that holds the nothingness that you are.

**Enjoy** all the beliefs you have, all the feelings you felt, all the actions you took—they were just an idea, a shape, an image holding the nothing that you are.

"I am just a conjunction of concepts."

### Creating from the Void

It is this, by becoming conscious, why you can complete yourself again from a **new concept**.

Start to take a deep breath, bringing all these molecules, all these particles, toward you again. But this time, organize them according to the **new concepts**, the new idea of yourself.

**Create your new concepts of who you are. Shape your body again.**

Use the emotion, the soul, the wonder, the love, the idea to manifest.

### Recognizing Your Will

This is how you recognize that your entire existence is just **your will to be**.

Sound the vibration **Pa**.

**I am spiritual will. I am spiritual will.**

**I am the Alpha. I am the everything.**

**I believe in me. I believe in me.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and start to expand this energy, this awareness, through the soul to the energy of the body.

Feel yourself able to expand it. Smile to this nothing and to this everything that you are.

Each one in your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, contemplate this question: **What if nothing I do has ultimate meaning?**

Don't let this depress you. Let it **liberate** you.

If nothing has inherent meaning, then **you are free to create any meaning you choose**. You are not bound by cosmic obligation. You act from freedom, not from fear.

### Releasing Attachment

Notice what you are attached to:
- Beliefs about yourself ("I am important," "I am spiritual," "I am a warrior of light")
- Expectations of others
- Needing things to have meaning

Practice **conceptual demo**: release these attachments like you would stop eating sugar. The concepts don't disappear—you just stop being controlled by them.

### Recognizing Pareidolia

When you see an angel, a guide, a vision—recognize it as **pareidolia**: a pattern your mind creates from the void.

This doesn't make it "not real." It makes it **your creation**. And that is more powerful.

---

## Week Context

We are beginning the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where we dissolve boundaries and feel the empathic connection with all beings.

Pisces teaches us to feel **everything**, including the void itself. This week, we go through the dark night of the soul—the realization that nothing has inherent meaning—so we can be reborn in Aries with **true freedom and authentic will**.

The crown chakra (today's focus) is where we touch the divine and realize: **we are nothing, and we are everything**. Pure consciousness experiencing the void.

---

## Q&A

### Q: If everything is pareidolia and nothing exists, why do anything?

Because **the void is freedom**, and from that freedom, you can **choose** to create, to act, to love. Not because you have to, but because you **want to**. That is true power—acting from freedom, not from obligation or fear.

### Q: Isn't nihilism depressing?

Nihilism can be depressing if you think it means "nothing matters, so why bother." But the void teaching is different: "Nothing has inherent meaning, **so I am free to create my own meaning**." That is liberating, not depressing.

### Q: How can I feel empathy like Pisces without being overwhelmed?

Recognize that the empathy you feel is **your own energy reflecting back to you**. When you feel someone's pain, you're not taking on their burden—you're recognizing that **you are them**. All beings are aspects of the one void. Surrender to the connection, don't fight it.

### Q: If angels and guides don't exist, what was I experiencing?

They **do** exist—as **aspects of yourself** in different dimensions. You created them by pushing consciousness into those forms. They are real manifestations of your will. The liberation comes from realizing: **you are the source**, not a powerless receiver.

### Q: What is conceptual demo?

It is the process of **releasing attachment to concepts** to create something new. Like stopping sugar to cleanse your body, you stop believing old concepts to cleanse your consciousness. The concepts don't disappear—you just stop being controlled by them.

### Q: How is the void freedom when it feels like nothingness?

Because in nothingness, there are **no limits, no obligations, no boundaries**. You are not trapped by anything. From that space, you can create anything. The void is not empty—it is **full of infinite potential**.

### Q: If I'm not important, why does it matter what I do?

You're **not important** from the cosmic perspective—and that frees you to **choose** to be important. The universe doesn't need you to do anything. **You choose** to do it. That choice, from freedom rather than obligation, is what gives your actions authentic power.
