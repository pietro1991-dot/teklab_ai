## Overview

On the thirteenth day of alignment, we work with the throat chakra in the emotional week, focusing on opening our hearts to be coherent with what we feel within. The most important teaching today is recognizing that we cannot blame or thank other people for what we feel. Every emotion we feel is within ourselves. Nothing we really feel is related to others—it is related to what we feel within.

The vibration "He" combines "H" (life and history) with "E" (balance). The sound "E" represents balance, like a scale in the middle of the heart with both hands balancing two aspects of ourselves. Today's statement is "I Am the Life in Coherence," emphasizing the heart as the center of balance between mind and body, receiving and giving.

This session includes a powerful teaching on the body as a musical instrument, with the heart as the hole where all vibrations resonate. We learn about tuning our emotional chords through the chakras and discover the true meaning of the cross symbol—not as crucifixion, but as the balance between what we think, what we do, what we receive, and what we give.

## Core Teaching

### Opening the Heart to Coherence

The work today is about opening our hearts to be coherent with what we feel within. The most important thing to understand is that we cannot blame or thank other people about what we feel. Every emotion we feel is within ourselves. Nothing we really feel is related to others; it is related to what we feel within.

This is why the work to balance the heart and the connection of love, of that emotion we feel with others, is to balance the instrument of ourselves.

### The Body as a Musical Instrument

The main way to understand how we feel and what we feel is to picture ourselves like a guitar, a musical instrument. Imagine the whole of the guitar is in your heart. All the emotions are the vibrations that represent the chords that cross the body through the main part. Then the chakras are these keys that fix the chords in order to sound properly.

Everything we feel, everything we resonate with, is according to how we are vibrating ourselves with them. What we have to do to feel the proper emotion from the outside world is to try to adjust the chakras—to tune the chords so they can sound correctly. This is our job, our work.

We cannot blame others or thank others for what we feel. We have to recognize that everything we feel from others is according to how we have tuned our emotions in this instrument, in this guitar. The place where we are going to feel this is in the hole, which is the hole of the guitar. This is the place where everything will sound. That is why we have to balance it.

### Tuning the Chakras: Direction of Spin

Someone asked about the correct sense for the chakras to spin in order to balance them and tune up the chords. Here is the answer:

Look at your right hand with the thumb pointing up. When the thumb is pointing up, all the other fingers go into one direction—they move like this. It means the energy is being pulled up. Your fingers go to the left. The energy moving to the left pushes the energy up.

The energy going down is moving right. In order to download the energy, the chakras must be spinning to the right, bringing the energy with this hand. This hand (the right hand) is the one that gives the energy and moves the energy. It doesn't matter if you are left-handed or right-handed. This one is the one that moves the energy—it's the positive one.

There's no correct place where it must spin. What matters is that they spin and that they are aligned—all in balance, all spinning in the same direction.

### The Heart as the Center of Balance

The reason the heart is the balance is that it is in the center between the mind and the body, between the thinking and the doing. It is also in between the receiving and the giving. It is like in a cross—the sign of the cross.

### Re-Signifying the Cross

Beyond Christianity, the cross represents precisely the balance between what I feel, what I think, what I do, what I receive, and what I give. For sure, many of us come from a tradition that is Christian, and there is a lot of weight, karma, and judgment over the cross, over that symbol.

One thing we would like to do is to make a new meaning, to re-signify the symbol. It is good for all of us who maybe had a judgment over the symbol across history to re-signify it, to give it a new meaning—or actually, the correct meaning it had in the past.

The cross was not about the crucifixion. It was about the meaning. It is good for all of us to give a new meaning to the symbol. The first meaning, the core meaning of the cross, was to remember to be balanced with what you think, what you do, what you receive, and what you give. This is what you are doing, basically.

### The Vibration and Code of the Day

The sound "He" is not "high" like you would read in English; it is "He." The reason is that in the ancient languages of the region, the sound "Ha" means life and history, and the sound "E" represents balance. It is like a scale in the middle of the heart with both hands balancing two aspects of ourselves.

The code of today is the vibration "Ah." It is not "A"; it means the letter "A" represents eternity, and it is pierced by the second sound of the origin—the force of the spirit, the energy. It sees everything, knows everything, generates everything. The "Ah" represents the skies from the eye consciousness who observes and guides the creation.

The sound was related with the falcon, with the hawk, the eagle—the bird that is watching everything. They related this with the spirit.
