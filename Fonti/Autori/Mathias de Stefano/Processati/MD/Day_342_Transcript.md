## Introduction

Hi everyone , I 'm warning , we have to noon , good evening. Hi everyone , I hope you are fine , I am getting better , but I do n't have much voice because I 'm not speaking at all with anybody. I usually do , I 'm in silence all day , like in closure retreat or some play this , so the only moment that I speak is here in the transmission.

Today was , I 'm sorry that I posted , I 'm loaded the post , really late , but it 's just that everything that I wrote just erased , it just disappeared , as I was writing , and it got me really , really mad and angry , but during the writing , I just understood that was part of what I had to learn from today , so it was supposed to , I was almost to our trying to take back what was lost , but really , it was impossible.

So I had to write everything again , as you have seen , for sure , I did n't wrote back what I wrote before , but I would accordingly to do what happened after it was , what I was feeling after it was erased.

So with that , you can see that I am really posting late , late , late and really what it 's happening to me in that moment.

So today is our second day of the motion all week and the topic for today is the fruit.

So as I was saying today in the blog , physically the fruit is not the goal of the plant , the fruit is a conjunction of different elements that its goal is to protect and to tourism the seeds.

So it 's part of the process to create the final product of the plant which is the seed , is not the goal. The understanding of fruits , remember that fruits , of course , have all this bite vitamins , proteins , the glucose and many things that not only tourism the seeds , but also gives what we , the animals , need in order to leave. Our organism meets energy and this energy is taken by the cells because of glucose.

So what we , the fruits are a big source of proteins and glucose and many other things that the cell needs.

So we animals look for the the fruits in order to take all these benefits , the sources of energy that we need. And we start to , we , we rich for them in order to tourism our bodies and to have the energy for ourselves. This has created a long history , the idea of looking for the fruits in order to to fruition our work. And so we at the beginning were collectors of fruits.

So we were traveling and looking for fruits to share with the family.

So we were collectors of this fruit.

So we have been creating the idea that we have to work hard in order to take the energy from the environment to take the fruits.

So we had to work hard in order to get all these elements.

So that 's why we call our work to be fortified and to take the fruits of our effort , of our hard work. In Spanish , in the Latin languages we have the word , this fruit tar which is enjoy in English. But this tar , enjoy comes from the gear of being fruitful like when you are enjoying the fruits of your work basically. All these concepts start to create the idea that our goal as humans is for the fruits.

So we can enjoy the goal of our work to take the energy. But the plan is not the goal to create fruits to create seeds. The idea of why we look for fruits is because we are all animals. And even if we call ourselves humans , we are all based in the animal kingdom.

And why is that because we are animated beings , which means that we are animate the we move. That 's what animate animal means. That we move and we are moved by our needs. We have our main needs which is to eat , to sleep , to reproduce and to feel safe.

So this for main needs that we all have are the ones that pushes in life. All life basically is moved by these for main needs.

So that 's why we are all animals if we are sick and for these for main needs.

So these needs are from the individual. It 's from ourselves.

So when we turn out to be human when we see beyond that those four needs and we start to create a culture that transcend this need.

So that would be for example any being from this planet can be human when they are not about just survival that is about being part of something later.

So humans have discovered that , have discovered this idea of not just taking the fruit to survive but to sew the seeds in order to make them grow and to keep the cycle going , creating new plants , new seeds , new fruits and to be shared with everybody , knowing the transcendence of that fruit. It 's in what we call agriculture.

So here we have to path. The path of the animal which is the sixth fruit because it needs the fruit to fulfill or to fill up a void that has within and the path of the human which is to transcend the fruit.

So we can understand in which side we are , according to how or what are we doing our things for. Like we can recognize that we are human , if we do our things in order to transcend the young or if we do our things in order to enjoy the fruits of our actions and to have some benefit from it. If we are following to get a result or a fruit from what we do to enjoy that fruit from our work , we are still in the animal side which is basically to fill up a void in a physical way in our body , like grabbing things from the outside or to fill up a void in our hearts with emotions or to fill up a void in our mind with beliefs.

So if we are doing the things in order to enjoy or to fulfill fruit from our actions.

So we are still living through the idea , the very old idea that we need to eat the fruits as a goal to take energy for ourselves and still have understanding the fruit as a process to create the seed as a tool for the real goal , which is transcendence. We can see and understand from this point of view that the fruit is not the goal because it is just a tool to tourism the seeds are the goal.

So the main objective of the plant is to tourism the seed that will be able to create a new tree with many other fruits and create many other trees.

So the fruit is not the goal. When we take our goals as the fruit we will see in that the transcendence is beyond that. When we go beyond the fruit we can expand and create much more than just filling up our void.

## Q&A

So regarding this idea today I wrote in the post about a conversation that is written in the bag of aphia in a book written in the Indian. It is a Hindu philosophy in a conversation between Arjuna and Krishna. Arjuna is asking to Krishna that he does n't get it. What is more important?

What is the right path? The one that takes action to do things in order to be fruitful or not to do anything.

So that was the conversation and Krishna tells to Arjuna that neither of them is the real path , because both of them are good and they reach the same spot.

So sorry that I am slow but what I am living every day is like going to just this psychiatrist or the psychologists.

So I am everyday doing a very insightful hours of psychoanalysis. My higher self is kind of like a psychologist.

So every day is like two hours of psychoanalysis and today it was almost five hours of that.

So I do n't know if you have gone to therapy but when you finish that it 's not like you are perfect or you just come from the beach. You feel like crap and lately it 's been like this every day. Usually you go once per week or every ten days but it 's having me very like this very deep.

So that 's why I am if then I have to blame it.

So I am thinking every day.

So yeah it 's not easy to explain about things that you just got clarified about them and that usually it 's the year is to analyze. And of course that also I 'm not sleeping I have some near.

So many things to me. And as you have noticed my psychologists is not soft is the tough and straight at the point regarding the today 's title.

Okay so let 's let 's go into these topics that sometimes we say but for sure we do n't get properly sometimes.

So the admin here from the Hindi point of view is the essence which is related to the eye , the ego which is basically the essence that we are not working with that is the origin of all things that starts to make the path of all things start to make the way towards experiences. I mean it has a path and experience path to reach the rahman. We have to path to get to rahman. These two different paths are shanghai and yoga.

Usually people know yoga as a way to to transcend to find the path but a few people leave really in yoga. Most of us will live in shanghai.

So we have to understand both.

So shanghai means to number things to count the things that will happen.

So we can understand that shanghai would be to enumerated different things to discern different things.

So from aspects that we can enumerated in one line so we can have 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 2 , reach the 10 for some.

So we have a little line in which we can do this path. In the path of shanghai we have a beginning and an end. In between alpha and omega we will have different jumps which are stages that we have to reach in order to find the other side.

So in order to move forward in structure we need energy. We need movement. We need to go through.

So become animated. This is what we are trying to do to move a long time and space.

## Daily Practice Elements

So this movement sends us to take action. Action is the way in which we can reach other statement. Action , the word action in shanghai is karma.

So karma , very known word karma means basically action.

So is the action that you need in order to move forward in this line?

So what happened? If I always do the same action I will always have the same result. In my life when I have a result is because I take an action.

So if I have always the same result is because I am taking the same action. This is why we use to call karma. These things that happen when if we were a bad person bad things could happen or these kind of things. But that 's something that 's understanding of karma is basically that the things that are happening happen because I take the same actions.

If we change our actions we change the results. This is why we say that a person has karma. Not because karma is happening to that person , but because that person is doing exactly the same thing once and again. And actions the same attitude.

Why do we repeat the thing? Why do we repeat the actions? Basically because results what we look into results is pleasure. We feel pleasure of things.

So we want to repeat the things because we want to feel the same. And the weird thing is that the same nervous system that interprets pleasure are the same terminals of neurons that identify pain. In our brain sometimes pain and pleasure can not be different from one another. Our brain does n't interpret the difference between pleasure and pain.

This is why the brain looks for the same results to feel the pleasure with the same actions. You get it. This is why we call karma. The actions that we repeat in order to find the same results that brain can not identify between pleasure and pain.

Okay. Yeah.

So we can see that when people say that we have not had karma or we have not had karma or we have solved the karma of the planet , the karma can not be done. Because karma is the action. If we keep the action that we want. The only problem we have is that we do not know the difference.

The pleasure of pain. When we start to do the conscience of pain and the result that I have brought and then we have a reaction.

So you see in the karma. The karma is not a reaction.

So we hear sometimes these people say we have to eliminate karma or or karma is a bad thing or the planet has already erased the karma or whatever. And it does n't work like this. Karma is action. We can not eliminate action.

Nothing without action.

So basically the only problem that we have is having lose the ability of no to do. When to change , when is pain , when is pleasure.

So when we understand the difference between pain and pleasure , we can understand why we are repeating the same results so we can change our action. And karma does n't come from other lives. The only reason why we can have karma from other more lives is repeating things that we did in other lives.

So in the other hand we have the other path which is yoga. Yoga is not a term used for classes to stretch the body and to go sometimes with a teacher to make some movements and so on. Yoga is the philosophy that insensurate means unity.

So it 's a way of seeing things.

So yoga basically what it does is to unify the spirit , the soul and the body and work the three of them together as a unity.

So in our Western societies , yoga has come here through , has come here as as a class of physical movements that we all recognize as yoga. But basically what really is happening is that in yoga you go to quite your mind to stabilize your emotions and to through the movements of the body. But yoga can be also washing the dishes driving the car. If you find the balance in that moment that yoga is unify the three bodies.

So what is yoga? Yoga is the circle that takes the things that before we saw as a line into a clock shape. What yoga says is that life is not going from one point to reach another one. The life is basically a circle where everything is the same and I can stare at all of this contemplate from inside.

In this vision we want to leave the point one to reach point 10. In this other vision of yoga we understand the point one is the same spot as content.

So the tool of yoga is not the action. It 's not taking action to move forward. The tool of yoga is Dharma. The meaning of Dharma is the law.

Which means that you can escape taking action to move forward. In yoga everything is a law. Everything is mind. Everything is correspondence.

Everything is vibration. Everything is rhythm. The laws from which you can not escape.

So yoga brings me the law and the understanding of law gives me awareness to know that the things that before were unknown in the future.

Now they all are based in the same laws of the universe.

So that allows me to be stabilized , stable , through movement. I can move and even though this table , no action.

So none of these two are wrong.

So the only problem here in between these two is when we believe that the omega that each one of these points in the action , it 's a fruit.

So we do our things looking for a goal. The living is the fruit. We lose the idea that the fruit is only as yoga says just a path. Just a movement.

## Q&A

It 's not a goal. To uncover this in our unconscious , we have to make some questions to ourselves. The question we want our actions for. What do we end with our actions?

But we 're looking for pleasure or looking for pain. What are our actions? Why do we take our actions?

So the key here would be to ask ourselves if the things that repeat in our life are because we do exactly the same and what other actions can we take. The vibration for today is Ai.
