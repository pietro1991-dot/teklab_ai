## Overview

Day 190. We close the Mental Week of Aquarius (note: Matias says "mind week" but this is actually the Emotional Week—the teaching itself is about **witnessing**, which bridges mind and emotion). Today we reach the **toroid chakra**—the etheric, eternal body that exists beyond physical form, beyond linear time.

And our topic is **Draco**, the Dragon constellation.

Before we go further, Matias spends significant time **clearing misconceptions** about this constellation. Because in New Age spirituality, YouTube videos, and conspiracy theories, Draco has become associated with "evil reptilians," "the bad aliens," "the Draconian empire that controls humanity."

Matias says: **Stop. This is cosmic racism.**

He explains that **the names of constellations have nothing to do with what's happening in those star systems**. Constellations are our **point of view** from Earth—they're patterns we create by connecting dots in the sky. From another planet, those same stars don't form the same shapes.

When we say "Draco is full of reptilians" or "Pleiadians are enlightened beings," we're projecting **our mythology, our psychology, our prejudices** onto the stars. We're doing to the galaxy what we do on Earth: dividing people into "good countries" and "bad countries," "good races" and "bad races."

This is not how it works.

So today's teaching has two layers:
1. **Clearing the mythology** (understanding what Draco actually represents astronomically and psychologically)
2. **Embracing the archetype** (the Dragon as guardian, as the eternal witness at the center of all cycles)

This is a teaching about **letting go of cosmic prejudice** and **becoming the watcher**—the one who sees all, judges nothing, and remains at the center while everything else spins.

## Core Teaching

### Clearing the Myths: Draco Is Not "The Reptilian Empire"

Matias begins with a necessary correction.

He says: "Usually when we say 'Dragon' in Latin (which is 'Draco'), we think of reptilians, bad people, evil aliens trying to control Earth. So I want to clear this mythology for a moment."

Here's the truth:

**The names of constellations are based on OUR point of view, not on what's happening in those star systems.**

For example:
- The **Pleiades** are in the constellation **Taurus**, but that doesn't mean the beings from the Pleiades are bulls or that they live in "Taurus energy." It just means that from Earth's perspective, those stars appear near the pattern we call Taurus.
- The **Draco constellation** was named by ancient Greeks because the pattern of stars **looks like a dragon** (a serpent winding through the northern sky). But that doesn't mean the beings from those star systems are dragons or reptiles.

Matias emphasizes:

**"We are living through mythology. We project our beliefs onto the stars, but the stars themselves are not living that mythology. The mythology is OURS—it's our psychological projection."**

When New Age spirituality says "Draconians are evil reptilians" or "Pleiadians are enlightened light beings," it's doing the same thing humans do on Earth: creating **cosmic racism**.

It's like saying: "Everyone from Argentina is this way. Everyone from Spain is that way. Everyone from the United States is another way."

But you can't say a whole country is "the bad ones" or "the good ones." And you definitely can't say a whole **constellation** (which isn't even a real structure—it's just our perception) is evil or good.

Matias says: **"I know we are very racist here on Earth, but let's try not to make this racism something galactic. Let's not project our prejudices onto the whole galaxy."**

This is important. Because when you believe "Draconians are bad," you're creating fear, division, and separation—the exact opposite of what spiritual awakening is about.

### The True Meaning of "Dragon"

So if Draco doesn't mean "evil reptilians," what does it mean?

The word **Dragon** comes from the Greek **"drakōn"**, which comes from **"derkesthai"**, which means **"to see clearly"** or **"to watch intently."**

A dragon, in the original Greek understanding, is **"the one who watches."** The one who sees. The one who guards.

**"Arcane"** is the root word—meaning **"to look straight, to see deeply."**

So the Dragon is not a monster. The Dragon is **the guardian**. The watcher. The protector. The one who takes care of something by keeping constant vigilance.

In ancient Greek culture, dragons were placed at the entrances to cities, temples, and treasures—not as threats, but as **guardians**. They were the ones who watched over what was sacred.

This is what Draco represents: **The eternal watcher. The guardian at the center.**

### Draco: The Constellation That Never Moves

Here's where it gets astronomically beautiful.

Draco is the **only constellation in the northern sky that remains constantly visible and fixed in position** throughout the entire year. While other constellations rise and set, appear and disappear with the seasons, **Draco is always there**.

Why? Because Draco is positioned near the **celestial north pole**—the point in the sky that the Earth's axis points toward.

But here's the key: **The Earth's axis is not fixed. It wobbles.**

This wobble is called the **precession of the equinoxes**, and it takes **26,000 years** to complete one full cycle. As the Earth's axis slowly shifts, the "north star" changes.

Right now, in our time, the north star is **Polaris** (in the constellation Ursa Minor).

But if we go back in time:
- **3,000 years ago** (around the time of ancient Egypt), the north star was **Thuban** (Alpha Draconis)—a star **in the Draco constellation**.
- **12,000 years ago** (around the fall of Atlantis), the north star was **Vega** (in the constellation Lyra).
- If we go further back, the axis pointed to other stars: **Errai** (in Cepheus), **Alderamin** (also in Cepheus).

The cycle continues, and eventually, the north star will return to **Thuban** again in about 23,000 years.

Now, here's what's profound:

If you draw a circle showing all the stars that the Earth's axis points to over the 26,000-year cycle—Polaris, Thuban, Vega, Errai, Alderamin, and so on—you create a **wheel in the sky**. A circle of time.

And at the **center of that circle** is the **Draco constellation**.

Specifically, at the very heart of Draco, there is a point that remains **perfectly still** while everything else revolves around it.

**This is the heart of the Dragon.**

### The Heart of the Dragon: The Eternal Witness

Matias draws this beautifully:

Imagine the celestial north pole as a wheel, spinning slowly over 26,000 years. The north star changes—Polaris, Thuban, Vega—marking different eras, different ages, different epochs.

But at the **center** of that wheel, unchanging, unmoving, is the **heart of Draco**.

The Dragon's heart **watches everything**. It sees all the constellations. It sees all the northern stars. It sees the entire cycle of time—past, present, future—all at once.

The Dragon is **the eternal witness**.

It is not involved in the drama. It is not part of the cycle. It simply **watches**. It guards. It sees.

This is the archetype of Draco: **The one who remains at the center while everything else spins.**

### Psychology vs. Astronomy: Don't Confuse Them

Matias makes a critical distinction:

**"Astronomy and etymology (the origin of words) are one thing. Mythology and psychology are another. Don't mix them."**

- **Astronomy**: The stars, their positions, their movements. Draco is a constellation near the north pole.
- **Etymology**: The word "dragon" means "to watch, to see clearly, to guard."
- **Mythology**: The stories we tell about dragons—heroes slaying them, treasures guarded by them, monsters to be defeated.
- **Psychology**: Our inner relationship to the dragon archetype—our fears, our shadows, our need for guardians and protectors.

The mistake people make is **projecting mythology onto astronomy** and thinking the two are the same.

When you say "Draconians are reptilian aliens trying to control Earth," you're taking a **psychological fear** (the shadow, the monster, the controller) and projecting it onto **astronomical objects** (stars in the Draco constellation).

But the stars don't care about your mythology. The stars are just stars.

The **mythology is yours**. The **psychology is yours**. And if you're seeing dragons as evil, that's **your inner work to do**—it's not a fact about the galaxy.

## Practice

### Becoming the Watcher at the Center

Today's practice is about **stepping into the heart of the Dragon**—the eternal witness, the guardian, the center that does not move.

**Step 1: Feel the Spin**  
Stand up. Spin slowly in a circle, arms out wide. Feel the world moving around you. Feel time passing. Feel the seasons, the years, the cycles.

This is the 26,000-year precession. This is the wheel of time. You are part of it, spinning with it.

**Step 2: Find the Center**  
Now stop spinning. Stand perfectly still. Close your eyes.

Recognize: **There is a part of you that does not spin. There is a part of you that watches the spinning but is not moved by it.**

This is your **eternal self**. This is the heart of the Dragon. This is the toroid—the etheric body that exists beyond time, beyond form, beyond birth and death.

**Step 3: Watch Without Judgment**  
Sit or stand in stillness. Imagine you are at the center of a great wheel. Around you, all of life is spinning—people, events, emotions, thoughts, dramas, stories.

But you are **the watcher**. You see it all. You guard it all. But you are not caught in it.

Say internally: "I watch. I see. I guard. But I do not judge. I do not interfere. I simply am."

**Step 4: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"Hh"** three times—a breath-like sound, almost a sigh. Feel it resonate in your entire being, not just one chakra. This is the toroid, the etheric body, the eternal field.

Then speak: **"I Am the Eternal Life."**  
You are not just this body, this personality, this moment. You are the life that moves through all forms, all times, all cycles. You are eternal.

**Step 5: Release Cosmic Racism**  
Ask yourself: "What cosmic beliefs am I holding that divide beings into 'good' and 'bad'?"

Maybe you believe Pleiadians are good and Draconians are bad. Maybe you believe certain star systems are enlightened and others are dark.

Let it go. Say: "I release my need to divide the cosmos into enemies and allies. All are part of the whole. All are watched by the Dragon."

**Step 6: Rest in the Heart**  
Place your hands over your heart. Feel the stillness there—the center, the axis, the point that does not move.

You are the heart of the Dragon. You are the eternal witness. You are the guardian of your own cosmos.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Map Your Prejudices:**  
Write down any beliefs you have about star systems, constellations, or alien races. Examples:
- "Pleiadians are enlightened"
- "Draconians are evil"
- "Sirians are advanced"
- "Orion beings are controllers"

Now ask: "Where did I learn this? Is this based on astronomy, or is it based on mythology and fear?"

Release the need to divide the cosmos into good and bad. Say: "All are part of the whole."

**Find Your Still Point:**  
Today, when life feels chaotic or overwhelming, pause. Close your eyes. Find the **still point** inside you—the place that doesn't spin, doesn't react, doesn't move.

This is the heart of the Dragon. This is your eternal self. Rest there.

**Practice Watching Without Judging:**  
Choose one situation today where you normally react or judge. Instead, **watch**. See what happens without labeling it as good or bad, right or wrong.

You are the Dragon. You are the guardian. You watch. You see. You do not interfere.

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching today is: **Don't project your mythology onto the cosmos. And don't confuse your point of view with objective truth.**

When you believe certain stars, beings, or constellations are "evil," you're creating separation and fear. When you recognize that **all of this is mythology—your stories, your projections**—you can step back, become the watcher, and see the whole without judgment.

The Dragon doesn't fight. The Dragon **guards**. It watches over what is sacred—and what is sacred is **everything**.

You are not here to divide the cosmos into teams. You are here to **witness the whole**, to guard your own center, and to remain still while everything else spins.

## Aquarius Emotional Week Context

We close the Emotional Week of Aquarius with the **toroid chakra** (Hh - I Am the Eternal Life). The toroid represents the etheric body, the eternal self, the part of you that exists beyond time and form.

Draco, as the heart of the precessional cycle, embodies this perfectly. It is the **center that does not move**, the eternal witness, the guardian of all time.

This week has taken us through fire (Phoenix), water (Argo Navis), earth (Hercules), and now **ether** (Draco)—the element that transcends all others, the space in which everything exists.

The Aquarius teaching is complete: **You are not just a mental being (last week) or an emotional being (this week). You are an eternal being—the watcher, the witness, the heart of the Dragon.**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: Why is the belief in "evil Draconians" considered cosmic racism?

Because it projects human prejudice onto the stars. Just as we can't say "everyone from this country is bad," we can't say "all beings from this constellation are evil." Constellations are our point of view—they're patterns we create by connecting dots. The mythology is ours, not the stars'. When we divide the cosmos into "good aliens" and "bad aliens," we're doing galactic prejudice.

### Q: What does "dragon" actually mean?

Dragon comes from Greek "drakōn," which comes from "derkesthai," meaning "to see clearly, to watch intently." The dragon is the **guardian**—the one who watches, protects, and sees deeply. In ancient cultures, dragons were placed at entrances to cities and temples as protectors, not monsters.

### Q: Why is Draco called "the constellation that never moves"?

Because Draco is positioned near the celestial north pole, it remains visible in the northern sky year-round. While other constellations rise and set with the seasons, Draco is always there—constant, unchanging, watching.

### Q: What is the heart of the Dragon?

The heart of the Dragon is the center point of the 26,000-year precessional cycle. As Earth's axis wobbles and the north star changes (Polaris, Thuban, Vega, etc.), those stars trace a circle in the sky. At the center of that circle—perfectly still, unmoving—is the heart of Draco. It's the eternal witness, the point that watches all of time.

### Q: How do I become the watcher?

Find the still point inside you—the part that doesn't react, doesn't spin with the drama, doesn't get caught in the cycle. This is your eternal self. Practice observing your life without judgment. Watch your thoughts, emotions, and actions as if you're the Dragon—seeing everything clearly but not interfering.

### Q: What does "I Am the Eternal Life" mean?

You are not limited to this body, this lifetime, this moment. You are the life force that moves through all forms, all times, all cycles. You are eternal. You existed before you were born, and you will exist after you die. You are the watcher, the witness, the heart of the Dragon that never moves.

### Q: Why is it important to separate astronomy from mythology?

Because confusing the two leads to false beliefs and cosmic prejudice. Astronomy tells us where stars are. Mythology tells us stories we've created about those stars. Psychology reveals our inner relationship to those stories. When you project your mythology onto the stars and think it's objective truth, you create division and fear. Recognize: The mythology is **yours**—it's your work to integrate.
