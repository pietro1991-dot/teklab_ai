## Overview

Welcome to Day 26, where we explore the sacral chakra through the adrenal glands—the organs that produce adrenaline and give us the strength, will, and energy to take action in the world. These small but powerful glands sit atop the kidneys and are the physical source of our capacity to act, to move, to express our will.

While we often associate the sacral chakra with the womb, belly, and intestines where energy is created through digestion and nutrient absorption, today we focus specifically on the adrenal glands located at the level of the middle back, on top of the kidneys. These glands are what activate the sacral chakra's power, translating the energy created by digestion into the will and strength to take action.

This teaching addresses a critical pattern of suffering: what happens when our energy gets stuck. When we want to act but can't, when we're stopped from expressing our will, when fear prevents us from moving forward—all that energy has to go somewhere. It gets locked in the kidneys and adrenal region, transforming into frustration and fear.

The profound insight here is understanding the relationship between action and energy: we create energy through absorbing nutrients from the outside world, and this energy is meant to flow through us into action. When action is blocked, energy becomes stuck, and stuck energy becomes illness. The teaching reveals that "to be ill" is related to "to stay still"—when we stop moving energy, when we lock it inside rather than letting it flow into action, we make ourselves sick.

## Core Teaching

### The Adrenal Glands: Location and Function

The adrenal glands are small, triangular-shaped glands that sit on top of each kidney, hence their name (ad-renal means "at the kidney"). They are located in the middle back region, roughly at the level of the sacral chakra.

These glands are part of the endocrine system and produce several crucial hormones, most famously adrenaline (also called epinephrine) and cortisol. Adrenaline is the hormone of action—it gives us energy, strength, focus, and the capacity to respond to challenges. It's what kicks in during the "fight or flight" response, making our heart beat faster, sending blood to our muscles, sharpening our senses, and preparing us to take immediate action.

Cortisol is often called the stress hormone, but it has many essential functions beyond stress response. It helps regulate metabolism, reduces inflammation, controls blood sugar, and helps us wake up in the morning and maintain energy throughout the day.

From an energetic perspective, the adrenal glands are what give power to the sacral chakra. They translate the energy created through digestion and nutrient absorption into actual capacity for action. They are the engine that allows will to become deed, intention to become movement, energy to become expression.

### The Creation of Energy: From Outside to Inside

The teaching emphasizes that most of the energy we receive in our body is created by the absorption of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals from everything we eat. All the energy from the food we consume goes through the digestive system.

This is why the sacral region is so important—it's the place where we create energy through the process of digestion and absorption. Food from the outside world is broken down, absorbed, and transformed into our own energy. This is the fundamental alchemical process: transmuting external matter into internal vitality.

The sacral chakra works with polarity—positive and negative, yang and yin, creative and receptive. It receives from the outside (nutrients, experiences, energy) and creates from within (vitality, action, expression). It is the center from which all energy is created, the base from which all the energy that allows us to have strength and will originates.

Understanding this helps us see that our vitality is not generated in isolation. We are constantly receiving from the environment, processing what we receive, and transforming it into the energy that powers our life and action. When this process is blocked—when we can't properly receive, digest, or transform—our vitality and will are compromised.

### Adrenaline: The Hormone of Will and Action

The adrenal glands create adrenaline, the hormone that helps us have will, strength, and the capacity to take action. Adrenaline is the physical substance that translates intention into manifestation, that gives us the power to do what we choose to do.

When adrenaline surges through our system, we feel energized, focused, capable. Our muscles are ready to move. Our mind is alert. We have the strength to face challenges, to take decisive action, to express our will powerfully in the world.

This is the positive function of adrenaline and the adrenal glands: they empower us to act. They give us the vitality and strength to live our lives fully, to pursue our goals, to respond to situations, to express our creative and sexual energy, to move through the world with power and purpose.

Problems arise not with the existence of adrenaline, but with chronic activation (constant stress wearing out the adrenals) or with blocking the action that adrenaline prepares us for (having the energy to act but not being able to express it).

### When Action Is Blocked: The Creation of Frustration

The teaching addresses what happens when we block ourselves from taking action. The moment we cannot express action, the moment we are stopped from doing what we want or need to do, the moment we cannot move forward—all the energy that was prepared for action gets locked.

This locked energy accumulates in the kidneys and adrenal region. The adrenals produce adrenaline to prepare us for action, but if we don't or can't act, that energy has nowhere to go. It gets stuck, and stuck energy transforms into frustration.

Frustration is literally the feeling of "I am not being able to act." I have the will, I have the energy, I have the intention—but I cannot express it. Something is stopping me. This creates an internal pressure, a sense of being trapped, of potential that cannot be realized.

Over time, chronic frustration—constantly having energy locked in the sacral/kidney/adrenal region without outlet—can lead to physical problems in this area: kidney issues, adrenal fatigue, lower back pain, sacral imbalances. The energy that was meant to flow out into action instead builds up and creates pressure, tension, and eventually illness.

The teaching is clear: we must move energy. Energy is meant to flow, not to be stored indefinitely. When we stop the movement of energy, when we lock it inside, we create problems.

### Fear: The Other Face of Blocked Energy

Fear is closely related to frustration in this teaching. Both are emotions that arise when energy is stuck in the sacral/adrenal region. Fear is specifically the emotion of "I am afraid of doing something"—I have energy, but fear prevents me from taking action.

Fear serves a valid purpose when it protects us from genuine danger. But often, fear stops us from taking action that would actually be beneficial or necessary. We're afraid to speak up, afraid to make a change, afraid to take a risk, afraid to express ourselves—and so we freeze. We don't act.

When fear becomes chronic, when we are constantly afraid and therefore constantly stopping ourselves from action, the energy accumulates just like with frustration. We prepare for action (adrenaline flows) but then don't act (fear stops us), and the energy gets locked in the body.

Both frustration and fear are symptoms of the same root problem: energy that is stuck because action is blocked. The solution in both cases is the same: move the energy. Take action. Find a way to express what wants to be expressed, to do what wants to be done, to let the energy flow through and out rather than staying trapped inside.

### Illness as Stillness: The Connection Between Stuck Energy and Disease

One of the most powerful insights in today's teaching is the linguistic and energetic connection between being ill and staying still. "To be ill" is related to "to stay still."

When we picture the idea of locking energy inside, of not being able to move forward with energy, we can understand how stopping that flow creates illness. Energy is meant to move. Life is movement. When we stop moving, when we hold everything in place, when we become still—we create the conditions for disease.

This doesn't mean you can never rest or that all stillness is bad. Rest and stillness are necessary for integration and renewal. But there's a difference between conscious rest (choosing to be still, allowing the body to repair and restore) and stuck stillness (energy that wants to move but can't, action that wants to happen but is blocked).

Stuck stillness is what creates problems. It's the feeling of being trapped, frozen, unable to move forward in life. It's having energy with no outlet, will with no expression, potential with no manifestation. This stuck quality is what often underlies chronic illness, particularly in the sacral region, kidneys, adrenals, and lower back.

The path to healing is often found in movement—not necessarily physical movement (though that helps), but energetic movement. Finding ways to let energy flow again, to take action in areas where you've been frozen, to express what's been suppressed, to move forward where you've been stuck.

### Forgiveness: The Key to Releasing Stuck Energy

The teaching connects to the previous day's work by reminding us that we need to forgive ourselves and forgive others in order to move energy that's stuck inside the body.

Unforgiveness is a way of holding onto the past, of keeping energy locked in old patterns and old stories. When we can't forgive—whether it's ourselves for our mistakes or others for their harm—we hold that energy in our body. We stay attached to what happened, replaying it, holding onto the hurt or shame or anger.

Forgiveness doesn't mean what happened was okay. It means we release the energy that's stuck around it. We let it move. We let it go. We stop holding it inside our body.

When we forgive, energy is freed to move again. Action becomes possible. We can move forward instead of being frozen in the past. The stuck energy in the sacral region, the kidneys, the adrenals can finally be released and allowed to flow.

This is why forgiveness work is so often connected to healing physical issues in the lower body and sacral region. It's not just psychological or spiritual—it's energetic and physical. Forgiveness literally allows stuck energy to move, which allows the body to heal.

### Sexual Energy and the Sacral Chakra

The teaching briefly mentions that the sacral chakra is related to sexual energy and the feminine aspect. While this isn't developed extensively in today's transcript, it's an important connection.

The sacral chakra governs creativity, sexuality, pleasure, and the flow of life force. The adrenals, while often associated with stress response, also play a role in sexual function and libido through their production of sex hormones.

Sexual energy is creative energy—it's the vital force that creates new life, new projects, new expressions. When sacral energy is balanced and flowing, sexual energy is healthy, creative expression is abundant, and we feel vitally alive.

When sacral energy is stuck (through fear, frustration, blocked action, unforgiveness), sexual energy is often also blocked or distorted. People may experience low libido, sexual dysfunction, or unhealthy sexual patterns as manifestations of stuck sacral energy.

Healing the sacral chakra and adrenals—moving stuck energy, releasing frustration and fear, forgiving, taking action—often naturally restores healthy sexual energy and creative vitality.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably or lie down. Bring your awareness to your middle back, to the area of your kidneys. The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys, one on each side of your spine at about the level of your bottom ribs.

Place your hands on your lower back if you're sitting, or let them rest on your sacral area (below your navel) if you're lying down. Feel warmth and energy flowing into your kidneys and adrenals.

Take several deep breaths, noticing any sensations in your lower back, kidney area, or sacrum. Is there tightness? Pain? Warmth? Emptiness? Simply notice without judgment.

Set the intention to release stuck energy, to move frustration and fear, to restore the healthy flow of vitality through your sacral chakra, and to empower your will and capacity for action.

### Main Practice: Releasing Stuck Energy and Empowering Action

**Step 1:** Scan your body and your life for stuck energy. Where do you feel blocked, frozen, unable to move forward? What action do you want to take but can't or won't? What's being held inside rather than expressed? What frustrations or fears are you carrying?

**Step 2:** Bring awareness specifically to your kidney and adrenal area. Breathe golden-orange light (the color of the sacral chakra) into this region. See or feel this light warming and energizing your adrenals, your kidneys, your entire lower back and sacral area.

**Step 3:** Acknowledge any frustration you're holding. Speak it aloud or internally: "I feel frustrated because _______." Let yourself feel the full feeling of frustration—the sense of being blocked, of having energy with no outlet, of wanting to act but being unable to.

**Step 4:** Now acknowledge any fear you're holding. Speak it: "I feel afraid of _______." Let yourself feel the fear—the sense of being frozen, of energy stopping, of protecting yourself by not acting.

**Step 5:** Recognize that both frustration and fear are stuck energy. The energy is there—the will, the strength, the vitality—but it's locked in your body instead of flowing into action. Feel where this locked energy is concentrated in your kidneys, adrenals, sacrum, or lower back.

**Step 6:** Now begin to move the energy. You can do this in several ways:
- Physical movement: rock your pelvis, do pelvic tilts, dance your hips, stretch your lower back
- Breath: breathe deeply into your belly and sacrum, then exhale forcefully, releasing energy out
- Sound: make sounds from your belly—groans, roars, whatever wants to come out
- Visualization: see the stuck energy beginning to flow, like ice melting into water, like a dam breaking and water rushing free

**Step 7:** Choose one action you've been avoiding or unable to take. It doesn't have to be huge—it can be small. But it should be something that would allow stuck energy to move. Feel the energy in your adrenals preparing you for this action. Feel adrenaline beginning to flow, giving you strength and will.

**Step 8:** Visualize yourself taking this action. See yourself doing what you've been afraid or unable to do. Feel the energy flowing from your adrenals, through your body, out into the world through your action. Feel the relief and vitality of energy moving rather than staying stuck.

**Step 9:** Practice forgiveness as a way of releasing stuck energy. Choose something you're holding onto—a resentment, a regret, a shame, an anger. Breathe into your sacral area and consciously choose to release it. Say aloud: "I forgive [myself/this person] for _______. I release this energy. I let it go. I allow it to move."

**Step 10:** Feel the energy beginning to flow again as forgiveness releases what was stuck. Your sacrum, kidneys, and adrenals begin to relax. Energy that was locked begins to circulate. You feel lighter, freer, more capable of action.

**Step 11:** Repeat the vibration "Sy" (pronounced "sue" or "soo") three times, feeling the sound vibrate in your sacral area, your kidneys, your adrenals. This vibration activates and balances the sacral chakra.

**Step 12:** Now speak the statement aloud: "I Am the Path of Action." Feel the truth of this. You are not meant to stay stuck, still, frozen. You are meant to move, to act, to express your will, to let energy flow through you into manifestation in the world.

**Step 13:** Feel your adrenals producing healthy adrenaline, giving you strength and will. Feel your kidneys releasing and moving energy rather than holding onto it. Feel your sacral chakra spinning freely, creating and moving energy.

**Step 14:** Commit to one specific action you will take today to move stuck energy. It doesn't matter how small—the point is to practice letting energy flow into action rather than staying trapped inside. Write down this commitment if possible.

**Step 15:** Rest in the state of flowing energy. Energy comes in through nourishment and absorption. It's transformed into vitality and will. It flows out through action and expression. This is the natural cycle. You are part of this flow, not a dam blocking it.

### Closing

Gently bring your awareness back to your breath and your body. Notice if your kidney/adrenal/sacral area feels different than when you began. More relaxed? More energized? More flowing?

Stand up if possible and do some gentle movement—swaying, stretching, shaking—to continue moving energy through your body and out into expression.

Journal about your experience. What stuck energy did you identify? What frustrations or fears are you holding? What action have you been avoiding that would allow energy to move? What's your commitment for releasing stuck energy and taking action?

Throughout the day, notice when you feel frustrated or afraid. Recognize these as signs of stuck energy. Practice moving the energy—through breath, through movement, through taking even small actions, through forgiveness. Don't let energy stay locked inside.

## Integration

Throughout the day, pay attention to moments when you feel frustrated or afraid. These are signals that energy wants to move but is being blocked. Instead of pushing down the frustration or suppressing the fear, recognize them as stuck energy and look for ways to move that energy.

Practice taking action, especially small actions you've been avoiding. The size doesn't matter as much as the practice of letting energy flow from intention through your body and out into manifestation. Each time you take action instead of staying stuck, you strengthen the pathway of flow.

Move your body, particularly your hips, pelvis, and lower back. Dance, stretch, do pelvic tilts, practice yoga poses that open the sacral area. Physical movement of this region helps move energetic blockages as well.

Work with forgiveness daily. Identify one thing you're holding onto—one resentment, regret, shame, or anger—and consciously choose to release it. You don't have to feel completely free of it instantly; forgiveness is a process. But each time you choose to release even a little bit, you free energy that was stuck.

Notice your patterns around action. Do you tend to push through and act even when afraid (overriding fear)? Or do you tend to freeze and not act (being controlled by fear)? Or do you prepare to act but then stop yourself at the last moment (frustration pattern)? Understanding your pattern helps you work with it more skillfully.

Assess your adrenal health. Are you exhausted? Wired and tired? Having trouble handling stress? These can be signs of adrenal imbalance. Along with appropriate rest and possibly medical support, work energetically with this region to release stuck energy and restore healthy flow.

Remember that you create your own energy, but you create it through exchange with the outside world. You take in nutrients, experiences, energy, and you transform them into your own vitality. Honor this cycle of receiving, transforming, and expressing.

## Q&A

**Q: I feel constantly frustrated but I don't know why or what action I'm not taking. What do I do?**

**A:** Frustration without a clear source often indicates stuck energy that's been there for a while, potentially from multiple blocked actions or expressions. Sit with the frustration without trying to fix it immediately. Feel where it lives in your body (probably kidney/adrenal/sacral area). Ask it: "What wants to move? What wants to be expressed? What action wants to happen?" Don't force an answer; let it emerge. Sometimes the stuck energy is from the past, and the action needed now is forgiveness or emotional release rather than a specific outer action. Movement practices, therapy, or energy work can help identify and release long-held stuck patterns.

**Q: Can constant stress damage my adrenal glands?**

**A:** Yes. Chronic stress keeps the adrenals constantly producing stress hormones (adrenaline and cortisol), which over time can lead to what's commonly called adrenal fatigue (though this term is somewhat controversial medically). The adrenals become depleted from overwork, and you may feel exhausted, have trouble handling stress, experience blood sugar issues, sleep problems, and more. The energetic pattern often involves chronic fear or the sense of always needing to act/respond to threats, never being able to rest. Healing requires both physical support (rest, nutrition, possibly supplements) and energetic work (releasing chronic fear, finding safety, allowing rest, moving stuck energy).

**Q: What's the difference between healthy action and compulsive doing?**

**A:** Healthy action is energy flowing naturally into appropriate expression—you feel called to act, you have the energy to act, you act, and the energy flows through and out, leaving you feeling satisfied or complete. Compulsive doing is more about fear or trying to control outcomes—you push yourself to act even when exhausted, you can't rest, you feel anxious if you're not doing something. Compulsive doing often comes from fear (fear of not being enough, fear of losing control, fear of what will happen if you stop) while healthy action comes from will aligned with natural energy flow. Check in with your body: does this action feel energizing and right, or draining and forced?

**Q: I tend to take action impulsively without thinking. Is this sacral imbalance?**

**A:** It could be. Balanced sacral energy involves both creation and appropriate expression of energy—there's a cycle of receiving, processing/transforming, and expressing/acting. If you're skipping the processing step and going straight from impulse to action, that suggests imbalance. This can look like too much adrenaline, not enough grounding, or fear of feeling what's happening internally so you immediately act to discharge the energy. Practice pausing between impulse and action. Feel the energy in your body. Breathe with it. Let yourself process before expressing. This doesn't mean never being spontaneous, but developing the capacity to choose when to act rather than being compulsively driven to action.

**Q: How do I know if my lower back pain is from stuck energy or just physical?**

**A:** Often it's both, and they're interrelated. Physical issues (injury, structural problems, inflammation) can create energetic blockages, and energetic blockages (stuck emotions, frustrated will, chronic fear) can manifest as physical problems. Instead of trying to determine which came first, work on all levels: appropriate physical care (medical evaluation, physical therapy, gentle movement), energetic work (like today's practice), and emotional exploration (what am I holding onto? where am I stuck in life?). Many people find that as they release stuck emotional/energetic patterns, physical symptoms improve, even with long-standing issues.

**Q: Can blocked sacral energy affect sexuality?**

**A:** Absolutely. The sacral chakra governs both creative energy and sexual energy—they're different expressions of the same life force. When sacral energy is blocked (through fear, frustration, stuck emotions, unforgiveness), sexual energy is often affected. This might show up as low libido, sexual dysfunction, inability to experience pleasure, or unhealthy sexual patterns. The adrenal glands also produce sex hormones, so chronic stress or adrenal depletion can directly affect sexual function. Healing sacral blockages—moving stuck energy, releasing fear and frustration, practicing forgiveness, taking action in other areas of life—often naturally restores healthy sexual energy.

**Q: What if taking action feels dangerous or impossible right now?**

**A:** Sometimes the external situation genuinely doesn't allow for the action you want to take, and pushing anyway would create harm. In these cases, the energy work is crucial. You can move energy internally even when external action isn't possible: process emotions, practice forgiveness, visualize the action you want to take, move the energy through breath and body movement, express through creative outlets (writing, art, dance), speak your truth even if only to yourself or a therapist. When external circumstances change and action becomes possible, you'll be ready because you didn't let the energy stay completely stuck. Also assess honestly: is action truly impossible, or am I telling myself it's impossible because of fear?

**Q: How long does it take to release stuck energy?**

**A:** This varies enormously depending on how long the energy has been stuck, how much there is, what created the blockage, and how consistently you work with it. Some stuck energy releases immediately—one good cry, one movement session, one act of forgiveness, and you feel completely different. Other patterns have been there for years or even generations (ancestral patterns) and take sustained work to shift. Be patient with yourself. Even if the stuck energy doesn't completely release immediately, each practice, each act of forgiveness, each moment of movement creates a small shift. Over time, these accumulate into significant transformation. Trust the process and stay committed.

*May your energy flow freely from creation through expression, from intention through action. May frustration and fear be transformed into movement and courage. May your will be strong, your adrenals be balanced, and your capacity for action be empowered. I Am the Path of Action.*
