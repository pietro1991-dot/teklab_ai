# Day 227 - Sensibility: The Nervous System and the Barometer of Pain

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Toroid
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Sensibility, Five Senses, Pain as Information
- **Vibration:** `Oh`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Will that Manifests`
- **Code:** To Know - the use of tools made in experience gives us wisdom. The attribute of knowing gives us the faculty of recognizing our own mistakes, learning from them, improving and becoming masters and examples to those on the path. Knowing means the faculty of acquiring knowledge not as a student but as a being—for it's not the same to take knowledge as to awaken wisdom, for wisdom is internal and only awakens by the ability to discover oneself.

## Overview

Today Matias speaks from Egypt, where 144 people have gathered to work with the 144 aspects of divinity in the three pyramids.

The topic is sensibility—not the emotional weakness we often think of, but the biological, neurological system that allows us to receive information from the outside world and interpret it.

Understanding sensibility as a measurement tool helps us see why spiritual awakening is connected to expanding our sensitivity beyond survival instincts.

---

## Context: The 144 in Egypt

### The Gathering

Today, 144 people arrived in Egypt for a special week of work. They will activate the 144 aspects of divinity through the spirit, body, and soul by working in the three pyramids every night.

The goal is to sow the seeds of what will happen in one year (in 2022), when the 144 will be activated all together.

Tomorrow (Day 228), between 5am and 7am, the 144 will be in the three pyramids simultaneously during the spring/autumn equinox.

If you want to connect with them, meditate on the 144 aspects of the universe—the concept of the one being (1) divided into many different parts (44).

## What Is Sensibility?

### Not Emotional Weakness

We often speak about sensibility as something related to suffering, sadness, being weak in perceiving others.

But to understand sensibility properly, we must understand where it comes from and how it's created in our being.

### Sensibility Comes From Senses

**Sensibility** comes from the word senses—the five senses.

The five senses are tools created by the nervous system to receive information from the outside so we can know exactly what is happening around us.

The brain designed these five tools to perceive the environment and process that information, creating a network of data that helps the body understand what's happening in the environment.

---

## How the Nervous System Works

### Information as Electrical Pulses

All information from the outside (the outer world) connects to the inside (the inner world) through electrical pulses received by energy through the nerves of the nervous system.

When this information reaches the brain (the main core), it interprets the information and activates networks that decode this data so we can feel it, perceive it, and understand the environment.

The brain and nervous system receive data through the five senses:
- Touch
- Sight
- Hearing
- Smell
- Taste

### Constant Tapping

This information comes as electrical pulses—like tiny hits, like tapping, that repeat constantly, pulling information in an electrical way to the nervous system.

Through these taps, we receive information in our brain. It's a constant tapping of data, of pulses, that we receive and process.

---

## Pain: The Barometer of Information

### Etymology of Pain

Tiny taps are called in European languages **dolor** (Latin), which gives us the English word "dolour" or "pain."

Pain comes from **poena** (Latin), meaning cause and effect, the consequence of something.

Pain is the consequence of a pulse you received to understand something. It's like the retribution of something.

### Pain as Measurement

Pain (dolor) is the way the brain measures the alarm of data received from the outside through the senses.

It's like a barometer to measure pain—the information you're receiving from the outside.

Even a caress is interpreted by the brain as pain, though not pain as we commonly understand it. The brain is receiving the idea or information through tapping from the nervous system, and it interprets this as pain.

### Good Pain and Bad Pain

According to the brain's awareness and interpretation of data, the barometer of pain goes from good pain to bad pain. But all of it is pain.

- Bad pain = suffering
- Good pain = pleasure

This explains why some people experience a caress as pleasure while others experience it as unpleasant in the skin. This happens because some people have been traumatized by touch or have bad memories about it, so the brain interprets caress as something bad.

It's all about how your brain perceives and interprets what's outside—not what's actually happening. It's just interpretation.

---

## Sensitivity and Biology

### Men vs. Women Example

Matias shares an experience when his friend was giving birth. He and others present felt headache, tired, and worse than the woman giving birth.

This is because men usually don't have as much barometer of pain as women. Women are much more prepared to receive more pain and also pleasure.

Men experience it in short periods and stronger bursts, so we don't know how to handle it as well.

The ability to handle pain, to perceive pain, is much more related to how your biology and brain have been designed to understand what's happening than what's really happening. It's just interpretation.

## Why Pain and Not Happiness?

### Survival Design

The question arises: why measure by pain and not by happiness?

Because we live in a world that is physical, not magical. Every cell of our body has been designed through thousands and millions of years to survive in this environment.

Every cell has been designed to survive in this environment. This is why the nervous system interprets external pulses always as an alert.

### Pain as Alert System

The physical body is created from energy—electrical pulses that create matter and store information.

When cells started to evolve, pain became the basement of the physical body trying to survive here.

Pain helps us realize what's happening outside:
- If my stomach is in pain, I'm hungry
- If my head is in pain, I need to sleep or stop what I'm doing

We're always on alert for things happening outside. Pain helps us realize what's occurring.

---

## From Physical to Spiritual Pain

### The Cascade

The pulse received from outside has a reaction within. That reaction activates the glands through energy.

The pulse of energy activates the glands, which push hormones to react toward the thing happening outside.

Because of this reaction, we feel emotions. Emotion is the reaction of hormones responding to pulses received from the outside.

This makes us move from the physical plane to perceiving pain in the emotional way and emotional plane.

### Accumulating Data

Once we have a way of understanding information, we start to accumulate data all the time. Everything experienced is registered in a network of neurons that creates synapses, and from that, thoughts.

This creates the mind of a human that can interpret pain before it happens. While the physical and emotional react to things as they happen, the brain stores information from the past and can intuitively understand what pain might happen next.

This is how the brain creates mental pain—we create pain even if the pain isn't there. We imagine the pain.

From this comes existential crisis, which is pain at the spiritual level.

That's the path: from physical to spiritual.

## Sensitivity Beyond Survival

### Expanding Beyond Five Senses

Once we move beyond the physical and relate to the emotional and mental, sensitivity becomes much wider. It expands into different concepts beyond our five senses.

### Mammals and Group Protection

Until a certain point in evolution, bodies tried to protect themselves and survive as individuals, looking for their own survival.

But mammals started to understand they could survive better by protecting the group. They worked like a herd, protecting the family, the clan.

Many mammals and animals started to protect not only their own body but the bodies of those around them.

This created in our brain the ability to perceive what others are feeling so we know what to do. This creates intuition of what's happening to the other—like a mother sensing her kid's needs.

We start to perceive the emotions of others so we can understand how to help them.

### The Sixth Sense

This is not only for humans but for other animals as well. This creates among humans the ability to perceive others, to take care of others, to be in solidarity, to be helpful.

We start to be sensitive to others.

This tool that was biological becomes an attribute of the emotional and then a system for the mind in civilizations.

Sensitivity is the attribute in our evolution that helps us remember we are not individual, separated from each other. We are part of a network.

It's not only about protecting the human body with five senses. Sensitivity activates a sixth sense—to connect with others, with the entire being that we are.

## Why Sensitivity Is Difficult Today

### Thousands of Years of Survival

The reason sensitivity is so difficult to understand today is because we've been living thousands of years in contexts of survival, of fighting.

During our whole history, sensitivity was only useful for the survival of the group. But then you had to fight, do hard work, and many things to survive as a group.

You needed to fight in life. In those terms, sensitivity was considered a weakness. If you're sensitive to what the enemy is feeling, you get killed.

This is why sensitivity was taken as weakness in a world of survival.

### The Last 100 Years: Living, Not Surviving

This may be difficult to understand because we complain all the time, but the last hundred years were the first century in which people stopped surviving and started living.

Before, people needed to survive, to fight for things. Since a hundred years ago, we started creating a system in which we are living, not surviving, because we're not fighting anymore to get stuff.

Most people in the world stopped surviving and started living. It doesn't mean you're living good or bad—you can complain all you want—but you are living, not surviving.

Why? Because you are here, not fighting for food. You're sitting, listening, using a sixth sense to expand your mind and perceive everyone as one. You're not only using your five senses to survive.

That's why you're living, not surviving.

---

## Sensitivity as Evolution

### Measuring Awakening

Now sensitivity is a key that helps us understand which people are evolving into a new humanity. Sensitivity is the way to measure if you've activated a sixth sense to understand that we're all connected.

Otherwise, you're just surviving with your five senses in this reality.

Being sensitive is a way to understand that you're getting into a new reality.

### Conscious Pain Becomes Pleasure

It's important to know that the pain and suffering we feel helps us understand we're still unaware or unconscious of things.

When you are conscious, pain turns into pleasure, not suffering.

You can measure now: your pain, your suffering, is related to your unconsciousness that you need to work with.

Sensitivity is measured by the barometer of pain. As much more aware and conscious I become, the less I suffer and I start to feel pleasure in things.

But if I still suffer for things, it's because I'm living in the unconscious of that aspect that I need to integrate still.

## Practice

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on breathing.

Take a deep breath. Feel yourself expanding with each inhalation. Feel the energy moving around your body, going into every part—the heat and cold, waves of energy moving through.

Take a deep breath. Recognize this energy as your emotions.

Perceive all these emotions inside your body, in each part of it. Take a deep breath, expanding, dissolving to the infinite like drops of water filling up an entire ocean.

Open yourself to perceive:
- The memory of the colors
- The sounds
- The textures
- The smells
- The flavors

Perceive the memory of all of them. Open yourself to perceive the emotions that come with these senses, the people connected to these emotions.

Take a deep breath and open yourself even more. Become aware that all of this that you feel, that you perceive, is a part of yourself.

As wider you open yourself to feel, you expand, connected to the network.

Recognize that this sensitivity, this capacity of feeling, allows you to take all that is expanded of you throughout the cosmos and manifest it here and now.

Take a deep breath, bringing all this sensitivity, this capacity of manifestation, and put your sensitivity toward yourself. Activate it within with your vibration.

Sound the vibration **Oh** from your toroid.

**I am the will that manifests. I am the will that manifests.**

**I believe in what I feel.**

Feel and manifest. Feel the feeling of it.

Breathe deeply. Bring this consciousness to each part of your body.

## Key Insights

- Sensibility comes from senses—the five tools the nervous system uses to receive information from outside.
- Information arrives as electrical pulses (tapping) that the brain interprets.
- Pain is not suffering—it's the brain's barometer for measuring information received from outside.
- Good pain = pleasure; bad pain = suffering. Both are pain to the brain.
- We measure by pain (not happiness) because we evolved to survive—pain is an alert system.
- Physical pain creates emotional reaction (hormones), which creates mental pain (thoughts), which creates spiritual pain (existential crisis).
- Mammals evolved to protect the group, not just individuals, creating the sixth sense of perceiving others' feelings.
- Sensitivity was considered weakness in survival contexts because it made you vulnerable to enemies.
- The last 100 years are the first time most humans are living (not surviving), allowing sensitivity to expand.
- Sensitivity measures if you've activated the sixth sense—connection to all, not just individual survival.
- When you become conscious, pain transforms into pleasure; suffering indicates unconsciousness you need to integrate.

## Integration

Today, notice when you experience pain—physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual.

Ask yourself: Is this pain alerting me to something I need to know? Or is it showing me an unconscious pattern I need to integrate?

Practice expanding your sensitivity beyond your five senses. Can you feel what someone near you is feeling without them speaking? This is the sixth sense awakening.

Remember: you are living, not just surviving. Use your sensitivity to connect to the network of all beings, not just to protect yourself.

---

## Week Context

We are in the Physical Week of Pisces, where sensitivity is key. Pisces feels the pain of all beings, using empathy and sensitivity to connect to the whole.

The toroid (today's chakra) is the eternal field that connects all—the perfect place to practice expanding sensitivity beyond individual survival into collective connection.

## Q&A

### Q: If sensitivity is evolution, why does it hurt so much?

Because you're still transitioning from survival consciousness (where sensitivity was weakness) to connection consciousness (where sensitivity is strength). The pain indicates unconscious patterns resisting the shift.

### Q: How do I develop the sixth sense?

You already have it—it's perceiving others' emotions and needs without verbal communication. Practice paying attention to what you feel around others. That's your sixth sense activating.

### Q: Why do some people handle pain better than others?

Biology and brain design create different barometers of pain. Women generally have wider barometers (more range between pleasure and suffering) than men. Trauma also affects how the brain interprets stimuli.

### Q: If pain is just interpretation, can I choose not to feel it?

You can choose how to interpret it. When you become conscious of why the pain is there (what information it's giving), it often transforms from suffering into useful data or even pleasure.

### Q: Is being sensitive the same as being empathic?

Related but different. Sensitivity is perceiving information through senses (including the sixth sense). Empathy is being in the pain of others. High sensitivity can lead to empathy, but they're distinct.

### Q: How do I know if I'm surviving or living?

If you spend most energy protecting yourself, fighting for resources, and operating from fear—you're surviving. If you have space to expand awareness, connect with others, and explore beyond basic needs—you're living.
