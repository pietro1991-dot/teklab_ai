## Introduction

Good morning , good afternoon and good evening to all of you.

Today with a 144 aspects reincarnated. They disappear.

So today we have received the 144 that came for this trip for this week. But as you see , we do n't have the space to put them all together to be all here.

So that would be impossible.

So we do n't have the tools today to be all in the same spot.

So tomorrow we will have the tools to be able all of us to be together in the garden. And so tomorrow I will show you all of them. And so we can do the elements all together.

Sorry. She was trying to sit inside us , but it was doing much more than just sitting.

So of course that we were just said that I will share a little bit the idea of why these 144 people had come here. I just had the opportunity to say hi to everyone , but I could n't really know from where they came from or anything else.

## Q&A

So I will try to know them better tomorrow. And of course I will share with them the task that we have come to do here in Egypt. I will try to share a little bit of why what we are doing this next days.

So you can be in touch with all of us and connected connecting to our energy.

So just as a tiny explanation of this of why this group of 144 has come.

Remember that we have spoken about 144 aspects of the divinity.

So our goal in this week is to work on the 144 aspects to know what they are. And we will go into the into the activation of them through the spirit of the body and the soul.

So we are going to go into the into the into the three pyramids every night the three pyramids.

So we will be there working with the body with the soul and the spirit and the main goal of this is to solve the seeds of what is going to happen in one year in 2022.

So the main goal of this is to solve the seeds of the 144 that we will activate all together in one year.

So just as I remind her , I will keep doing the elements every day as usual. Nothing 's changed. I will tell you a bit of intention that you have to put with us during the time that we are inside of the pyramid every day.

So do n't worry , I will share that with you every day we go.

So let 's go to the topic for today.

So let 's go to the topic which is sensibility or today is speak about sensibility. And I do n't worry.

So first of all to understand the sensibility as we know it today because we speak about sensibility like something that even if it is really great. Usually we relate with the suffering with the sadness and being so weak on perceive the others and so on. We have to understand from where it comes from how it is created the sensibility in our self and our being.

So we can understand how to handle it and what is the use or this sensibility. To understand sensibility or sensibility. We should understand that something that I explained in previous videos related to the five senses. Sensibility comes from senses , the word senses.

Okay , so and senses is the senses , the five senses. The five senses are tools that were created by the nervous system in order to receive the information from the outside.

So you can notify , you can know exactly what is happening around us.

So the brain designed these five tools to perceive the environment , the information from the environment and then it can process that information creating a network of data that helps the body to know what is happening in the environment.

So basically all the information that happens outside , all the things that happens in the outer world. Connect to the inside to the inner world by pulses , electrical pulses that are received by energy through the nerves of the nervous system.

So when this information comes to the main core which is the brain , it interprets that information and activate network of things that the code this data , this information so we can fill it.

So we can perceive it and understand the environment.

So remember that the brain , the nervous system , will receive the data , all the information through the senses of touch , side hearing , smelling and tasting.

So now how this information comes to us , it comes through electrical pulses.

So these electrical pulses are like tiny hits , like tiny hits that once again , once again repeat pulling this information in an electrical way to the nervous system. And by this hits that it does , we receive the information in our brain.

So it 's like a constant heating of data of pulses that we receive and process in our brain. Tiny , tiny hits are called in the European language del , which it 's the word dollar dollar in Latin languages , which for sure in English you know as dollars. You do n't use it much maybe , but there 's a word that you can compare , which is dollars. The word pain , which is a translation of dollar comes from finale that means something , means like cause and effect is the consequence of something.

So basically pain is the consequence of a pulse that you received , you will understand something.

So it 's like the retribution of something.

So basically the pain , the dollar is a way in which the brain can measure the alarm of a data that is received from the outside through the senses.

So sorry , that it 's always telling me that it 's better to say tops than little hits.

So it 's like tapping , okay , the nervous system is like receiving through tapping. This is like , is like a barometer to measure pain , which is the information that you are receiving from the outside.

So even to make a carousel is also something that the brain interprets like pain , but it 's not the pain as we understand it is receiving the the idea or the information of the pain. And because it 's receiving that this tapping constantly from the nervous system , so the brain interprets is that as as a pain. According to the interpretation of information , the awareness of the brain to interpret the data. Is how you receive the codes of this information.

So this barometer of pain goes from the good pain till the bad pain. But all of this is pain.

So we have , for example , the bad pain which is suffering and the good pain which is pleasure. But all of this is pain for the brain , okay , all of that is pain.

So this is this explains how some people or some people at carousel is like a pleasure and for some others at carousel is like a lot of nice in in the skin is terrible. And this is because some people have been traumatized by the touch or have some some bad memories about this or about experience about this.

So the brain interprets it 's a carousel as something bad.

So it 's all about how your brain perceive know exactly how it is outside.

Something that I experienced about this last month when my friend was giving birth. It was like she has given birth and she was asking how we felt because we were like headache and tired and we felt really worse than here. And it 's like men usually does n't have as much as barometer of pain than women for example or because there are much more prepared to receive much more pain and also pleasure. And men we do it in short periods and stronger.

So we do n't know how to handle.

So the ability to handle the pain to perceive the pain is much more related to how your biology and your brain has been designed to understand what is happening than what is really happening is just interpretation.

So the sensitivity is related to the ability that my brain has to interpret it the information that comes from my five senses.

So the question is why to measure this by pain and not by I do n't know happiness? Because remember that we leave in a world that is not magical or our world is physical and every cell of our body has been designed through thousands and millions of years to survive in this environment.

So every one of ourselves has been designed in order to survive in environment. This is why the nervous system interprets the pulses of external always as an alert. A hunger or of being tired of enemies.

So the whole body has been designed to be aware of all the problems that can be there. If my stomach is n't pain so it 's because I 'm hungry. If my head is in pain is because I need to sleep or stop like this.

So I 'm always alert of stuff that are happening outside.

So that 's why the pain is something that helps us to be realized.

So sorry that helps us realize what is happening in the outside. This was created like this the cell the physical is created like this because of the energy. The energy call is the pulses of electrical pulses that creates the matter and storage information.

So when the cell starts to evolve the pain is like the basement of the physical body that is trying to survive here. But the reason why this energy moves around is because sorry the reason why you feel that is because of the energy.

So all this energy that we move through the body trying to interpret the information is understood by the brain. And then it creates a reaction to that pulse.

So the pulse that we received from the outside has a reaction within.

So that reaction is the one that activates the glands by energy. Activated the pulse of energy activates the glands and the glands push the hormones to react towards that thing that is happening outside.

So because of this reaction we feel emotions.

So the motion is the reaction that hormones reacting to the pulses that you received from the outside.

So this is what makes that from the physical plane we start to perceive pain in the emotional way and emotional plane.

So once we have the way of understanding the information it starts to accumulate data all the time. It starts to register all the information in the brain.

So everything that was experienced is registered in a network of neurons that creates synapses. And from that the thoughts.

So it creates the mind of a human that interpreted the pain before they happen because the physical and emotional we are reacting to things that we are happening. But the brain , the storage information from the past , can understand previously to try to in intuitive understand what pain can happen after.

So because of this is how the brain creates the mental pain.

So we go into the mind now and we create pain even if the pain is not there. We just kind of imagine the pain.

Okay. And from that we have existential crisis which is the pain of the spiritual level.

Okay.

So that 's the path. How from the physical goes to the spiritual.

So the measurement of the pain is to understand how can we be alert on alert to all the things that are happening outside.

So once we leave behind the physical and we start to be related to the emotional and the mental. The sensitivity is much wider because it starts to expand into different other concepts that are not only my five senses that they go beyond. But they can connect wider into other minds into other connections and so on. And this is something that develops the sensitivity and it 's something that mammals created.

The mammals used basically and it was useful for our evolution.

So I will go into that.

So what mammals did was that until the moment until some moments before we started with this process of sensitivity. Most of the bodies were trying to protect themselves to survive as individuals.

So they are looking for their own survival. But the mammals starts to understand that they could survive better if they were protecting the group.

So they started to work like a herd protecting the others. The family , the herd , the clan.

So many mammals , many animals. They started to not only protect their own body but protect the body of the ones around. And that creates in our brain the ability to perceive what the others are feeling.

So you know what to do.

So this creates this intuition of what is happening to the other one , like the mother , like a kid or something like this.

So you start to perceive the emotions of the others.

So you can understand how to help the others.

So this is not only for humans , this was also for other animals. This is also for other animals even today. This is what creates in between humans mainly the ability to perceive others to take care of the others. To be solidarity with the others.

Helpful. Yeah.

So you start to be sensitive to the others.

So here where we have is a tool that was biological that starts that becomes an attribute of the emotional and then becomes a system for the mind in the civilizations.

So the sensitivity is this attribute that we have in our in evolution that helps us remember that we are not individual separated one another , one from each other , that we are part of the network that is not only about protecting the human body , about protecting myself with five senses. Sensitivity is to activate a six sense which is to connect with the others with the entire being that we are.

So the reason why the sensibility is so or sensitivity is so difficult to understand even today is because of the fact that we are not being able to do that.

Today is because we have been thousands of years living in context that was about survival that was about fighting.

Okay.

So during our whole history sensitivity was only useful for the survival of the group. But then you have to fight you have to do the hard work to do so many things in order to survive as a group or whatever.

So you need it to fight in life. Yeah. In that terms sensitivity was considered a weakness because if you are sensitive to what the enemy is feeling so you get killed.

So this is why sensitivity was something taking as a weakness in a world of survival.

So maybe it 's difficult to understand this because we are complaining all the time about all the things but the last hundred years where the first was the first century in which people stopped surviving and started to leave. Why? Because before people need to survive to fight for the things and since a hundred years ago we started to create a system in which we are living we are not surviving. Basically because we are not fighting anymore for getting stuff.

Okay.

So so most of the people in the world and saying most of the people not the whole planet most of the people of the world stop surviving and started to leave. It does n't mean that you are living good or bad you can complain whatever you want but you are living not surviving.

Okay.

So this concept that is changing makes that all our history of survival of thinking that sensitivity is a weakness is stopping.

Okay.

So most of the people are able to perceive more to be much more sensitive about the things because they have time we have time to perceive much deeply the things.

So for example there is people in the world that is surviving still there is a lot of people surviving but. The most of the population of the world right now is living not surviving for example all of you who are listening here known of you is surviving all of you are living. Why? Because you are here basically and not fighting for food.

So you are here sitting listening and why you are sensitive to a six sense which is to expand your mind to perceive everyone as one. You are not only using your five senses to survive. That 's why you are living not surviving.

So now the sensitivity is basically a key that helps us to understand which people is evolving into a new. Humanity because sensitivity is the way you can measure the dual activated a six sense to understand that we are all connected. And otherwise you are just surviving with your five senses only here in this reality. Being sensitive is kind of a way to understand that you are getting into a new reality and also important to know that the pain.

Then we feel the suffering that we feel makes us understand that we are still unaware or unconscious of things because when you are. When you are. Conscious. The pain turns into pleasure not into suffering so you can measure now.

That your pain your suffering is related to. Your unconscious. That you need to work with.

So remember that the sensitivity is measured by the barometer of the pain.

So as much aware and conscious I become the less I suffer and I start to feel pleasure of things but if I still suffer for things. It 's because I am living the unconscious of that aspect that I need to integrate still.

So let 's remember that. Sensitivity is this tool that we have to measure in which. Part of this barometer of pain we find ourselves if in the side of suffering or going to. The side of pleasure.

It 's an. An relative. Tool.

So now you know that it 's time that I say oh it hurts these or that in me or I complain about something. You can know now where 's my. In unconscious. Where am I?

## Daily Practice Elements

The. The vibration for today is. Oh. The statement for today is I am the will that manifests.

The code for today is to know. The use of tools let me stay. Made in the experience gives us wisdom. For that attribute of knowing gives us the faculty of recognizing our own mistakes learning from them improving and being able to become masters and examples to those who are on the path.

Knowing means. That is the faculty of acquiring knowledge not as a student but as a being for it 's not the same to take knowledge than. Awakening wisdom for wisdom is internal and only a ways by the ability to discover oneself not through others. Let 's go to the alignment.

We sit comfortable close rise. And concentrate in the breathing. I take you to breath. And die let myself to feel.

To expand my body. Myself. My spirit. Mind.

## Energy Work

Extend. Like opening portals. Does. Towards everywhere.

For myself. To perceive. To feel. To feel.

Me now center. The memory of the arms. Of the colors. Of the sounds.

Of the guns. The graphics. I open myself. To perceive.

The textures. The smells. The colors. He flavors.

I perceive the memory of all of them. I open myself to perceive the emotions that comes with this senses , the people connected to this emotions. I take a deep breath and opens myself even more. I feel I take a deep breath and I become aware that all of this that I feel that I perceive is a part of myself.

And as wider I open myself to feel I am able to expand , to be connected to the network. I can feel the feeling of it. It is this sensitivity. The one that allowed me to take all what is expanded of me throughout the cosmos and manifested here and now.

I take deep breath , bringing all this sensitivity , this capacity of manifestation and to put my sensitivity towards me and I activated within with my vibration. I can feel the feeling of it. I feel and I manifest. I feel the feeling of it.

I feel the feeling of it. I feel the feeling of it. I feel the feeling of it. I feel the feeling of it.
