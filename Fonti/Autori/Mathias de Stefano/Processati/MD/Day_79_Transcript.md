## Overview

We're on **Day 9 of the Emotional Week of Libra**, working with the **Ankles chakra** and exploring **Mission and Purpose**.

Before we begin, Matías shares a small detail: he tied his hair for the first time while teaching. He can feel it pulling him back, which creates an interesting metaphor for the teaching—sometimes we need to be "pulled back" to see clearly where we're going.

**Mission and Purpose** is perhaps THE most asked question in spirituality:
- "What is my mission?"
- "What is my purpose?"
- "Why am I here?"
- "What am I supposed to do with my life?"

We desperately want to know the answer before we begin. We want the roadmap, the blueprint, the guarantee that we're doing the "right thing."

But today we'll discover a revolutionary truth:

**Mission and Purpose are NOT the same thing.**

**Mission = the PATH, the journey, the process** (what you're doing step by step)

**Purpose = the DESTINATION, the goal, the final understanding** (what it all means when you arrive)

**Your mission is to LIVE—to be 100% yourself, fully, authentically, without hiding.**

**Your purpose will be revealed when your mission ends—you cannot and should not know it ahead of time.**

This teaching will free you from the desperate search for purpose and help you focus on what actually matters: living your mission fully right now.

## Core Teaching

### The Most Asked Question

**"What is my mission? What is my purpose? Why am I here?"**

This is the question Matías receives more than any other.

**People want to know their purpose before they begin living.**

They want certainty, direction, confirmation that they're on the "right path."

**But this desperate need to know purpose creates suffering:**
- Analysis paralysis (can't act without knowing the endpoint)
- Constant seeking (searching for purpose instead of living)
- Feeling lost (if purpose isn't clear, life feels meaningless)
- Comparison (others seem to have found their purpose, why haven't I?)

**Today's teaching offers a different way.**

### The Etymology: Sent and Put Ahead

**MISSION** comes from Latin **MITTERE** = to send

**A mission is: to be sent to do something**

Think of a **messenger**:

In ancient times, a messenger would be sent from one village to another village with a message.

**But here's the key understanding:**

**The mission is NOT to deliver the message.**

**The mission is to MAKE THE PATH—to travel from village to village.**

The messenger must:
- Walk the road
- Face the obstacles
- Navigate the terrain
- Survive the journey
- Experience the path

**The mission is the PROCESS, the PATH, the JOURNEY itself.**

**PURPOSE** comes from Latin **PRO** (ahead) + **PONERE** (to put)

**Purpose = to put ahead = the goal, the objective, the aim, the destination**

**Purpose is where you're GOING, what you'll UNDERSTAND when you arrive.**

**So:**

**MISSION = the path you walk, the process, the journey** (the doing)

**PURPOSE = the destination, the goal, the final understanding** (the arriving)

### Mission is Constant Process, Not Something to Finish

**Your mission is not a task to complete.**

**Your mission is NOT: "Find your purpose, accomplish it, then you're done."**

**Your mission is a constant process—the living, the experiencing, the being, the walking the path.**

Matías shares his own realization:

For a long time, he thought his mission was **imposed from outside**—something he was "supposed to do," a role he was "sent to fulfill."

**But then he realized:**

**His mission was never imposed. His mission is simply TO SHARE WHAT HE IS.**

**His mission is to BE himself 100%—and in being himself fully, he naturally shares, teaches, creates.**

**This is true for everyone:**

**Your mission is not something imposed on you from outside.**

**Your mission is to LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE 100%.**

**To be fully yourself, without hiding, without pretending, without living for others' expectations.**

### Living Others' Expectations ≠ Your Mission

**When you live according to what others expect:**
- What your parents wanted you to be
- What society says you should do
- What your culture defines as success
- What your friends think is appropriate

**You are NOT living your mission.**

**You're living THEIR mission, or what they think your mission should be.**

**The ONLY way to accomplish your mission is to live YOUR OWN LIFE 100%.**

**Not 70% yourself and 30% what others expect.**  
**Not 90% authentic and 10% performing.**

**100% yourself.**

### Mission = Karma (Learning, Acknowledging, Challenges)

**Your mission is also your KARMA.**

**Karma is not punishment.** Karma is:
- What you came to learn
- What you came to acknowledge
- What you came to experience
- The challenges you face to grow

**Your mission includes:**
- The lessons you need to learn
- The patterns you need to break
- The experiences you need to have
- The growth you need to accomplish

**These are not obstacles to your mission—they ARE your mission.**

**When you're struggling, you're not "off-mission"—you're IN your mission.**

**The path includes the obstacles. The journey includes the challenges.**

### Purpose Discovered When Mission Ends

**Purpose is what you discover when your mission ends.**

**When you ARRIVE at the destination, THEN you understand the purpose.**

Think of the messenger again:

**The messenger carries the message the whole journey.**

**But the messenger only UNDERSTANDS the message when they deliver it, when they arrive, when the journey is complete.**

**You're carrying your "message" (your purpose) your entire life.**

**But you only understand what it means when you complete the journey—when you arrive at the destination.**

**This is why you cannot and should not know your purpose ahead of time.**

### No Reason to Know Purpose Ahead of Time

**Why shouldn't you know your purpose before you live your mission?**

**Because knowing the destination creates:**

**1. Stress and desperation:**
"I know where I'm supposed to end up, but I'm not there yet, so I'm failing."

**2. Skipping the journey:**
"If I know the endpoint, I just want to get there fast—why do I have to walk this path?"

**3. Missing the lessons:**
"I'm focused on the destination, so I'm not paying attention to what I'm supposed to learn along the way."

**4. Force and control:**
"I know what's supposed to happen, so I'll force it, control it, manipulate it to make sure I arrive."

**If you knew your purpose ahead of time, you would miss your mission.**

**You would skip the journey trying to get to the destination.**

**You would miss the tools, lessons, experiences, and growth that the PATH provides—the very tools you need to accomplish the purpose when you arrive.**

### Knowing Purpose = Missing Mission Tools

**Here's the profound paradox:**

**If you knew your purpose from the beginning, you wouldn't have the TOOLS to accomplish it.**

**Because the tools are gathered DURING the mission.**

**The path GIVES you what you need for the destination.**

The messenger doesn't start the journey knowing everything about the terrain. The messenger LEARNS the terrain by walking it.

**When you arrive with the message, you've learned:**
- How to navigate obstacles
- How to survive challenges
- How to adapt to circumstances
- How to stay focused despite difficulty

**These skills—learned on the path—are what allow you to deliver the message effectively.**

**If you skipped the path to get to the destination faster, you'd arrive without the tools to fulfill the purpose.**

### Focus on Mission, Purpose Reveals Naturally

**Your work is simple:**

**Live your mission—be yourself 100%, walk your path fully, experience each step authentically.**

**As you do this, your purpose will reveal itself naturally, organically, in perfect timing.**

**You don't need to stress about purpose.**  
**You don't need to desperately search for it.**  
**You don't need to know it ahead of time.**

**Focus on living your mission fully:**
- Being yourself completely
- Walking your path authentically
- Learning your lessons deeply
- Experiencing your challenges courageously

**Purpose emerges FROM this, not before it.**

### Why Bad People Succeed and Good People Struggle

Matías shares a provocative observation:

**"Bad people" often succeed in accomplishing what they want.**

**Why?**

**Because they're 100% themselves.**

**They don't hide who they are.**  
**They don't pretend to be something they're not.**  
**They don't wait for approval or permission.**

**They simply ARE what they are—fully, completely, without apology.**

**"Good people" often struggle.**

**Why?**

**Because they're NOT being themselves.**

**They're trying to be what others expect.**  
**They're waiting for acceptance before being authentic.**  
**They're hiding parts of themselves to be "appropriate."**  
**They're performing "goodness" instead of living truth.**

**The lesson from the "dark ones" is profound:**

**Don't care what others think. Simply BE what you are. Don't hide. Just exist fully.**

**(The teaching is the principle, not the destructive application.)**

### Success = Exodus (Transformation from One Stage to Another)

**What is "success"?**

**SUCCESS comes from EXODUS = exit, to go out, to leave**

**Success is not "getting what you want" or "achieving your goals."**

**Success is TRANSFORMATION from one stage to another.**

**Exodus = leaving one state and entering another, crossing from one level to the next.**

**True success is:**
- Growing from who you were to who you're becoming
- Exiting old patterns and entering new consciousness
- Leaving limitation and entering expansion
- Transforming through the journey

**This is why "bad people" are often "successful"—they transform, they evolve, they don't stay stuck trying to be "good."**

**(Again: the lesson is about authenticity and transformation, not about being destructive.)**

### Take the Teaching, Leave the Distortion

**The dark ones teach something valuable:**

**Be yourself without apology.**  
**Don't hide.**  
**Don't wait for permission.**  
**Don't perform for approval.**

**BUT:**

**They apply this principle in DISTORTED ways—selfishly, harmfully, destructively.**

**Your work is to take the TEACHING (be yourself fully) and apply it in BALANCED ways.**

**Be 100% yourself AND be in service.**  
**Don't hide your truth AND don't harm others.**  
**Live authentically AND live with wisdom.**

**Take the lesson from the dark. Apply it in the light.**

### Yin Yang: Good Inside Bad, Bad Inside Good

**The Yin Yang symbol shows us:**

**Inside the dark (bad), there's a point of light (good).**

**Inside the light (good), there's a point of dark (bad).**

**They're not separate. They're part of each other.**

**What does this mean for mission and purpose?**

**The "bad" teaching (be yourself without caring what others think) contains the "good" wisdom (authenticity).**

**The "good" teaching (be kind, help others) can contain the "bad" distortion (lose yourself, people-please, deny your truth).**

**Everything contains its opposite. Learn from all of it.**

### Don't Sentence Before Hearing the Full Explanation

Matías offers pedagogical advice:

**Don't judge something before you've heard the full explanation.**

When he started this teaching by saying "bad people succeed because they're fully themselves," some people might have immediately judged: "He's saying we should be bad!"

**But if you LISTEN to the full teaching, you understand:**

The lesson is about **authenticity**, not destruction.

The teaching is about **being yourself**, not harming others.

The wisdom is about **taking what's useful** from all sources, including uncomfortable ones.

**This is part of the MISSION: learning to listen fully, to understand deeply, to not react immediately, to hear the complete teaching before judging.**

### Listening as Part of Meditation Practice

**Listening is part of the meditation practice.**

**Meditation is not only:**
- Sitting in silence
- Breathing deeply
- Emptying the mind

**Meditation is ALSO:**
- Listening without reacting
- Hearing fully before responding
- Being present to what is, not what you think it is
- Receiving teaching without immediate judgment

**The practice of listening deeply is training consciousness.**

### Alignment ≠ Meditation

**An important distinction:**

**ALIGNMENT is not the same as MEDITATION.**

**Alignment = coherence with a GROUP** (aligning your energy with others, creating collective field, working in unity)

**Meditation = SOLO practice** (individual consciousness work, personal connection with self/source, internal practice)

**Both are valuable. Both are necessary. But they're not the same.**

**Don't confuse collective alignment work with individual meditation practice.**

### The Septet Code: Seven Levels of Consciousness

The **Septet Code** teaches:

**"Seven energies of consciousness representing the subdivision of the Merkaba into seven levels of awareness. Each level is a complete expression of consciousness at different densities, creating the rainbow bridge between spirit and matter."**

**Your mission moves through all seven levels:**

Each level is a complete experience of consciousness at different density.

**You can't skip levels to get to the "highest."**

**You must walk through all seven, experiencing each fully, learning at each density.**

**This is the mission—the journey through all seven levels.**

**The purpose—what it all means—is revealed when you've walked all seven and can see the complete rainbow bridge from where you stand.**

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch your body. Yawn. Cross your limbs.

Relax your body, focusing on your breathing.

**Feel your hair (if you have it) or the top of your head being gently pulled back—not force, just gentle reminder to stay present, stay aware.**

### Becoming Wind

Start to perceive the air coming inside your body.

Feel how it moves inside you, making you feel like you are empty.

Only air and wind is spinning within you. Feel the air around your body connecting with the air within your body.

Feel yourself soft and light like a feather.

### The Soul's Energy

Perceive the energy of your body moving like wind within your body in a spiral of colors.

Expressing outside through the skin like a twister around you.

**This spiral moves through seven levels—the rainbow of consciousness.**

### Illuminating the Ankles

Put your hands facing the sky at the height of your heart.

Perceive the light of the I Am, of the sun, coming towards you, going through the crown and anchoring in your ankles with a beautiful rainbow light—all seven colors.

**The ankles—the joints that allow you to WALK, to move forward step by step on your path.**

Feel the rainbow light filling your ankles, creating flexibility, strength, the ability to keep walking even when the path is difficult.

Feel this light flowing down into your feet (grounding each step) and up into your hands (offering what you carry).

### Mission in One Hand

**In one hand, hold your MISSION:**

The path you walk.  
The process of being yourself 100%.  
The journey of learning, growing, experiencing.  
The karma you're working through.  
The life you're living step by step.

**Your mission is NOT far away or mysterious.**

**Your mission is: Be yourself fully. Live your life completely. Walk your path authentically.**

**That's it.**

### Purpose in the Other Hand

**In your other hand, hold your PURPOSE:**

The destination you'll reach.  
The understanding that will come when you arrive.  
The meaning that will be revealed when the journey is complete.  
The message you're carrying that you'll understand when you deliver it.

**Your purpose is NOT something you need to know now.**

**Your purpose will be revealed naturally, organically, perfectly when you've walked your mission fully.**

### Understanding the Relationship

**Mission without purpose** = walking without knowing why (feels meaningless, aimless)

**Purpose without mission** = knowing destination without walking the path (missing the tools, lessons, growth needed to fulfill the purpose)

**BOTH together** = walking the path (mission) TRUSTING that it leads somewhere meaningful (purpose), even if you don't know exactly where until you arrive.

### Releasing the Desperate Search

**Let go of the desperate need to know your purpose now.**

**You don't need to know it.**  
**You can't know it yet.**  
**You're not supposed to know it.**

**Knowing it now would create stress and cause you to miss the mission.**

**Trust that by living your mission fully (being yourself 100%), your purpose will reveal itself perfectly.**

### Checking: Am I Living My Mission?

**Ask yourself honestly:**

**Am I being 100% myself?**

Or am I:
- Performing what others expect?
- Hiding parts of myself to be "appropriate"?
- Waiting for permission to be authentic?
- Living someone else's idea of what I should be?

**If you're not being 100% yourself, you're not living your mission—no matter how "successful" you look externally.**

**Your mission is simple: Be yourself. Fully. Completely. Without hiding.**

### The Lesson from the Dark

**What can you learn from those who are fully themselves (even if destructively so)?**

**They don't:**
- Wait for approval
- Hide who they are
- Apologize for existing
- Perform for others

**They simply ARE.**

**Take this lesson: Be yourself without apology.**

**Apply it with wisdom: Be yourself in service, not destruction.**

### Unification: Walking the Rainbow Bridge

Take both hands to your ankles, bringing mission and purpose together.

**You're walking the rainbow bridge—the seven levels of consciousness from matter to spirit.**

**Your mission is the WALKING. Your purpose is what you'll understand when you've crossed the bridge.**

Unify with the vibration:

**SSfunu... SSfunu... SSfunu... SSfunu...**

**"I Am the Flux of Space."**

Space is the path, the distance to travel, the journey to walk. I am the flux moving through space—mission in motion, purpose unfolding, walking the rainbow bridge step by step.

### Listening Practice

**Before you close, practice listening:**

**Sit in silence for 2 minutes.**

**Listen without reacting.**  
**Hear what arises without judging.**  
**Be present to what IS without trying to change it.**

**This is meditation—not just sitting, but LISTENING deeply to existence.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and start to spread this consciousness, stretching, caressing, and yawning.

Come back here and now, opening your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: The 100% Yourself Check

**Every morning this week, ask:**

**"Today, will I be 100% myself? Or will I perform for others?"**

**Throughout the day, catch yourself when you:**
- Say what you think others want to hear (instead of truth)
- Hide parts of yourself to be "appropriate" (instead of authentic)
- Wait for permission to express (instead of just being)
- Perform "goodness" (instead of living from your center)

**Each time you catch yourself, ask:**

**"What would 100% me do/say/choose right now?"**

**Then do that (if it's not harmful to others).**

**This is your mission: practicing being 100% yourself in small moments, which trains you for being yourself in all moments.**

### Releasing the Purpose Obsession

**For one month, STOP searching for your purpose.**

**Stop asking:**
- "What is my purpose?"
- "Why am I here?"
- "What am I supposed to do with my life?"

**Instead, focus ONLY on mission:**
- "Am I being myself today?"
- "Am I walking my path authentically?"
- "Am I learning what this moment teaches?"
- "Am I experiencing fully without forcing outcome?"

**Notice: When you stop desperately searching for purpose, you relax into your mission. And in that relaxation, purpose often reveals itself naturally.**

**Purpose comes from LIVING, not from SEEKING.**

### Learning from the Dark (Without Becoming Destructive)

**Observe someone who is "100% themselves" (even if you don't approve of their choices):**

**What can you learn from their authenticity?**
- They don't apologize for existing
- They don't hide who they are
- They don't wait for permission
- They don't perform for approval

**Take this lesson: "I can be fully myself without waiting for anyone's permission."**

**Apply it wisely: "I'll be fully myself AND I'll choose service over destruction, wisdom over harm."**

**The dark teaches the principle (authenticity). You choose the application (wisdom).**

### The Messenger Practice

**Imagine you're a messenger carrying a sealed message.**

**You don't know what the message says (your purpose).**

**Your job is to WALK THE PATH to deliver it (your mission).**

**On the path, you:**
- Learn the terrain
- Develop skills
- Overcome obstacles
- Gather tools
- Build strength

**When you arrive (when your life's journey ends), you'll open the message and finally understand what it said (your purpose).**

**But you couldn't have understood it BEFORE walking the path, because the walking GAVE you the ability to understand.**

**Trust this process.**

**Walk your path fully. The message will make sense when you arrive.**

### Listening as Meditation

**Practice deep listening this week:**

**With people:**
- Listen to complete thoughts before responding
- Don't interrupt with your opinion
- Hear what they're saying AND what they're not saying
- Be present to THEM, not to your reaction to them

**With life:**
- Sit in silence daily
- Listen to sounds without labeling
- Feel sensations without judging
- Be present to what IS without trying to change it

**With teaching:**
- Read/hear full explanations before judging
- Sit with discomfort instead of immediately rejecting
- Look for the wisdom even in uncomfortable teachings
- Practice: "Let me hear the whole thing before I decide"

**This listening practice is training consciousness—part of walking your mission.**

## Q&A

### Q: What if I genuinely don't know what "being myself" means? How do I know who I am?

**This confusion often comes from years of performing for others.** Start small: Notice when you feel most alive, most energized, most "at home" in yourself. Notice when you feel drained, fake, performative. The alive moments = hints of authentic self. The drained moments = clues where you're not being yourself. Your mission includes DISCOVERING who you are by experimenting with being authentic in small moments and noticing what feels true.

### Q: If my mission is just "be myself," does that mean I don't need goals or direction?

**Being yourself IS the direction.** But being yourself includes your natural desires, gifts, interests, passions. If you're naturally drawn to create art—creating art is part of being yourself. If you're naturally drawn to help people—helping is part of being yourself. Goals that arise from authentic self = mission. Goals imposed from external expectations = not mission. The difference is: does this come from who I genuinely am, or who I think I should be?

### Q: What about people whose authentic self is harmful (abusers, narcissists, etc.)? Should they "be themselves"?

**There's a difference between authentic self and unhealed patterns.** Abusive behavior isn't "authentic self"—it's wounded self acting from trauma, fear, control. True authentic self, when not distorted by wounds, naturally includes care for others because we're interconnected. The teaching "be yourself" assumes you're also doing the healing work. Be yourself AND heal your wounds. Be authentic AND take responsibility for impact. Not: "Be your unhealed destructive patterns without consequence."

### Q: How do I know if I'm on the "right path" if I can't know my purpose?

**If you're being 100% yourself, you're on the right path.** The "right path" isn't a specific career or location or achievement. The right path is AUTHENTICITY. You can be yourself as a teacher, artist, parent, builder, healer—many forms. The form matters less than the authenticity. If you're genuinely being yourself, learning, growing, experiencing—you're walking your mission. Purpose will clarify from there.

### Q: What if being "100% myself" means disappointing people I love?

**Then you face the mission challenge: choosing authentic self over others' expectations.** This doesn't mean being cruel or careless. It means: "I love you AND I must be myself. I honor your disappointment AND I won't abandon my truth to avoid it." Often the people who truly love you will respect your authenticity even if initially disappointed. And if they can't—that's information about the relationship's health, not about whether you should be yourself.

### Q: The "bad people succeed" teaching seems to glorify being selfish or harmful. How is this spiritual?

**It's not glorifying—it's OBSERVING a principle and extracting wisdom.** The observation: people who are fully themselves (even destructively) often "succeed" because they're not held back by performance/approval-seeking. The wisdom: authenticity creates power. The application: be authentic in SERVICE, not destruction. Take the principle (don't hide, don't wait for permission), apply it wisely (be yourself in ways that serve). The teaching is about learning from all sources, even uncomfortable ones.

### Q: If I focus only on mission (not purpose), won't I just wander aimlessly?

**No—because being yourself ISN'T aimless.** Your authentic self has natural directions, interests, gifts, desires. Following those authentically creates direction. What creates aimlessness is PERFORMING (being what others want) which disconnects you from your natural guidance. When you're being yourself, you naturally move toward what resonates, what calls you, what you're meant to experience. That's not aimless—that's authentic navigation.

### Q: When will I know my purpose? How do I recognize it when it arrives?

**You'll know when your mission ends—which for most people means at death or major life transformation.** But purpose also reveals in MOMENTS throughout life—when you look back and suddenly see the pattern, the meaning, the "why" of what you've walked through. It's not one dramatic revelation—it's ongoing glimpses that clarify as you continue the journey. Trust that understanding deepens over time. You don't need to "recognize" it formally—you'll KNOW when clarity comes.

## Closing Reflection

Today we've explored **Mission and Purpose**—two concepts we often confuse but that are fundamentally different.

**Mission = the PATH, the journey, the process** (what you're doing step by step, how you're living)

**Purpose = the DESTINATION, the goal, the final understanding** (what it all means when you arrive)

**Your mission is simple and clear:**

**Be yourself 100%.**

**Live your own life, not others' expectations.**

**Walk your path authentically, fully, without hiding.**

**Experience your challenges as part of the journey, not obstacles to it.**

**Your purpose is mysterious and future:**

**You don't need to know it now.**

**You can't know it yet.**

**You're not supposed to know it.**

**It will be revealed when you've walked your mission fully—when you "deliver the message" you've been carrying.**

**The desperate search for purpose creates suffering:**
- Stress (not knowing feels like failing)
- Skipping (trying to get to destination without walking path)
- Missing (focused on endpoint, missing the lessons of the journey)
- Forcing (trying to control outcome instead of experiencing process)

**The focus on mission creates peace:**
- Clarity (I know what to do today: be myself)
- Presence (I'm here on the path, not obsessed with destination)
- Learning (I'm gathering tools through experience)
- Trust (the path knows where it's going even if I don't)

**The messenger metaphor is perfect:**

You carry the message (your purpose) your whole life.

But you only UNDERSTAND the message when you deliver it (when you arrive).

**If you knew the message now, you'd skip the journey.**

**But the JOURNEY gives you the tools to understand and fulfill the message when you arrive.**

**The dark ones teach us something valuable** (even if we don't approve of their application):

**Be yourself without apology.**  
**Don't hide.**  
**Don't wait for permission.**  
**Don't perform for approval.**

**Take this teaching. Apply it in balance:**

**Be 100% yourself AND be in service.**

**Don't hide your truth AND don't harm others.**

**Live authentically AND live with wisdom.**

**The Septet Code** reminds us: You're walking through seven levels of consciousness, the rainbow bridge from matter to spirit.

**You can't skip levels. You must walk each one.**

**Your mission is the WALKING. Your purpose is what you'll understand when you've crossed the bridge.**

**"I Am the Flux of Space."**

Space is the distance to travel, the journey to walk, the path to experience.

**You are the flux moving through space—mission in motion, purpose unfolding, walking step by step.**

**Your work today is not to know where you're going.**

**Your work today is to BE YOURSELF FULLY right here, right now, on this step of the path.**

**Trust that by walking authentically, you'll arrive perfectly.**

See you tomorrow for Day 80—the final day of Emotional Week—as we explore Balance and Imbalance.

Rest well. Drink water. Be yourself. Walk your path.
