## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning , afternoon. Good evening. We have two weddings around.

I had to move to another place as always.

## Q&A

So for those people who are asking how is that , that energy we do n't have , the lockdown , because of COVID , I should say that here in Egypt has not been locked down for many months.

So there 's not a lockdown here. But I do n't know if that is because Africa is doing it really well or because we all have COVID , so nobody noticed. We do n't really know.

So I guess Egypt is doing better than Europe and America 's.

So we are doing it so wrong that nobody cares.

So today I must say that I have been a little bit weird. I think you were doing the worship today in English.

So sorry that I have to leave. I will try to finish it in another moment. But basically , I have a stressed suddenly. Not like stress of being nervous , but just stress inside.

And this is because , of course , I am not teaching you things.

So you do the process. I am doing the process with you every day. There are many things that I have no idea that I am going to touch to speak to ride.

So for me , it is also a process.

So today was a hard work inside for me. And suddenly I had the the the the workshop in the campus. And I suddenly got this stress where I lost the connection. I lost the.

I lost it.

So emotionally and mentally I felt like I was forgotten.

So that 's why I needed to cut the the connection today in the worship. And to to pay attention to my body that that told me to rest and sleep.

So I did it. No doubt.

So that 's. That 's because of working with the self daily.

So I did n't say worship. I said workshop workshop. It was a conference I was doing in the conference in in the campus. Our thing.

So of course you will you will see myself changing a bit like. With all this work , the inner work. That 's normal that sometimes you would see me like low energies.

Sometimes very happy. It 's changed constantly.

So of course. According to my personality. I 'm Leo.

So I have no problem to be here. Speaking to thousands of people. And be myself. I do n't care.

I like this. But I have my other health which is. I have my other health which is.

So I have my other health which is.

So sometimes I need. For me to be quiet alone. Nobody to ask me things. Nobody to be around.

And just to be myself inside the cave. And being alone. I do n't have to. But I need to clarify things because of this pedagogy that I have inside.

And I 'm saying clarify. I just to clarify this. There were some people concerned about. If I am in this state like.

Like getting sick and with this cough and all this. Because of what I am channeling or or any. Anything that I am. Or saving from the energy going to the pyramids or whatever.

And no it 's it 's not that. I be in feeling like this since March.

Okay.

So it 's an inner process. I do n't blame any being anyone that I am channeling. It 's making me bad. Going to the pyramids.

It 's not making me bad. If I feel wrong. If I feel sick. If I feel bad.

It 's basically because. I allow it.

So it 's my responsibility and my. Your responsibility. If I did n't take care of myself.

So.

So all this things the coaching all this things that I am feeling is basically my own. I 'm coherence trying to find its balance.

So it 's just purging that.

So I do n't blame any being. I do n't blame the pyramids. I do n't blame that. If it if it is affected myself is because it 's only myself.

The one that should take care of that.

So do n't worry about that.

So another thing is about the offerings. People were asking about the best offer. I can make to someone to something whatever.

So I 'm not the one to say what is the best offer. Because offerings is about what you have to give. And what you want to receive. It 's not about.

A specific list of things that you have to give in order to. No , no , no , it 's not like that. It 's just. From your heart.

What are you willing to give?

Sometimes it 's just as mild. It 's just. Looking to them to just recognize that they are there. Just hot.

Energy. You. You will know how to do it.

So but it has to be from your heart. Really given it from you.

So if you have a list and you say , oh , yeah , I did. I did everything. I put the two scoops of honey. I am looking for the violet flower.

No , it 's not it 's not working like that.

Okay. It 's not like that. Another question that. That some people did to me.

It was about. Orion 's war that I was talking about Orion and the war between the galaxies on.

So they were asking so what what what happened why. If there is no good and bad and there there 's no demons. Why you explain about the war in Orion and the the the dark ones trying to get inside the system. And it does n't have any.

There. They 're not related. Basically. It 's not exactly the same.

It 's not exactly the same. That the system of darkness that I was trying to explain. It 's not related with the Orion 's war is another thing. It 's kind of related but not not directly.

Okay. We have to understand that even if for us the aliens seems like they know everything and they are.

So connected and so.

So great and so delighted. They are also aliens. They have their problems. They have their lives.

They have their their stuff.

So they have also wars.

Okay. In between their own dimensions and so on.

So what we have to understand that. We look into aliens the same way. Like dark look into us.

So for dogs we are all like great beings like gods like. Wow. They do all these crazy things that we have. No idea how they do it.

So we love them because they are like wow. And humans we have all this conflicts and all this. Problems.

So yeah.

So basically this about the dark ones. There is darkness in every dimension. Of course. There is darkness everywhere.

But only us in our reality have shaped the darkness in. Demons with animal shapes and so on.

So so this is our darkness. Another planets and other dimensions. They have their own way of the darkness. And they all have their own conflicts according to their own reality.

Okay.

So they have their conflicts. We have to solve ours. They have to solve theirs. Etc.

And that 's it.

Another thing to understand about this. That some people were telling me is about the cabal. A lot of people is explaining about the cabal. We can about cabal.

And I always like to explain the origin of these things.

So cabal. Its origin is cabal. And cabal is a tiny of the Torah. Is the study of the information behind the information behind the message of God according to the Hebrew tradition.

So it 's about philosophy and how to explain. It 's about philosophy and to explain how the universe is created , the concept of everything , etc. We have to remember that the Hebrew people were persecuted in Europe by the Christians for a long time because they had no country.

So they spread all around the world without a country.

So they had to survive. And they were so persecuted that they needed to make close schools.

So they were not killed.

So they created this cabalistic education. That was really , really difficult to understand.

So nobody would understand what they were.

So the Christians started to create the concept of al from the cabal to talk about people trying to take the power. And they relate these people with a Jewish.

So they started to create the idea of compete with the synonym of cabal.

Okay , this happened a few centuries ago.

So these two concepts are born from the same thing. But they are different in the use that they give to the world.

So in one hand , the cabalistic people are the people that study. That study , that study all information from God , from the Word of God , from the Torah , from the teachings of the Hebrew , the Jewish Judaism.

Okay , that 's one thing. And the other thing is what the Christians believed about them. That where people try to get control over the religion and so on.

So now we use the word cabal for the people that are trying to control the world.

Okay , but I would like to save this. We should not put all of them together in the same thing. Because if there are three or four all crazy guys that are trying to control the world and for some reason , a few of them are Jewish.

Okay , so it does n't mean that all the cabalistic people and the people that speak about cables and all these things , we are trying to go to the world or whatever.

Okay , it 's not always about conspiracy theories.

Okay , we are in the time with so much conspiracy that we missed the point of history. And we just put everyone in the same package. You know , and it 's not like that.

So there are some crazy guys trying to control the world.

Okay , yes. But it does n't mean that they all follow the cabalistic tradition.

Okay.

So if someone says that I am from the cabal , believe whatever you want to believe , I do n't care. I really do n't care.

So I love cabalistic. I never studied it , but I love it. I love when some people try to explain me about cables because it 's a really good knowledge.

So I 'm not going to just go against all cabalistic because three or four of them are trying to control the world somehow. I do n't know.

So it 's relaxed a little bit. And another thing that I was reading here is about illuminate. Illuminate is actually the same. We should not say the illuminate are trying to control the world.

That 's another conspiracy theory that it does n't work. The illuminate born in the 18th century. And they were all scientists trying to help us to think by ourselves. They created education , they created science , they created our mother science , they created their republics.

They tried to democracy again. Basically , the free press , everything that the illuminate did was created by them. Basically , all we have today is because of the illuminate. Because the illuminate in Italian means the lighted ones.

So they thought we are illustrated , the illuminated , the lighted means the illuminate. They knew the illustration , that 's how they call it.

So the process , the time of illustration between the 17th and the 18th century created this draw of our civilization.

So that three or four all crazy guys were trying to control everything and the society. Because they said , oh , if we are trying to educate the whole population , that would take a long time , so it 's better to control them.

So they would do whatever we want.

So those are three or four guys that they started this idea. But at the first time , it was not that. At the first time , they created everything that we have.

So we should not say all of them , this is the organization that are , no , no , no. It 's like saying , like , how would you feel if people say all the new age people are abroad and they are trying to just steal you , whatever.

So it 's not all of us , so it 's basically the same. It 's basically the same.

So speaking about the illuminate and all this people , we have to understand that when they said , no or those secular ones , they were not talking about , they were not talking about the conspiracy that they wanted to control everyone and everything. Otherwise , they would n't put it in one dollar bill. It 's like I want to hide everything. But I put it here so everyone can see it.

No , all well in Latin means the new world order.

Okay , and this is not something that before was something to hide. Before it was something to be proud of , they would say , yes , the maison , here we are , the maison , trying to bring you a new , imagine , this is exactly the same as we are trying to say now , it 's like we are here to work for the new world , for a new new team. And I say , we 're for a new humanity.

## Daily Practice Elements

Okay , so we are here for an even humanity. And imagine that we put that statement in Latin. It would be exactly the same. And basically , when they said about , when they said about noble or the secularism , they were talking about creating a new order of like , lysine in schools , education , for education for everyone , they were saying we are going to make republics , no more kingdoms and so on.

Okay , so it 's a lot of things that we have been defending these 200 years. We have been defending this , how to say , we have been defending this concepts that were from the Illumatic and the maison.

So what happened after that is that some of the Freemasons and some of the , of the Illumatic , they understood , they saw that we as citizens , we were irresponsible of our own life.

So what they just did was to organise something , some of them , not all of them , some of them to organize something from below so they could control and there you have a conspiracy. There you have a conspiracy , okay? Of these three , four crazy guys that try to organize everything from under the system. And yes , that 's true.

There are people doing that , of course. But what I want the point that I am trying to discuss here is that when we say Freemasons , when we say Illumatic , when we say , we are just putting all of them in the same bag and it 's not like that. It 's not like that. There are things that , it 's , for me it 's like saying that , like we can say , I do n't know , all Germans are Nazis.

Why? Why all Germans are Nazis?

So why? Everything that Germany has done before Hitler was back to.

So Gutenberg , the mentor of the , of the imprint , he does n't work it now because 500 years after that , there was a crazy guy. You know , so some of these things that we are living today and we call them conspiracies. They are just putting all the history in the same bag. When it is all about three or four guys , that are using the history in order to do their own things.

Okay , but it 's not like that. If we do n't like for other people to think that we are all the same , the same bad things of the new age.

So we should n't do exactly the same with others.

So the point of all this that I am willing to say is that we should not go against institutions and organizations. He should educate people. Our main goal is to educate people , not to go against people because when you fight , you give strength to the organizations. What you have to do is to understand that behind the organizations , there are only four or three old crazy guys that are just mistaken or whatever.

So we have to find the balance and teach educate much more than teaching.

So there is a moment behind all of this after these things that we find the English. We find the English because suddenly we see around and we just perceive that , oh , so this has been always like this everyone fighting everyone trying to change and the good ones fighting the bad ones , but all of them are mistaken. And so it 's gon na be constantly like this.

So it 's like meaningless. There 's no sense.

So people start to lose the meaning of everything.

So there 's where you find the English.

So English is the option that you feel when you ca n't understand the answer to what for? What for? Why to leave? Why to do all of this?

And which is not something that starts or begins from a cause or a purpose. It 's not related with something specific reality. It 's about everything. It 's about what is the meaning of everything.

Why is this like this? The English is like that emotion that all the other emotions and put them together.

So none of them can move. None of them know exactly where to go , where to move. And so there 's no meaning , the movement.

So English is not born from a war , from winning , watching a war. And which comes from not understanding the meaning of any. Why there is a war , why this , why that , why everything.

## Q&A

So basically the English is something that we all are going to experience during the process of acknowledging ourselves. Why are we living this reality? Why are we here? The existential questions are those related to the English.

So English basically born from the nonsense and we have spoken about this , that the nonsense , the ugly , is a state through where we can understand that our mind ourselves is the only one capable to give the meaning to the thing. The biggest nonsense which is the Irish is one that helps us to find the biggest meaning of everything which is love. The universe basically was created from love and the created finds the origin of universe through English. We may say that , oh , it 's so unfair.

It 's so horrible that we can only feel the unity by English , but we will recognize that in the experience in our lives , we all found the truth , the power of the divine , the process of awakening through a crisis , through English.

So , picture that , when we call English basically , is the conjunction of all the other emotions , we are so used to feel the emotions and to feel everything all constantly around so many movement in our life , that suddenly when English grabs them all and put them very tight in one point , stabilized , so no other emotion is moving around only here. There 's no movement , so you can not feel anything and we as humans interpret that stability as English.

So we are so used to feel , to perceive and feel emotions that when all the emotions stop like in a shock , like everything stops , we relate that moment with hand-wish.

So this is why English is basically a tool when we feel English. If we accomplish to go beyond the emotion of English , we will realize that that 's an opportunity to start again , to create something new.

So after I use the English as a tool to get to the creator , I realize myself that I am the creator.

So it 's in that moment when I become love. And by love , I start to expand. The new creation.

So here I want to say something about this emotions. We live in a society that was designed to be productive. Basically , we live in a society that everyone says that we have to work , that we have to work the fields , that we have to work in a factory , that we have to work in education , that we have to work in society , that we have to be useful for everyone. And in society , not today , but all the societies , if you are not working , you 're not useful.

So whoever is feeling sad , depressive with English , is not useful for society.

So basically , the unconscious of the society has designed a system so we perceive that to feel those emotions is not useful.

So it 's bad , so I have to avoid them. Otherwise , I 'm not productive. Basically , in our society , we all say , do n't cry. I do n't want to feel like this.

We have an addiction for the happiness of others and myself. Basically , it 's like an addiction , like sugar.

The reason why we do n't allow ourselves to leave the process of an emotion is because we feel unproductive.

So if we respect the time of that emotion and we see beyond the emotion itself , we can reach the reason why I 'm feeling that emotion. And there is how you can picture that you become more productive when you do that. When we are accomplished to create the situation of that produced language into the product 's description , we find the light. And the question would be , how can I do that?

So I would say each one knows how that you just have to pay attention.

So basically what we have to understand is how to become aware of our emotions.

So it 's not about to control emotions. If we feel sadness , if we feel anguish , we have to feel it. And we have to ask ourselves why I feel it and try to end the feeling. Because I have to become aware of why I feel it , why I feel it.

Not to how to get rid of it. One of the greatest mistakes that we usually do is to believe that we are here to try to control emotions. And we are not here to try to control them. We are here to understand them.

Why? To try to control emotions. It 's like trying to control another culture because you do n't understand their language. That 's not good.

## Daily Practice Elements

So basically you have to put awareness on why are you feeling what you feel? The vibration for today , been , been. The statement for today is I am the expansion of the being. The code for today is evolution.

The natural and biological law of evolution implies constant adaptation to the environment that it turning modifies itself. Even though we attribute to the natural world , it 's transverse to all dimensions for duty in systems cosmic change , all living and ethereal beings are forced to adapt to modify the realities.

So let 's go to the element.

So the last thing because I was watching some comments just to clarify this , what I am explaining here is not in emotions. It 's not to live away the language. It 's not to find a new time without an wish to live happily ever after. No , if I have been misunderstood with this , thinking that what I am doing is to help you to live happily , sorry , it 's not , it 's my mistake.

What I am just trying to do is to give you tools to understand how to create your own realities.

So what you do with that is your thing. If you use all this to become happy , so good for you. If you do all this and take all this to clean your language from your life , good for you. If you take all this to create a new world , good for you.

So it 's all how you use it. It 's not about my intention on how you will use it.

Okay? That would be.

So be free.

So relax , see it comfortable. I move my shoulders and circles to relax the weight of the body. And our relax letting all the weight of the body fall down. I focus only in my breathing.

I feel the light around me , touching the skin , and getting inside my bones , organs , muscles , and muscles. I feel the brightest of all my being , shining outside and inside. I recognize myself. I am.

## Energy Work

I am the higher self that descends to my body. I am the higher self that descends to my body. Take a deep breath and perceive how you get inside the crown. Going through their eye , throat , heart , flees , scrum , root , knees , and ankles.

I manifest my intention to go to my wish. I think the concert of love. I manifest my intention to go to my wish.

So then concert of love. I recognize the earth as the anguish. I have to transcend to go through. And I go for it.

I perceive myself going through my feet to the soil , the ground , the roots , stones , and rocks. Going through all the class of the world. I perceive the heat , the embrace of the fire , through the magma , feeling the pressure. Going faster and faster towards the core , the iron of the planet.

I feel the pressure on me of the whole planet. I feel so much that I feel nothing. What is your biggest anguish in your life? Be aware of that anguish and bring it to you.

Be aware of it. And recognize it for it is your tool. To find the love , the purpose. I perceive.

I perceive. I perceive. I am the expansion of the being. I am the expansion of the being.

I am the expansion of the being. And this , in this expansion , where I find the meaning. I perceive. From the light we come.

From the light we are. And we hold your zeros. And we hold your zeros. Our light.

This in your hands. Our light. This in your feet. For the light.

This your responsibility. Of what you do. With your hands. And where you go.

With your feet. Your zeros. This is your responsibility. It 's just a moment.

When you stand still. To think. What you do. And where you go.

We are not here. To take away your zeros. We are here. To hug you.

Well done. Be free. We are here. Take your breath.

And take all this awareness. Through your body. Like raising. Stretching.

And joining. Coming back here.

Now. Open your eyes. Drive. Learn.

That was designed. Alright Albacete. All right. Yours.

Pick 1 character in the edge and finish with the base and put it back into the zone. It is a perfect starting position. There. It 's time.

There. There. There. Thank you for your advice for being there.

So , as always , it 's a moral at the same time and pay attention to your dreams. Goodbye , it 's moral.
