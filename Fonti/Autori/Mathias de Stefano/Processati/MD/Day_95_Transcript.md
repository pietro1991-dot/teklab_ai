# Day 95 - Anguish: The Meeting Point of All Emotions

## Daily Practice Elements

**Vibration**: BEN  
**Statement**: "I am the expansion of the being"  
**Chakra**: Root Chakra  
**Law**: Law of Evolution - The natural and biological law of evolution implies constant adaptation to the environment that in turn modifies itself. Even though we attribute it to the natural world, it's transverse to all dimensions. For duty in systems cosmic change, all living and ethereal beings are forced to adapt to modify the realities.

## Overview

Anguish is not born from a single cause or specific reality—it is the emotion that emerges when all other emotions gather together in one point, so tightly compressed that none of them can move. It is the existential crisis that asks: "What for? Why live? Why all of this?" Anguish comes from not understanding the answer to the meaning of everything, the ultimate "why?" that transcends any specific situation. When we are so accustomed to feeling emotions constantly moving through us, the sudden stillness when all emotions stop—like in a shock—is what we interpret as anguish. This stabilization of all emotion into one unmoving point feels like emptiness, like meaninglessness.

Yet anguish is actually a powerful tool. If we can move beyond the emotion of anguish itself, we realize it is an opportunity to start again, to create something new. After we use anguish as a tool to reach the creator within, we recognize ourselves as the creator, and in that moment, we become love. From love, we begin to expand into new creation. We live in a society designed for productivity, where anyone feeling sadness, depression, or anguish is seen as not useful. Our unconscious has been trained to perceive these emotions as bad, something to avoid. But when we respect the time of an emotion and see beyond the emotion itself, we reach the reason why we feel it—and that is where true productivity begins.

Understanding anguish also requires clarifying historical distortions. The Orion war involved conflicts between dimensions, but it is separate from the darkness we work with on Earth. Aliens have their own problems and wars—they are not gods. The cabal originally referred to the Kabbalah, the study of divine information in Hebrew tradition, but Christians persecuted Jews and twisted the word to mean people trying to control power. Similarly, the Illuminati were 18th-century scientists who created education, science, democracy, and free press—the foundation of modern civilization. A few individuals later used these organizations for control, but we should not blame entire traditions or groups for the actions of a few. This kind of blanket condemnation is the same prejudice we reject in other contexts.

## Core Teaching

### The Nature of Anguish

Anguish is the emotion that appears when you can't understand the answer to "what for?"—the purpose behind existence itself. It's not related to something specific in reality but to everything: the meaning of all of it. Anguish is like all other emotions putting themselves together so tightly that none of them can move, none of them know where to go. There's no meaning in the movement. This emotion is not born from a war or from winning or watching conflict—it comes from not understanding the meaning of why there is war, why this, why that, why everything. The existential questions—Why are we living this reality? Why are we here?—these are related to anguish.

### Anguish as a Tool for Awakening

Anguish is born from nonsense, and we have spoken before about how nonsense—the ugly, the meaningless—is a state through which we understand that our mind, our self, is the only one capable of giving meaning to things. The biggest nonsense, which is anguish, is what helps us find the biggest meaning of everything, which is love. The universe was created from love, and the created finds the origin of the universe through anguish. We may say it's unfair and horrible that we can only feel unity through anguish, but in our life experience, we all found the truth, the power of the divine, the process of awakening, through a crisis, through anguish. When all emotions stop in shock, everything stabilizes, and if we accomplish to go beyond the emotion itself, we realize that moment is an opportunity to start again, to create something new. After using anguish as a tool to reach the creator, we realize we are the creator, and in that moment we become love and start to expand new creation.

### Society's Relationship with Emotions

We live in a society designed to be productive. Everyone says we have to work—in the fields, in factories, in education, in society—we have to be useful for everyone. In all societies, if you are not working, you are not useful. Whoever is feeling sad, depressive, or with anguish is not useful for society. The unconscious of society has designed a system where we perceive that feeling those emotions is not useful, so it's bad, so we have to avoid them. Otherwise, we're not productive. In our society, we all say "don't cry," "I don't want to feel like this." We have an addiction to happiness—for others and for ourselves. It's like an addiction to sugar. The reason we don't allow ourselves to live the process of an emotion is because we feel unproductive. But if we respect the time of that emotion and see beyond the emotion itself, we can reach the reason why we're feeling it. That's how we become more productive—when we transform the unproductive anguish into productive description, we find the light.

### Clarifying Orion, Cabal, and Illuminati

Many people ask about the Orion war and wonder how it relates to the teaching that there is no good and bad, no demons. These are not directly related. Even if aliens seem to know everything and be so connected and enlightened, they are also aliens—they have their problems, their lives, their stuff. They have wars between their own dimensions. Dogs look at us as great beings, like gods, amazed at what we do, yet we humans have all our conflicts and problems. Similarly, there is darkness in every dimension, of course. But only we in our reality have shaped darkness into demons with animal forms. This is our darkness. Other planets and dimensions have their own way of darkness and their own conflicts according to their reality. They have to solve theirs; we have to solve ours.

Regarding the cabal: its origin is Kabbalah, a study of the Torah, the information behind the information of God according to Hebrew tradition. It's about philosophy and explaining how the universe is created. Hebrew people were persecuted in Europe by Christians for a long time because they had no country. They created cabalistic education that was difficult to understand so they wouldn't be killed. Christians started to create the concept of "cabal" to talk about people trying to take power and related them with Jews. This created the idea of conspiracy with the word cabal. Now we use "cabal" for people trying to control the world, but we should not put everyone together in the same package. There are some crazy people trying to control the world, yes, but it doesn't mean all cabalistic people or those who study Kabbalah are trying to rule the world.

The Illuminati were born in the 18th century—scientists trying to help us think by ourselves. They created education, science, democracy, republics, free press. Everything we have today is because of the Illuminati. "Illuminati" in Italian means "the lighted ones"—the illustrated, the enlightened. The time of illustration between the 17th and 18th centuries created the foundation of our civilization. Three or four people later said, "If we're trying to educate the whole population, that takes a long time, so it's better to control them." Those few started this idea of conspiracy. But at first, the Illuminati created everything we value. We shouldn't say all of them are part of an evil organization. How would you feel if people said all New Age people are frauds trying to steal from you? It's not all of us, and it's the same principle.

### The Real Point: Education Over Fighting

We should not go against institutions and organizations. Our main goal is to educate people, not to fight them, because when you fight, you give strength to the organizations. Behind the organizations, there are only three or four people who are mistaken or misguided. We have to find balance and educate much more than fight. When we look around and perceive that everyone is fighting everyone, the good ones fighting the bad ones, but all of them are mistaken, and it's constantly like this—it seems meaningless. There's no sense. People start to lose the meaning of everything. That's where anguish appears. The only solution is to understand that behind all this, we find anguish because we see the futility of endless conflict. The answer is to stop blaming institutions and start taking responsibility for educating ourselves and others.

### Becoming Aware of Emotions

It's not about controlling emotions. If we feel sadness, if we feel anguish, we have to feel it. We have to ask ourselves why we feel it and try to understand the feeling—not how to get rid of it. One of the greatest mistakes we usually make is believing we are here to control emotions. We are not here to control them; we are here to understand them. Trying to control emotions is like trying to control another culture because you don't understand their language—that's not good. We have to put awareness on why we are feeling what we feel. This practice is not about living without anguish or finding a new time without anguish to live happily ever after. What Matias is explaining is not emotions-free living; it's giving you tools to understand how to create your own realities. What you do with that is your thing. If you use this to become happy, good for you. If you use this to clean anguish from your life, good for you. If you take this to create a new world, good for you. It's all about how you use it—be free.

## Practice

The meditation today takes you to the core of your being to ask your subconscious and the darkness within to reveal the source of your anguish, so you may transform it.

**Preparation**: Sit comfortably. Move your shoulders in circles to relax the weight of the body. Let all the weight fall down, focus only on your breathing. Feel the light around you touching your skin and getting inside your bones, organs, and muscles. Feel the brightness of all your being, shining outside and inside.

**Descent of the I Am**: Recognize yourself as the I Am, the higher self that descends to your body. Take a deep breath and perceive how you descend inside through the crown, going through third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacrum, root, knees, and ankles.

**Setting the Intention**: Manifest your intention to go to your anguish. Think of the concept of love—not romantic love, but the existential meaning, the eternal energy that allows all other emotions to exist.

**Journey to the Core**: Descend from your feet toward the ground, going deeper through the crust of the world, roots, and stones, rocks. Continue going out from the crust, heading toward the nucleus through the magma, feeling its heat and pressure.

**Meeting the Questions**: As you turn faster toward the core of iron at the heart of Earth, recognize in the core of the world all the questions that create your life: Who? Why? What for? Where? When? All these questions you ask yourself. Don't expect any answer—just recognize them as the tools from confusion to find information. Feel the pressure of all the questions of your existence.

**Vibration**: Calibrate the questions with your vibration. Repeat the sound **BEN** from deep within.

**Statement**: Repeat: "I am the expansion of the being. I am the expansion of the being. I am the expansion of the being."

**Return**: Slowly bring your awareness back through the layers of Earth, rising through the magma, the crust, and back into your body. Take a deep breath and stretch your body. Open your eyes when ready.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Tonight before sleep, take five minutes to sit with any anguish, sadness, or heavy emotion you've been avoiding. Don't try to fix it or make it go away. Instead, ask it: "Why are you here? What are you trying to teach me?" Write down whatever arises. Remember, anguish is all your emotions compressed into one unmoving point—if you can see beyond the emotion, you'll find the opportunity to create something entirely new.

### Applying the Wisdom

Throughout your day, when you encounter sadness or confusion or the feeling that something is meaningless, resist the urge to immediately distract yourself or "be productive." Give yourself permission to feel the emotion for a few minutes. Ask: "What is the existential question behind this feeling?" Often anguish hides questions like "Am I living my purpose?" or "Does any of this matter?" These questions, when faced honestly, lead you to recognize you are the one who gives meaning—you are the creator. This is the transformation from anguish to awakening.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What exactly is anguish, and why does it feel so heavy?**  
A: Anguish is the emotion that appears when all other emotions gather together so tightly in one point that none of them can move. We are so used to emotions moving constantly through us that when they all stop—like in a shock—we interpret that stillness as anguish. It feels heavy because it's actually all your emotions compressed, stabilized, with no movement. We relate that moment of complete stillness to meaninglessness, to emptiness.

**Q: How can anguish be a tool if it feels so terrible?**  
A: If you can move beyond the emotion of anguish itself—if you don't get stuck in the feeling but look at what it's showing you—you realize it's an opportunity to start again, to create something new. After you use anguish as a tool to get to the creator within, you realize you are the creator. In that moment, you become love, and from love you start to expand new creation. We all found the truth, the power of the divine, the process of awakening, through a crisis, through anguish.

**Q: Why does society make us feel bad about emotions like sadness and anguish?**  
A: We live in a society designed to be productive. If you're not working, you're not useful. Whoever is feeling sad, depressive, or with anguish is not useful for society, so the unconscious of society has designed a system where we perceive those emotions as bad, something to avoid. We have an addiction to happiness—for others and ourselves—like an addiction to sugar. But when we respect the time of an emotion and see beyond it, we can reach the reason why we're feeling it, and that's where we become truly productive.

**Q: Are we supposed to control our emotions or just let them happen?**  
A: We are not here to control emotions but to understand them. Trying to control emotions is like trying to control another culture because you don't understand their language—that's not good. If we feel sadness or anguish, we have to feel it. We have to ask ourselves why we feel it and try to understand the feeling—not how to get rid of it. Put awareness on why you are feeling what you feel. That's the practice.

**Q: How does the Orion war relate to darkness and demons on Earth?**  
A: They are not directly related. Even aliens have their problems, their lives, their conflicts. They have wars between their own dimensions. There is darkness in every dimension, but only we in our reality have shaped darkness into demons with animal forms. This is our darkness. Other planets and dimensions have their own way of darkness and their own conflicts according to their reality. They solve theirs; we solve ours.

**Q: What is the truth about the cabal and Illuminati?**  
A: The cabal originates from Kabbalah, the Hebrew study of the Torah and divine information—philosophy explaining how the universe is created. Christians persecuted Jews and twisted the word to mean people trying to control power. Now "cabal" is used for people trying to control the world, but we shouldn't put all cabalistic people in the same bag. The Illuminati were 18th-century scientists who created education, science, democracy, free press—the foundation of our civilization. A few people later used these structures for control, but we shouldn't condemn entire traditions for the actions of a few. It's like saying all New Age people are frauds.

**Q: So should we fight against these conspiracies or not?**  
A: No. We should not go against institutions and organizations. Our main goal is to educate people, not fight, because when you fight, you give strength to the organizations. Behind the organizations, there are only three or four people who are mistaken. We have to find balance and educate much more than fight. When everyone is fighting everyone—good ones fighting bad ones, all of them mistaken—that's when anguish appears, because we see it's meaningless. The solution is responsibility and education, not more conflict.

**Q: What is the real purpose of this teaching—to make us happy?**  
A: No. This teaching is not about living without anguish or finding a new time to live happily ever after. It's about giving you tools to understand how to create your own realities. What you do with that is your thing. If you use this to become happy, good. If you use this to clean anguish from your life, good. If you take this to create a new world, good. It's all about how you use it. Be free. The teaching gives you freedom through understanding, not a prescription for happiness.
