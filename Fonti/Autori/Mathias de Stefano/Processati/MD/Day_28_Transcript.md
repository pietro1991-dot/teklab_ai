## Overview

Welcome to Day 28, where we work with the knees—the part of our body that encodes all the mistakes, guilt, and blame from our personal history and our ancestral lineage. This is perhaps the most challenging teaching in the entire series, asking us to radically transform our understanding of guilt, blame, judgment, and what it means to be a "bad person."

The knees represent the path, everything we have done, everywhere we have walked. In our energetic anatomy, the knees store the encoding of our history—all the choices we've made, all the mistakes we've committed, all the things we feel guilty about, and all the things others have done that we blame them for.

Today's teaching challenges us to see guilt and blame from a higher perspective. From the spiritual level, guilt is simply unconsciousness—not knowing, being ignorant of the consequences or better choices. Everyone who does something "bad" does it from a state of not knowing, not being aware, not understanding. Even the worst people in history were, from a spiritual perspective, simply children who didn't know how to act properly, who were hurt and distorted, who hadn't learned yet.

This teaching is not about condoning harm or allowing abuse. It's about understanding that from the level of spirit and soul, there is only the learning process. No one is evil—some are just more distorted, more hurt, more unconscious than others. And the path to healing the past (both personal and ancestral) is not through more judgment and blame, but through understanding, compassion, and taking responsibility for releasing the burden of guilt from ourselves and from all those whose history lives within us.

## Core Teaching

### The Knees: Repository of History and Path

The knees are the joints that allow us to walk, to move forward on our path, to bend and adapt as we navigate the terrain of life. Energetically and symbolically, they represent our history, our journey, the path we have walked.

The teaching states: "The knees represent the path, represents everything that we have done." All the mistakes in our history are encoded in the knees. This is why the knees are related not only to feeling guilty ourselves but also to pointing to someone else as guilty—both dynamics are stored here.

When we talk about the knees and guilt being related to the past, it makes sense: "When we think about the bad things that we did, we usually take a look backwards in our history. We see the things that we have done, and somehow we say, 'From here, I wouldn't do it that way. I would have done it in a different way.' Now I have tools to do it differently."

The knees hold the weight of our history—both our personal history and our ancestral history. They bend under the burden of guilt and shame. When guilt is heavy and unresolved, knee problems often develop. The knees literally buckle under the weight of what we're carrying from the past.

### Guilt Is Unconsciousness

One of the most important shifts in perspective offered by this teaching is understanding guilt as unconsciousness rather than as moral failing.

"When we see backwards, our position from the present makes us look at that in the past, we didn't have the tools to solve the problem or to answer in a proper way. What we are doing is realizing that in that moment, I had no idea how to do the stuff properly. I was ignorant."

**To be ignorant simply means you don't know something.** We are all ignorant in some way. We are all learning. The process is to make mistakes while we do mistakes, we learn. It's the common process to ignore some stuff.

From this perspective, guilt transforms into recognizing: "I didn't know then what I know now. I didn't have the awareness, the tools, the understanding I have now. I was unconscious of the consequences or the better choice."

The same applies to those we blame: "That person had no idea about how to be aware or become conscious about the fact." They weren't consciously choosing evil—they were unconscious, unaware, ignorant of better ways.

This doesn't excuse the harm done. But it changes our relationship to it. Instead of moral judgment (good person vs. bad person), we see it as a learning process (conscious vs. unconscious, aware vs. unaware, having tools vs. lacking tools).

### The Spiritual Perspective: Everyone Is Learning

From the level of spirit and soul, the only thing that exists is the learning process. The spiritual mind doesn't see guilty people, enemies, or bad people. "They see all kids trying to learn."

The teaching gives a powerful metaphor: imagine you are two humans fighting. From your perspective, this person is your enemy, really bad, someone you judge harshly. But now picture that you are in a kindergarten. You had an enemy there—a little kid who grabbed your hair or threw sand in your face. From your child perspective, that was your enemy.

But from the point of view of the teachers and parents (another level of consciousness), it was just a child who had no idea how to make a relationship. The child needed to learn how to handle information, how to handle relationships with others.

"Now come back again to the picture of two humans fighting. You feel this one is your enemy, it's like a really bad person. **From the point of view of the masters in another level, it's just two kids fighting.** None of them know really how to act properly. They are in the process of learning."

This is the spiritual perspective. From higher consciousness, we are all children learning. Some are more advanced in their learning than others. Some are more distorted or hurt and therefore acting out in more harmful ways. But no one is inherently evil—they are just at different stages of consciousness and learning.

### The Question of "Bad People": The Example of Hitler

The teaching directly addresses the hardest question: what about truly terrible people? What about someone like Hitler?

The answer is not to condone what was done, but to understand: "When we see the result of Hitler, we have to go back to the past and see that he was a kid who was trying to be an artist, painting, trying to act in theater. Nobody trusted him. Everyone was trying to make him like the worst—'You're not good for this, you're not good for that, you cannot do this, you have to do another things.'"

He was a frustrated artist. And he became a distortion of himself.

"Every time that you see a bad person in history or right now, you just have to picture they were kids really hurt. Always kids really hurt."

**This is the key to compassion:** understanding that every person who does terrible things was a child who was hurt, who didn't have the tools, who became distorted through suffering and unconsciousness.

Compassion doesn't mean "that's okay" or "there shouldn't be consequences." Compassion means understanding the process, understanding how someone got to where they are, seeing the hurt child inside even the most distorted adult.

"When you picture bad people, you just see the kid hurting inside. Compassion is to understand that that person was just trying to do what that person could understand about reality."

### The Paradox: Understanding Without Condoning

This teaching sits in a difficult paradox that many people struggle with: How do we understand and have compassion for people who have done terrible things, without condoning what they did or allowing it to continue?

The teaching addresses this: "I know that there are a lot of people saying, 'Examples like this person and this person?' Yes. Even them. Everyone. Everyone."

It breaks with conventional ethics and morality. It's "one of the most heavy and difficult processes" because it requires us to see from a perspective that transcends our human need for justice and judgment.

But here's the crucial point: **"If you are trying to enlighten yourself, to go into another level of consciousness, you have to transform that feeling, that emotion."**

The person you blame, the one you think is guilty—they don't have the guilt, the pain, the rancor. You do. You are the one carrying it. And if you want to be free, if you want to reach higher consciousness, you have to release it.

"It's just for you. It's just for your own release. It's just for your own freedom."

This is not about letting the other person off the hook. It's about freeing yourself from the burden of carrying blame and resentment.

### Forgiveness: The Teaching of Jesus

The teaching references Jesus on the cross: "Forgive them, for they don't know what they do."

This is the essence of the spiritual understanding of guilt and forgiveness. Even those who are killing him—they don't know. They are unconscious. They don't understand the reality of what they're doing.

Forgiveness is recognizing unconsciousness and choosing to release the energy of blame and judgment that we hold.

### Forget vs. Forgive: The Linguistic Wisdom

An important distinction is made between forgive and forget. In Spanish, "forget" comes from ancient language meaning "to sleep," "to slip," "to fall down again." For English, the teaching suggests: "Forget is like holding again, as forgive is giving away."

**We should not forget.** If we forget, we will fall into the same pattern again.

What we must do is remember without rancor, without resentment, without being trapped in the emotion.

"What we have to do is to face the problem, to acknowledge the problem, to go over the problem, to see things from a different perspective. Not to forget."

We remember the history—what happened, what we did, what was done to us—but we transform our relationship to it. We see it from a higher perspective, we understand the unconsciousness involved, we extract the learning, and we release the emotional charge.

### Transforming Pain into Compassion

Someone asked: "Do I transform pain into compassion?" The teaching clarifies the process.

Pain is "a joint of all the energies and emotions that has been stuck in a part of my body." By being stuck, there's no transformation—the energy isn't moving.

Transformation is a long process: "To understand, to face the conflict, to face the problem, the emotions, to put myself in another position, to watch it from another perspective, to make a new meaning, give a new meaning to what happened, to give a purpose to what happened."

"What happened, I cannot change it. What I have to do is to give a purpose to it."

This is how pain transforms into compassion—not by forcing it, not overnight, but through the process of understanding, shifting perspective, finding meaning and purpose in what happened, and allowing the stuck energy to move.

"Compassion is not something that you practice. Compassion is something that you just feel. It just happens through the process of understanding, of becoming aware of why things happen."

### Creating a New Civilization: Releasing the Concept of Bad People

One of the most powerful visions in this teaching is about healing the future through how we educate children.

We must stop teaching kids that there are good people and bad people, that bad people must be judged and good people must be prized.

"One of the ways in which we can heal this process through the future is to stop teaching the kids that they are good people and bad people, that the bad people must be judged and the good people must be priced."

Instead, we need to show children everything that happened in history—don't hide the bad things, don't shut up about suffering and mistakes. But give them a new perspective:

"Those people that did a really bad history were also kids like you one day. They were hurt. They had no friends. Their parents didn't love them. They ended up doing these things because they don't have the correct friends to teach them, to be loved."

This is how we change the perception and heal history through the future—not by hiding the darkness, but by teaching a compassionate understanding of how darkness arises from unconsciousness and hurt.

"Otherwise, if we just picture a beautiful future for the kids and we don't tell them the truth, how can they solve their own problems? They are going to screw it up again."

We heal the cycle by teaching true understanding rather than perpetuating judgment and blame.

### Ancestral Guilt and the Knees

The teaching emphasizes that the knees hold not only our own guilt but ancestral guilt. "I recognize that inside of them I can find all the pain, not only from my history but also the one from my ancestors."

Everything that is heavy, that doesn't allow us to move forward, that keeps us thinking on the past—this is stuck in the knees.

The statement "I Am the Path of My Ancestors" recognizes that we carry our lineage within us. All that our ancestors lived, all their mistakes and guilt, lives within us. And it is only we who can release everyone—ourselves, our ancestors, and the future—from this heavy burden.

This is powerful work: healing not just your own guilt, but the guilt and shame carried through your family line, potentially for generations.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably and prepare your body with gentle stretching and movement. Pay special attention to your knees—bend them, straighten them, notice how they feel. Are they stiff? Painful? Tight? This may indicate stuck energy related to guilt and past burdens.

Touch and massage your legs, especially your knees—the upper part, the lower part, the front, the back. Recognize each corner of your knees.

Set the intention to release guilt, to transform your understanding of blame, to see from a spiritual perspective, and to free yourself and your ancestors from the burden of the past.

### Main Practice: Releasing Guilt from the Path

**Step 1:** Focus on your breathing and relax your body deeply with each breath. Bring oxygen to your lungs, heart, blood, organs, muscles.

**Step 2:** Feel the heat inside your body going outside through your skin, filling up your aura and magnetic field. Picture the emotional level (moon light, fresh) and the spiritual mental level (sun light, warm) around you.

**Step 3:** Recognize your body as the temple that your spirit and soul inhabits. Your legs are the two paths that bring everything to your temple.

**Step 4:** Touch and caress your legs, especially your knees. Recognize that inside of them you can find all the pain—not only from your history but also from your ancestors. Everything that is heavy, that is not allowing you to move forward, that keeps you thinking on the past—it's stuck in your knees.

**Step 5:** Picture in front of you all these situations that push you back to the past, all the situations that are not allowing you to move forward. Picture every situation where you feel guilty. Picture every situation where you feel others are guilty. Take a moment to think about these facts, these people.

**Step 6:** Take a deep breath. Without judgment or fear, just observe. Relax your arms and hands.

**Step 7:** Picture your temple (your whole body). Realize that the two legs represent the two paths that bring everything to your temple. Everything you feel within has arrived through these two paths.

**Step 8:** Recognize that "each guilty person, each sinner, everyone that has made a mistake while unconscious, has reached my temple coming through my door, through the hall, to ask for forgiveness, coming through these two paths."

Everything that has reached your temple has come through the legs, through your history, to ask for forgiveness, for freedom. It is only yourself who is able to bring clarity, forgiveness, and release the heavy weight from these two paths.

**Step 9:** Start to allow the light of your awareness and consciousness to come inside your temple through the crown, through the eyes, through the throat, through the heart, through the solar plexus, through the sacrum, to the door at the genitals.

**Step 10:** Take a deep breath and allow yourself to open the doors. Bring the light of the I Am towards these two paths (your legs and knees).

**Step 11:** Recognize: "It is only myself, the one able to release the feeling of guilt of myself and the perception of guilty among others, realizing that everyone are just learning in the process of life."

**Step 12:** Begin to pronounce the sound "Su" (like "sue" or "soo") to enlighten every lamp, the light of the stream in each path. Chant "Su" multiple times: "Su, Su, Su, Su, Su, Su..."

**Step 13:** Say to yourself: "I can release myself from guilt. I can release others from guilt. I can be compassionate." Continue chanting: "Su, Su..."

**Step 14:** Recognize: "I recognize that it's a long path to reach compassion, but it's in my will, my intention, to take the first step ahead." Or don't—it's your choice. But acknowledge where you are honestly.

**Step 15:** Bring your hands with the tips of your fingers to each one of your knees. Take a deep breath and bring consciousness, delight, becoming aware that everything you have lived was in relation to the perspective and the tools that you had in that moment.

**Step 16:** Recognize: "I cannot judge myself for not having the tools in the right moment. I recognize that I cannot judge others for being unconscious, for not knowing what they do."

**Step 17:** Take a deep breath and recognize the power within you. Start to make the knees shine brighter and brighter as you recognize: "I bring clarity to my history, to my personal path, and to the history of all the people that lives within me."

**Step 18:** "I recognize that myself right here and now on the path to heal my whole history, to heal and release the history for the future."

**Step 19:** Bring the light and repeat: "I Am the Path of My Ancestors. I Am the Path of My Ancestors. I Am the Path of My Ancestors. I Am the Path of My Ancestors."

**Step 20:** Take your hands to your chest. "All the ancestors integrate within me. Everything that they have lived in their history and I have lived in my history lives within me. It is only me, the one able to release everyone—myself, the ancestors, and the future—from this heavy burden."

**Step 21:** "I say: I can set myself free from guilt. I can be compassive, for I Am the Path of My Ancestors."

**Step 22:** Take a deep breath and bring all the awareness from your heart to each part of your body. Caress, massage, stretch, yawn. Come back to full presence and open your eyes.

### Closing

After the meditation, take a long walk if possible. The walking practice is particularly powerful for this work.

As you walk, think: your left knee is your mother, your right knee is your father. As you walk, remember while walking a situation of guilt—even if it's from your side or from their side. Just picture one situation, not many. Just one for each parent.

Think about it while walking. Try to feel—as the knees are moving, where do you feel pain? Just be aware of that. You're not trying to fix it—just moving, releasing the tension of what you are thinking.

Journal about your experience. What guilt are you carrying? What blame are you holding onto? Can you see the unconsciousness (yours or others') underneath the guilt? Can you take even a small step toward understanding rather than judgment?

If you feel heavy or bad after this work, walk barefoot in grass if possible, or lie down. Drink a lot of water. Rest. This is deep ancestral and karmic work—honor the heaviness that may arise and give yourself space to integrate.

## Integration

This is perhaps the most challenging teaching to integrate because it requires us to release our attachment to judgment, blame, and the concept of "bad people"—which are deeply ingrained in human consciousness and society.

Start small. You don't have to immediately feel compassion for the worst people in history. Start with yourself. Can you look at your own past mistakes with understanding rather than harsh judgment? Can you see that you were doing the best you could with the tools and awareness you had at the time?

Then extend to people close to you who have hurt you in smaller ways. Can you see their unconsciousness? Can you understand what hurt or lack of tools led them to act as they did? Can you hold both truths: what they did was harmful AND they were unconscious/unaware?

Practice the walking meditation. This is powerful for releasing stuck energy from the knees and from ancestral patterns. Walk regularly and consciously, feeling your knees moving, releasing the weight of history with each step.

Pay attention to your knees physically. If you have knee pain or problems, explore what guilt or blame you might be carrying. Along with appropriate physical care, work energetically and emotionally with releasing the burden.

Examine how you talk about and think about people who have done wrong. Can you shift from "bad person" to "unconscious person"? From "evil" to "deeply hurt and distorted"? This doesn't mean condoning harm—it means understanding how harm arises.

Work with ancestral healing. You carry patterns from your parents, grandparents, and further back. Some of the guilt and shame you feel may not even be yours originally—it may be inherited. Acknowledge your ancestors, understand what they went through, and consciously choose to release the burden you've been carrying for them.

Remember: this work is for your freedom, not for anyone else. Releasing guilt and blame doesn't change the past or let others "off the hook"—it frees YOU from being trapped in the past.

## Q&A

**Q: Doesn't this teaching let people off the hook for terrible things they've done?**

**A:** No. Understanding that someone acted from unconsciousness doesn't mean there shouldn't be consequences for harmful actions. Society still needs justice systems, boundaries, and accountability. This teaching is about your internal relationship to guilt and blame, about freeing yourself from the poison of resentment, about seeing from a spiritual perspective. You can hold someone accountable for their actions AND understand they were unconscious. These are not mutually exclusive. The teaching is about your consciousness and freedom, not about societal justice.

**Q: What if I was deeply harmed? Isn't this teaching asking me to excuse my abuser?**

**A:** No. This teaching is never about excusing abuse or harm. It's about your healing and freedom. The person who harmed you may have been unconscious, hurt, lacking tools—but that doesn't make what they did okay, and you absolutely should have boundaries and protection from further harm. This teaching is offering you a path to release the burden of carrying resentment and blame, which is poisoning YOU, not them. You can understand they were unconscious AND maintain firm boundaries. You can have compassion for the hurt child they once were AND refuse to allow them access to you now. Compassion and boundaries are not contradictory.

**Q: How can I forgive when the person hasn't even acknowledged what they did or apologized?**

**A:** Forgiveness in this teaching is not about the other person—it's about you releasing the stuck energy of blame and resentment from your body. It doesn't require the other person to apologize, change, or even be alive. It's entirely an internal process. You're not saying "what you did was okay." You're saying "I'm choosing to release the poison of resentment from my system because it's harming me, not you." This is forgiveness as self-liberation, not as reconciliation. You can forgive (release the energy) and still maintain complete distance and boundaries from the person.

**Q: What's the difference between compassion and being a doormat?**

**A:** Compassion is understanding—seeing clearly how unconsciousness creates harm. Being a doormat is allowing yourself to be harmed because you don't value yourself or can't set boundaries. Compassion can coexist with extremely firm boundaries. In fact, true compassion often requires boundaries—you can understand that someone is acting from unconsciousness AND refuse to allow them to harm you or others. You can see the hurt child inside them AND protect yourself and others from their current harmful behavior. Compassion doesn't mean letting people walk all over you—it means seeing clearly while protecting what's sacred.

**Q: I can intellectually understand this teaching but I still feel angry and resentful. What do I do?**

**A:** This is completely normal and honest. The teaching explicitly says this is "a long path" and transformation doesn't happen overnight. Don't force yourself to feel something you don't feel. Start where you are: "I understand intellectually that this person was unconscious, but I still feel angry, and that's where I am right now." Acknowledge the anger honestly. Feel it in your body. Let it move. Understanding is the first step, but the emotional and energetic release is a process that takes time and often requires additional support (therapy, somatic work, energy healing). Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you would be with anyone in the learning process.

**Q: What if I'm the one who did something terrible? How do I live with that guilt?**

**A:** Apply this teaching to yourself. You acted from unconsciousness—from the tools and awareness you had at that moment. This doesn't excuse what you did, but it helps you understand it. You weren't trying to create harm; you were unconscious of the full reality and consequences. Now you are more conscious. What you can do now is: acknowledge fully what you did and the harm it caused, make amends where possible, change your behavior going forward, and release the self-judgment that keeps you stuck in the past. Guilt that leads to change and making amends is useful. Guilt that just tortures you and keeps you paralyzed is not useful to anyone—not to you, not to those you harmed. Free yourself to become more conscious and act better.

**Q: How is this different from spiritual bypassing?**

**A:** Spiritual bypassing is using spiritual concepts to avoid dealing with painful realities and emotions. This teaching is not about avoiding—it's explicitly about facing. "What we have to do is to face the problem, to acknowledge the problem, to go over the problem." The difference is that after facing it fully, we also shift our perspective to see it from a higher consciousness. We don't skip the pain—we move through it to understanding. True compassion arises after fully acknowledging the harm, not by pretending it wasn't harmful. If you're using this teaching to avoid feeling your anger or pain, that's bypassing. If you're feeling your anger and pain fully AND THEN also working toward understanding and compassion, that's genuine spiritual work.

**Q: What about justice? Doesn't society need to punish wrongdoing?**

**A:** This teaching is about consciousness and spiritual perspective, not about social policy. Society may well need justice systems, consequences for harmful actions, and structures that protect people from harm. These can coexist with a compassionate understanding of unconsciousness. We can have systems that hold people accountable while also recognizing they are human beings in the process of learning. The goal of such systems might shift from pure punishment to accountability, protection of society, and rehabilitation where possible. But this teaching is primarily about your personal consciousness and freedom from the burden of guilt and blame, not a prescription for how society should function.

*May you walk the path of your ancestors with understanding and compassion. May all guilt be transformed into wisdom, all blame into clarity. May your knees be freed from the weight of the past, and may you move forward with lightness and grace. I Am the Path of My Ancestors.*
