## Overview

On January 24th, Matias addresses Economy—perhaps the most materially impactful of all Physical Week systems, yet fundamentally rooted in the Heart Chakra and the spiritual principle of giving and receiving.

The word economy comes from Greek: "oikos" (home) + "nomos" (distribution). Economy = administration of the home. Not the nation, not the corporation—the home. The fundamental unit where resources are distributed among family members.

The spiritual key of the heart is GIVING AND RECEIVING. The heart is the circulatory system sharing blood to every organ, distributing resources throughout the whole body (home). This is the origin of economy: organic distribution according to need, constant flow, no hoarding.

Matias divides economy into two dimensions:

**1. PHYSICAL ECONOMY:**
   - Biological/Organic: How nature distributes resources (like the heart/blood)
   - Cultural/Biological: How humanity evolved systems of exchange

**2. EMOTIONAL ECONOMY:**
   - Cultural/Emotional: How we give/receive power in relationships
   - Service/Emotional: How we share our gifts with the world

The teaching traces the evolution of economic systems: from sharing food in caves, to storage for winter, to creating value based on strength, to exchange between families, to the invention of money, to hierarchies of divine power, to modern systems of debt and dependency.

The revolutionary insights:

- Money has NO power—money represents power (the strength required to obtain it)
- The rich seek POWER, not money
- "Poor" originally meant "lack of fertility/power," not lack of money
- "Rich" originally meant "aligned with divine power," not material wealth
- Systems of debt were created to keep the "soul poor" dependent
- Money is not the problem—the illusion of power outside yourself is the problem

The core question: If you could govern yourself, know who you are, and know what you have within—would you need anything outside?

We cannot heal the economic system of the world until we first realize our inner economy—how we give and receive within ourselves (spirit-soul-body balance) and in our relationships (emotional distribution).

For spiritual workers: You're not charging for your spiritual service (which has no value). You're charging for the time you need to survive (eat, sleep, produce) in order to DO your service.

The solution: Come back to the heart. Administer your own resources within (emotional and physical). Practice abundance: share everything you have within, and everything will come to you again.

## Core Teaching

### Etymology: Economy = Administration of the Home

Economy comes from Greek:

"Oikos" (οἶκος) = home, house

"Nomos" (νόμος) = distribution, administration, law

Economy = administration of the home

The fundamental economic unit is not the nation, not the corporation, not the market—it's the HOME.

How do we distribute resources among those who live in the same house, the same family?

That's economy in its original essence.

### The Heart: Spiritual Giving and Receiving

Many humans think the heart is only spiritual, but it's not exactly like this—even though the heart IS spiritual.

The spiritual key of the heart is GIVING AND RECEIVING.

From that point of view, the heart is the one that gives and receives the resources we have in our body—the circulatory system sharing blood to every organ.

It helps the body work.

That's why the spiritual economy is to have balance distributing resources throughout the whole body that we call HOME.

The heart is the perfect model of economy:
- Circulates resources (blood/oxygen/nutrients)
- Distributes to every part according to need
- Receives back from every part
- Constant flow, no hoarding
- Organic, responsive, balanced

This is what economy was meant to be in human society.

### Physical Economy: The Heart as Model

The heart is the organ that stimulates the distribution of blood.

Everything in nature needs to be distributed, needs to move around constantly.

Every organ knows when it needs something.

Every organ administers its own use of blood according to the day and the action being taken.

When you eat, the stomach and intestines need blood to make the work happen. Blood goes to the digestive system. Once digestion ends, blood starts to distribute again along the body.

When you have sex, you have all the blood in your genitals. Then when you release, it starts to spread all over again.

The KEY of organic economy:

Every organ is sharing the resources whenever they need it—NOT because they expect to have it all for themselves.

There's no organ that naturally wants to have the whole blood for itself.

Naturally, the body is distributing, helping to circulate blood all around the body.

The key for this system is: CIRCULATORY.

That is the key of natural economics: CIRCULATION, not accumulation.

### The Evolution of Economic Systems

From the first moment we started to be humans, everything we created was only for THREE THINGS:

1. To EAT
2. To REPRODUCE
3. To SLEEP

Those are the ONLY three things that all of us in the animal kingdom share.

Everything humans have created was about solving these three things.

The difference between us and all the rest of the animals: We evolved through CONSCIOUSNESS, through INTELLIGENCE, through IMAGINATION—using our MIND.

**STAGE 1: SHARING FOOD**

We work all together as groups. We share with one another. We create emotional links to hold us together through religions, cultures, concepts.

Why? Because we needed to survive by sharing food.

This concept of sharing food is to distribute what we have hunted, harvested, collected from the trees, to share it with members of the family in a cave, in a home.

Here comes the FIRST concept of economy: To distribute what we have accomplished to get.

**STAGE 2: STORING FOR SURVIVAL**

When we started to be sedentary, we also administrated the rest that we had after we ate.

Why? Because we needed to survive the winter or the drought.

We took all that surplus and administrated this food so we could survive the winter.

**STAGE 3: PROTECTION AND VALUE**

Once we have food, we need to solve the other conflict: to SLEEP.

Sleep is to be SAFE, to feel we can REST.

Someone must protect you from everything.

Who is the one that would protect you? The STRONGEST one. The one that has STRENGTH.

That one is the most VALUABLE person.

In European languages, those people who had strength to protect the herd were called "the WELL."

WELL, VALUE (from Latin "valere"): "Well" is the origin of the word VALUE.

The meaning is: STRENGTH, FORCE.

The one that is STRONG is the person that has VALUE.

This is how we started to create the concept of the VALUE of things:

Something has VALUE because someone did something with STRENGTH to get that.

VALUE = STRENGTH required to obtain something.

**STAGE 4: EXCHANGE AND REPRODUCTION**

Once we accomplished sleeping and eating, sometimes we would have a lot of some things, but we would be in lack of other things.

We need to start to SHARE with other people.

In this EXCHANGE, we create a new system of economy: EXCHANGE with other families.

Here comes when we solve REPRODUCTION—which is the transcendence of the family.

Reproduction and PRODUCTION are linked.

**STAGE 5: THE INVENTION OF MONEY**

When civilizations grow, a problem arises: "I have everything I need. Why should I exchange with you?"

Someone really clever said: "What if we take this WEIGHT that we were sharing of things and use something that we cannot eat, we cannot use for anything else, except EXCHANGING?"

They took MINERALS from the mountains.

That's how MONEY was created: COINS.

They started to exchange minerals: Gold, Bronze, Silver, Diamonds.

But most of all: SALT.

Why SALT? Because salt was useful for EVERYTHING: Food (flavor, preservation), Healing (medicine for wounds), Storage (preserving meals).

That's why they started to call payment to people: SALARY (from SALT).

Then they looked for minerals more DIFFICULT to get: Gold, Silver.

Why do these have more value?

It's NOT because the thing has value by itself.

Value is STRENGTH, is FORCE.

To get gold and silver is very DIFFICULT. A lot of people had to work REALLY HARD to get gold and silver.

This is why gold and silver have so much value: Not the material itself, but because in ancient times you had to work VERY HARD to get it.

CRITICAL INSIGHT:

Money does NOT have value.

Money has the VALUE of what I DID in order to get it.

Money REPRESENTS value. Money IS NOT value.

### The Divine Hierarchy of Wealth

In ancient times they said: "Who has much more POWER and STRENGTH in creation? God."

That's why: The PRIESTS, the KINGS and QUEENS were the ones that had to have MUCH MORE GOLD—because they had the POWER.

The STRONGEST one has much more VALUE. And the VALUE is GOD.

This creates a PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURE of money that says: "The POWER is in those who are at the TOP."

### The Origin of "RICH" and "POOR"

The word RICH (from northern European languages):

"RAKE" in ancient languages = the one that has the RIGHT

In Latin: "REX" = to rule

In northern languages: "RAKE" = the one that has the POWER

The RICH people, talking about the divine system, are: The ones that have the POWER OF GOD, like the king.

NOT the ones that have the money.

Throughout history: RICH PEOPLE were never looking for MONEY. RICH PEOPLE look for POWER.

Money does NOT have power. Money COMES WITH power.

If you lose your power, you don't have money.

That's why rich people represent POWER, not money.

For us, the COMMON PEOPLE: We believe that money has the power. But money has NO power.

We believe that MONEY creates corruption in people. Money is NOT corruption.

POWER—which is an ILLUSION—is what corrupts people. NOT the money.

POOR: Comes from Latin "pauper" = with a LACK OF FERTILITY

Someone that has NOT power.

Poor = without fertility, without power to create.

"Poor people" were considered to have a LACK OF FERTILITY because they were working the fields, and whoever doesn't grow anything in the fields, they are "poor" (not fertile).

"Rich" was considered: The one aligned with the divine, aligned with divine power.

### Understanding Power

What is the REAL conflict? POWER.

What is power? RECTITUDE. To be in the CENTER. To be COHERENT with yourself.

To know WHO YOU ARE and to know WHAT YOU HAVE.

If you know what you have, you don't need anything outside.

But if you don't know who you are and you don't know what you have within, you will look for things outside until you try to reach who you maybe are.

### The Creation of Debt

When civilization starts to grow:

There are some POOR that get a LOT OF MONEY. But they are STILL POOR. They are POOR IN SOUL, but they have lots of money—the "NEW RICH."

What happens? This "new rich" (poor in soul with lots of money) starts to look for MORE. So it says: "Hey, don't worry if you have a lack of something. I will share with you. I will give you something. But then you will have to GIVE IT TO ME BACK at the end of the year."

That's the FIRST DEBT.

This is how they started to get a FALSE POWER.

Here comes the origin of: The ones that give LOANS to people—like a BANK—that store, share, transfer, hold resources.

Remember who these were? The POOR people (poor in soul) that started to accumulate more and more.

### The System of Keeping People "Poor in Soul"

What happened with this system?

These "new rich" people started to create the idea that: "Money is DEBT."

"If someone needs something, you just have to ASK for it, and I will GIVE it to you."

The Church, the State started to give to the poor and said: "Hey, it's GOOD to be poor. You just ask whatever you need, and we are in service."

"Money is not good. Money is devil. We are in service."

By this, the system starts to: TAKE the POWER from the poor people, making them POOR and POOR from the SOUL.

The concept here is NOT to help the poor people.

The concept is: To GIVE to the poor people whatever they want, so you can KEEP THEM POOR FROM THE SOUL.

So they DON'T get the development of the self, and we hold a system of DEPENDENCE.

### Taking Responsibility

We are NOT here to try to blame anyone. We are here to TAKE RESPONSIBILITY to understand that:

In the process of history, WE THE PEOPLE gave our power away to others.

Our responsibility is NOT to fight against those old people.

Our responsibility is to GET OUR POWER BACK from inside first.

To come back to be RICH OF SOUL.

Remember: ECONOMY was created at HOME. Economy means administration of the heart, of home.

We are NOT going to be able to heal the economy system of the world if we first don't realize about our INNER ECONOMY in GIVING AND RECEIVING.

### Emotional Economy: The Real Solution

All the economy systems of today are related to GIVING POWER to others.

Why do we lose the power of the economical system? Because we started to do it by LOSING THE POWER OF OUR OWN HEART.

We GIVE OUR POWER to: Those who we love, Someone in the family, Someone in school, A partner in a relationship.

We give our power to others.

It will be IMPOSSIBLE for us to administer our physical resources if we are not even ready to administer our own EMOTIONAL resources.

**1. EMOTIONAL CULTURAL ECONOMY:**

How am I giving and receiving emotionally/culturally?

Questions to ask:
- Am I giving a lot?
- Am I receiving too much?
- Am I controlling someone?
- Who am I giving the power to?

**2. EMOTIONAL SERVICE ECONOMY:**

All those that have a GIFT inside that they have to share with others.

Questions to ask:
- Am I giving my gift to others, sharing my gift?
- Or am I expecting something to come to me in order to give it?

Because sometimes we WAIT for something for us to do it. But in order for everything to MOVE, to FLOW, we need to GIVE, to SHARE.

Here comes the concept of ABUNDANCE.

### Abundance: The True Concept

ABUNDANCE is when: Everything that I have WITHIN, I SHARE IT, I share it with everyone OUTSIDE. So everything will come to me AGAIN.

ABUNDANCE is NOT the ability to have things.

ABUNDANCE is the ability to ADMINISTRATE all you have WITHIN.

### The Question About Charging for Spiritual Work

"If you work with spirituality, why do you charge for it?"

Where does this concept come from—"you should not charge if you are spiritual"? It comes from the CHURCH.

The idea is that those who come from the spiritual world must be IN SERVICE, must be SERVANTS OF GOD.

"Money is for this world, from the devil. So if you are working for the spiritual world, you win HEAVEN, not this world. So you should NOT CHARGE for your service, because you are spiritual."

This is the concept of the Christian church in the Middle Ages to ensure that nobody would become rich.

### The Answer to "Why Do You Charge?"

We are SPIRITS that decided to be on this planet. And on this planet we are HUMANS. And as HUMAN, I have a BODY.

And what was the Trinity of the body?

1. I have to SLEEP
2. I have to EAT
3. I have to REPRODUCE or PRODUCE

If I don't eat properly, I'm not able to survive. If I don't sleep relaxed, I'm not able to think and to give. If I cannot produce or reproduce, I am not transcending.

And even if I am in another world with my mind, I am in a PHYSICAL one in the matter.

If I don't take care of the physical aspect, how can I be in service?

Remember: SPIRITUAL SERVICE has NO VALUE. Spiritual service has NO VALUE at all.

What has VALUE? The TIME that I need to SURVIVE and do my service.

So you are NEVER charging for your service. You are charging for the TIME that you need to SURVIVE in order to do your service.

For some people, the value would be $1. For some people, the value would be $1,000.

What gives the value? Your OWN THINKING and NEED.

Need is what creates the value of things. NOTHING has value by itself. WE GIVE the value to the things.

So remember: What is economy? To come back to HOME and to ORDER what we have WITHIN.

And once we ORDER our economy, we EXPAND this economy outside as the circulatory system.

The economy is in the HEART.

## Practice

### Meditation: The Home of the Heart

1. Sit comfortable, close your eyes.

2. Take a deep breath and start to make a soft massage from your feet to your head.

3. Become aware of your breathing.

4. This perfect machine, which is your body—you created it!

5. Become aware, paying attention to each part of your body: The muscles, the bones, glands, organs. Above all, the CIRCULATORY and NERVOUS SYSTEM.

6. Think about your BRAIN—this amazing organ made with neurons, cells that expand information by pulling all around the body to each cell.

7. Pay attention to your HEART and its heartbeat—pulsed by electricity, pushing the blood through the veins of your body, bringing oxygen and nutrients, flourishing the entire body, each cell of it.

8. Pay attention to your DIGESTIVE SYSTEM—the organs are a perfect combination that absorb everything that makes you good and expel everything that hurts you.

9. Bring attention to your GENITALS—receiving the beauty of the technology that manifests and generates life.

10. My entire body is the PERFECT WAY of creation and design—my spirit, imposed by the energy of my soul.

11. Now I recognize that I am also only one cell inside a huge network of other human cells.

12. Imagine that network.

13. We are the perfect design of technology. We are the spirit manifested in the matter.

14. Between all of us, we create: Tools, Cultures, Civilizations, Art.

15. We are the CREATORS of our own reality.

16. Take a deep breath. Think of your body as a HOUSE.

17. Within this house, I find: A MOTHER called SOUL, A FATHER called SPIRIT. Both of them are the ones that administrate the resources of my body.

18. I become aware that the only way I can be abundant in the resources and use of my body is if I find BALANCE between this Father and Mother—by the COHERENCE of my inner self, I find abundance of the resources I have.

19. The MAIN FORCE, the main RESOURCE that I need in order to create is based in the ETERNITY that I call LOVE.

20. I take this INFERTILE TERRAIN, this POOR LAND within me, and I water it with the RAIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS of the RICH SPIRIT.

21. I feel, I imagine how this spirit is pouring this water of consciousness to the dry land of my body, helping to rise the FLOWERS of the ESSENCE, the LOVE of my SOUL.

22. Repeat:
    - "I Am the Essence of Love."
    - "I Am the Essence of Love."
    - "I Am the Essence of Love."

23. "I Am the HOME. I Am the ORDER of my own resources. I Am the ECONOMY."

24. "From my HEART, I expand my own ABUNDANCE."

25. "So by RESONANCE, I receive the same abundance."

26. Take a deep breath and take this consciousness all over your body, expand it, expand this consciousness to each part of it.

27. In your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Throughout the day, practice the economy of the heart:

1. **Notice your inner economy (giving/receiving within yourself):**
   - Is your spirit (Father) giving ideas to your soul (Mother)?
   - Is your soul giving energy to your body (child)?
   - Is the system circulating (balanced flow) or blocked (hoarding/lack)?

2. **Notice your emotional economy (giving/receiving with others):**
   - Are you giving too much (depleting yourself)?
   - Are you receiving too much (becoming dependent)?
   - Are you hoarding (withholding your gifts, waiting for payment first)?
   - Are you giving power away (to partner, family, authority)?

3. **Practice abundance:**
   - Share what you have within—your gifts, ideas, presence, love
   - Notice: Does this create flow? Does more come to you?
   - Trust the circulatory system: What you give circulates back

4. **Question your relationship with money:**
   - Do you think money has power, or do you recognize money represents the strength you used to get it?
   - Are you seeking money (which has no power) or developing your own power (which attracts resources)?
   - Do you know who you are and what you have within? If yes, do you need anything outside?

5. **Honor your physical needs:**
   - If you're in spiritual service, are you taking care of your body (eat, sleep, produce)?
   - Are you charging for time to survive to do your service, or feeling guilty about having needs?

### Applying This Teaching

- Stop blaming external economic systems—start administering your own inner economy (spirit-soul-body balance, emotional giving/receiving)
- Recognize: Money is not the problem—the illusion that power is outside yourself is the problem
- Develop your own power—know who you are, know what you have within—then you won't need to seek outside yourself
- Practice circulation, not accumulation—like the heart distributes blood to all organs according to need
- If you're spiritual and charging for services: You're not charging for spirit (no value)—you're charging for time to survive (eat, sleep, produce) to DO your service

### Physical Week Context

This is the fourth day of the Physical Week (BODY 'ESSENCE'):

Day 171 - Religion (Crown): Tie back to divine essence  
Day 172 - Politics (Third Eye): Sail through conscious essence  
Day 173 - Education (Throat): Draw truth essence from within  
Day 174 - Economy (Heart): Circulate love essence through giving/receiving

The progression:
- Crown → Connect to source
- Third Eye → Navigate consciously
- Throat → Express truth
- Heart → DISTRIBUTE RESOURCES

All are systems where spiritual essence manifests in physical structures.

Economy is the Heart Chakra of civilization—how we circulate resources (physical and emotional) throughout the body (home, family, society).

Tomorrow: Technology (Solar Plexus)—the creation system and the Essence of "I Am."

## Questions for Reflection

**Q: What does "economy" originally mean, and why is that significant?**

Economy = Greek "oikos" (home) + "nomos" (distribution)—"administration of the home." This is significant because the fundamental economic unit is the HOME, not the nation or corporation. Economy is about how we distribute resources among those who live together as family. Just like the heart circulates blood to every organ in the body (home), true economy is organic circulation according to need—constant flow, no hoarding.

**Q: How does the heart model the perfect economy?**

The heart circulates blood to every organ, distributing resources according to need. When you eat, blood goes to digestive system. When you have sex, blood goes to genitals. Then it redistributes. Every organ shares resources when needed, NOT expecting to have it all for themselves. No organ hoards blood. The key is CIRCULATORY—constant flow, responsive distribution, organic balance. Accumulation in one place would kill the body—just as economic hoarding kills society.

**Q: What are the three things all human economic systems were created to solve?**

To EAT (survival, sustenance), To REPRODUCE (transcendence, family), To SLEEP (safety, protection). These are the SAME three things all animals need. The ONLY difference with humans: we evolved through CONSCIOUSNESS, INTELLIGENCE, IMAGINATION—using our MIND to solve these problems. Everything we created was about solving these three needs.

**Q: What does "value" originally mean?**

VALUE = STRENGTH, FORCE (from Latin "valere" = to be strong/well). The one that is STRONG has VALUE. In early societies, the strongest protected the herd—they had the most value. Something has value because someone did something with STRENGTH to get it. Gold and silver have value NOT because of the material, but because in ancient times you had to work VERY HARD to get them. Money does NOT have value—money REPRESENTS the value of what you DID to get it.

**Q: What is the difference between "rich" and "poor" in their original meanings?**

RICH = aligned with own power, aligned with the divine. Someone who doesn't NEED money because has power. Originally referred to those with God's power, but the essence is inner alignment with power/divinity.

POOR = lack of fertility, lack of power to create (from Latin "pauper"). Not lack of money, but lack of inner creative power/fertility.

The key: Poor/rich is about SOUL STATE (inner power/creativity), not material wealth. You can be "poor in soul" with lots of money, or "rich in soul" with little money.

**Q: Why does Matias say "money is not the problem, power is"?**

Because money has NO power—money REPRESENTS power (the strength used to get it). People think money corrupts, but money is neutral. POWER (the ILLUSION that it's outside yourself) corrupts people. What is power? COHERENCE with yourself, knowing WHO YOU ARE and WHAT YOU HAVE WITHIN. If you know who you are and what you have within, you don't NEED anything outside. The problem is we don't know ourselves, so we seek external power/money to fill the void.

**Q: How were systems of debt created to keep people "poor in soul"?**

The "new rich" (poor in soul with money) wanted more power, so they created DEBT: "I'll give you something, but give it back later." The Church/State said: "It's GOOD to be poor—just ask what you need, we'll give it. Money is devil." By GIVING people what they want, the system keeps them POOR IN SOUL—they never develop self-power, they remain DEPENDENT. The concept is NOT to help the poor—it's to KEEP them poor (in soul) so they depend on the system.

**Q: How do we heal the economic system?**

NOT by fighting external systems, but by healing INNER ECONOMY first: Spirit-soul-body balance (giving/receiving within yourself), and emotional economy (how we give/receive in relationships). Until we administrate our OWN emotional resources, we cannot administrate physical resources. Come back to HOME (heart), ORDER what you have WITHIN, then EXPAND that economy outside like the circulatory system.

**Q: Why is it okay to charge for spiritual work?**

Because spiritual service has NO VALUE—but what HAS value is the TIME you need to SURVIVE (eat, sleep, produce) to DO your service. You're NEVER charging for your service—you're charging for the TIME to survive in order to do it. We are spirits on this planet as HUMANS with BODIES. We must eat, sleep, produce. If I don't take care of the physical aspect, how can I be in service? Honor your body's needs—you're in the third dimension with physical requirements.
