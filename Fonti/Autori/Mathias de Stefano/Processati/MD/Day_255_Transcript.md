## Overview

Today we tackle one of the most misunderstood concepts in spirituality and self-help: **the problem**.

Most teachings tell you to:
- Eliminate your problems
- Get rid of obstacles
- Clear blocks
- Remove resistance

But what if **problems are not meant to be eliminated**?

What if they're meant to be **transcended**?

---

## Etymology of Problem

### Breaking Down the Word

**Problem** comes from Greek:
- **Pro** = ahead, in front, forward
- **Ballein** = to throw, to cast strongly

**Problem literally means: to throw ahead strongly.**

Related words:
- **Ball** (something thrown)
- **Ballistic** (trajectory of throwing)
- **Symbol** (sym+ballein = to throw together)

### Problem as Forward Force

A problem is **something thrown in front of you** that **pushes you forward**.

It's not an obstacle meant to stop you.

**It's a force designed to make you move forward, evolve, transcend.**

---

## Solution: Releasing the Rope

### Etymology of Solution

**Solution** comes from:
- **Solve** = to loosen, to release, to dissolve

Related to:
- **Resolve** (re+solve = to release again)
- **Absolute** (ab+solute = released from)
- **Dissolve** (dis+solve = to release apart)

### The Metaphor

Imagine a problem as a **ball thrown ahead of you, attached to your hand by a rope**.

The ball (problem) pulls you forward.

You have two options:

1. **Hold the rope tightly** → The ball keeps pulling → You struggle → You call it "a problem"

2. **Release the rope** (solve) → The ball continues its trajectory → You continue yours → You transcend

**Solution doesn't mean the problem disappears. It means you release your attachment to it.**

---

## Cultural Misunderstanding

### What We're Taught

Modern culture, especially self-help and spirituality, teaches:

"Problems are bad. Eliminate them. Clear them. Get rid of them."

**This is fundamentally wrong.**

### The Truth

**Problems are designed for evolution.**

If you eliminate a problem, you also eliminate:
- The wisdom it was teaching you
- The evolution it was offering you
- The transcendence it was pushing you toward

**You don't lose just the problem. You lose the solution too.**

### Matias' Summary

"Problem and solution, just with these two words, are the summary of every self-help book."

Most books teach: Find the problem → Eliminate it → Be happy.

**Real wisdom teaches: Find the problem → Understand it → Transcend it → Evolve.**

## The Cube: Understanding Problem Geometry

### Three Axes of Problems

Imagine a **cube**. It has three axes, each with two poles (positive and negative direction):

#### 1. Vertical Axis (Inner/Spiritual)

- **Positive pole**: Crown, higher self, spiritual connection
- **Negative pole**: Root, grounding, material reality

**Problems on this axis**: Inner conflicts, spiritual crises, questions about meaning and purpose.

#### 2. Horizontal Axis (Love Ones/Family)

- **Positive pole**: Connection, intimacy, closeness
- **Negative pole**: Independence, boundaries, separation

**Problems on this axis**: Relationship conflicts, family issues, friend dynamics.

#### 3. Depth Axis (Enemies/World)

- **Positive pole**: Moving toward the world
- **Negative pole**: Pulling back from the world

**Problems on this axis**: Conflicts with "others," societal issues, people you don't like.

### Expansion Creates Problems

When you **expand** (grow, evolve, stretch), you extend along these three axes.

As you extend, you encounter **resistance**—this resistance is what we call **problems**.

**The problem is proof you're expanding.**

### Contraction Creates Conflict

When the forces on opposite poles of an axis **contract back toward each other**, they create **conflict**.

**Conflict is when forces hit each other head-on.**

Example:
- You try to be more spiritual (vertical expansion)
- Your material needs pull you back (vertical contraction)
- The two forces hit each other = conflict

### Problem vs. Conflict

- **Problem**: The ball thrown ahead (pushes you forward constantly)
- **Conflict**: Forces hitting together (momentary collision during contraction)

**Problems are constant. Conflicts are temporary.**

---

## Three Types of Problems

### 1. Inner Problems (Vertical Axis)

Problems with:
- Your identity
- Your purpose
- Your spiritual path
- Your material needs

**Question that keeps you stuck**: "Why do I have these inner conflicts?"

**Question that transcends**: "What is this inner tension teaching me to integrate?"

### 2. Relational Problems (Horizontal Axis)

Problems with:
- Family
- Partners
- Friends
- Loved ones

**Question that keeps you stuck**: "Why are they doing this to me?"

**Question that transcends**: "What am I learning about love, boundaries, and connection through this?"

### 3. External Problems (Depth Axis)

Problems with:
- Society
- "Enemies"
- The world
- Systems

**Question that keeps you stuck**: "Why is the world/this person against me?"

**Question that transcends**: "What is this opposition reflecting about my relationship with the world?"

---

## Transcendence vs. Elimination

### Elimination

**Trying to eliminate a problem**:
- Removes the forward push
- Stops your evolution on that axis
- Makes you lose the wisdom the problem was teaching
- Often causes the problem to return later (because the lesson wasn't learned)

Example: "I hate conflict with my mother, so I'll just never talk to her again."

Result: You eliminated the problem, but you also eliminated the opportunity to learn about boundaries, forgiveness, unconditional love, etc.

### Transcendence

**Transcending a problem**:
- Changes the question from "Why is this happening to me?" to "What am I learning?"
- Allows you to move forward **with** the wisdom
- Keeps the evolution going
- Transforms the problem into a **teacher**

Example: "This conflict with my mother keeps appearing. What is it teaching me about my own need for approval? About setting boundaries? About accepting people as they are?"

Result: You transcend the problem by evolving yourself. The problem might remain (your mother might not change), but **you** change your relationship to it.

---

## The Practice of Transformation

### Step 1: Identify the Axis

When a problem appears, ask:

"Is this an inner problem (vertical), a relational problem (horizontal), or an external problem (depth)?"

This helps you understand **where the expansion is happening**.

### Step 2: Change the Question

**Don't ask**: "Why is this happening to me? How do I eliminate this?"

**Ask**: "What am I learning? How am I being pushed to evolve?"

### Step 3: Release the Rope

Recognize: The problem is doing its job (pushing you forward).

You don't need to:
- Fight it
- Cling to it
- Identify with it

**Just release the rope.**

Let the problem continue its trajectory. Let yourself continue yours.

You transcend.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Become aware of your breath and body.

### Solar Plexus Activation

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark.

Bring this light to your **solar plexus**.

### Recognizing Your Problems

Think of a problem you're currently facing.

Notice which axis it belongs to:
- Inner (vertical)?
- Relational (horizontal)?
- External (depth)?

### Changing the Question

Instead of asking "Why is this happening to me?":

Ask: **"What am I learning? How is this pushing me to evolve?"**

### Sound Practice

Sound: **Rï**

**I am unified wisdom. I am unified wisdom. I am unified wisdom.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Releasing the Rope

Visualize the problem as a ball thrown ahead of you, connected by a rope.

Feel yourself holding the rope tightly (the struggle).

Now, with **conscious intention**, **release the rope**.

Watch the ball continue its trajectory.

Watch yourself continue yours.

### Crown Through Root

Bring this **unified wisdom** through all chakras:

- **Crown**: Inner problems transcended through new understanding
- **Third Eye**: Perception problems transcended through new vision
- **Throat**: Communication problems transcended through new truth
- **Heart**: Emotional problems transcended through new feeling
- **Solar Plexus**: Identity problems transcended through new being
- **Sacral**: Creative problems transcended through new creation
- **Root**: Reality problems transcended through new ground
- **Knees and Ankles**: Path problems transcended through new direction

### Integration

Feel the **unification** now:

- Problems are not enemies
- Problems are evolution tools
- Transcendence is not elimination
- Wisdom comes through, not around, problems

You are unified with your problems as teachers.

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Stretch. Yawn. Return here and now at your own time.

## Key Insights

- Problem (pro+ballein) = to throw ahead strongly; designed to push you forward, not stop you.
- Solution (solve) = to release, to loosen the rope; not to make the problem disappear but to release attachment to it.
- Cultural misunderstanding: We're taught to eliminate problems, but that also eliminates the wisdom and evolution they offer.
- Cube model: Three axes of problems (vertical/inner, horizontal/relational, depth/external).
- Expansion creates problems (resistance encountered while growing); contraction creates conflicts (forces hitting together).
- Problem = constant forward force; conflict = temporary collision.
- Elimination removes the problem AND the solution/wisdom; transcendence keeps both.
- Three problem types: Inner (spiritual/material), Relational (family/loved ones), External (world/enemies).
- Change the question from "Why is this happening to me?" to "What am I learning?"
- Release the rope = solution; continue your trajectory while letting the problem continue its own.
- "Problem and solution are the summary of every self-help book."

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

When a problem appears today, **don't immediately try to fix or eliminate it**.

First, pause and ask:

1. "Which axis is this on?" (Inner, relational, external)
2. "What am I learning?"
3. "How is this pushing me to evolve?"

### The Transcendence Journal

Write about your current problems:

- **The Problem**: Describe it
- **The Axis**: Which dimension (inner/relational/external)
- **The Old Question**: "Why is this happening? How do I eliminate it?"
- **The New Question**: "What am I learning? How am I evolving?"
- **The Transcendence**: What changes when you shift questions?

### Releasing the Rope Practice

For one problem today:

1. Visualize it as a ball thrown ahead
2. Feel the rope connecting it to you
3. Notice the tension of holding on
4. Consciously release the rope
5. Observe what happens to your relationship with the problem

## Week Context

Aries Emotional Week - Wisdom Theme:

- Day 1 (Crown): Answer - spiritual wisdom
- Day 2 (Third Eye): Intention - conscious wisdom
- Day 3 (Throat): Set Free - coherent wisdom
- Day 4 (Heart): Impetus - loving wisdom
- **Day 5 (Solar Plexus): Problem - unified wisdom**
- Days 6-10 continuing...

Aries energy is about **moving forward**, initiating, pushing through. Today's teaching shows that **problems are not obstacles to Aries energy—they ARE the Aries energy** pushing you to evolve. When you understand this, you unify with the force rather than fighting it.

## Q&A

### Q: So I should never try to solve problems? Just accept them?

No. Transcendence is not passive acceptance. It's actively **changing your relationship** to the problem by changing the question. You still take action—but from wisdom, not from the desire to eliminate what's teaching you.

### Q: What if a problem is genuinely harmful (like abuse or danger)?

Physical safety is different. Remove yourself from harm. But even then, the **learning** (boundaries, self-worth, recognizing patterns) transcends the situation. You can leave the harmful situation AND learn from it.

### Q: How do I know if I'm transcending or just avoiding?

Transcendence includes the wisdom; avoidance doesn't. Ask: "Have I learned something? Have I evolved? Or am I just running away from discomfort?"

### Q: Can a problem ever actually be eliminated?

Surface-level problems can be solved (car breaks down → fix it). But **existential problems** (identity, purpose, relationships, meaning) are never eliminated—they evolve into deeper versions of themselves. That's growth.

### Q: What if the problem keeps coming back?

That means there's still wisdom to extract. The problem returns because the **lesson hasn't been learned**. Change the question you're asking about it.

### Q: How does this relate to yesterday's teaching on Impetus?

Impetus taught you to turn questions inward (conscious force). Problem teaches you that the questions themselves are evolution tools. Combined: Use conscious force (impetus) to extract wisdom from problems instead of fighting them.

### Q: What's the difference between a problem and a conflict?

Problem = constant forward push (the ball thrown ahead). Conflict = temporary collision when expanding forces contract back together. Problems are designed for evolution; conflicts are momentary resistance during growth.

### Q: How do I release the rope if I don't even know I'm holding it?

Awareness is the first step. When you notice you're struggling with a problem, you've noticed the rope. Then you can choose: keep holding (struggle) or release (transcend).
