## Introduction

I am everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

I hope and you will. Must say that I am not really in the best of my states today because I am a little bit headache. I guess that because of what we are working and releasing and all the things.

So , guess that this is what happening.

So , we have to deal with it.

So , let 's go. Let 's begin. We are talking about our topic for today which is problem. Let 's resigning the word problem.

So , just in case , if you see something going on the screen is not the fairy is , is almost veto.

So , first of all , let 's try to understand what is a problem. But because , but from the point of view of our cultures today , a problem basically is those things that you have to solve that otherwise , if you do n't solve them , you are not going to be able to move forward or to leave plainly your life. And this is the idea that has been created in our cultures by saying that we all have these problems that we have to deal with and that we have to transcend in order to live properly and in harmony. And then when we go to the school , they start to present us problems that we have to solve.

And then in the exams , we have many problems that if we do n't solve them , if we do n't solve them , we are not going to be accepted socially speaking.

So , we are not going to be able to go farther to move ahead if we do n't do it properly.

So , in our subconscious mind , in our unconscious mind , we start to create this idea that we have to solve the problems in order to be accepted by others. With this idea that we have about problems , there is someone that is living its life by survival and that wants to to survive physically , emotionally and mentally. Usually , this person will try to avoid problems. Simply , because that person is trying to survive and to live comfortable , not to have anything to fight for.

So , to be in a comfort zone. This is why we do n't want to have problems we do n't want to find any problems.

So , culturally , we created the idea that problems are those things that can take us to instability , to take us to a point where we are not going to be able to handle even our own lives and we ca n't even die.

So , that 's why people try to avoid problems.

So , we also have , in the other hand , this idea of problems. There are some people from many areas like Indigenous scientists , philosophers , architects , whatever , in agriculture , many people , many different branches that they dedicate their lives to find problems , that their job is to find problems to create problems in order to know the ways to solve them.

So , in this way , we have a lot of people in the world that use the problems as something that improves humanity , society , science , reality , everything that we live in , our world as we know it , is made because of people that have thought on different problems to understand what solutions can we find to those problems. And these people , usually , tend to face the problem in order to know how to solve it.

So , somehow this means that in a part of that person , it does n't exist this need of comfort in order to survive , but exist something that tells you about transcendence , to transcend something. And here comes the technology of the world problem , which is much more related to transcendence than to not knowing how to solve something. Problem.

So , problem comes from two Greek words , pro that means that means ahead. And , ballet , that means to throw strongly , strongly , to throw strongly.

So , that would be to throw something with a lot of strength ahead , throw something ahead. That 's a meaning of problem.

So , a problem would be to throw something really hard ahead without thinking about the consequences of what you have thrown.

So , of course , we have , for every problem , we have a solution with its verb to solve , that comes from solver in Latin. That means to set free to release something. Topic that we are already spoke about.

So , to take literally the technology of the words , the example would be , the problem is when you have something and you throw it very fast and far away , but that thing that you throw is connected with a rope.

So , you throw it away , but if you do n't let it go , if you do n't release the rope , you will be drawn with that , like pull by the force of the object.

So , in order for you not to fell down , you just leave it away. You release the court and that 's solution to solve.

So , speaking only about the technology , this is an example to remember the technology of both things.

So , when you think about these two words , now you can get this idea that a problem is something that we are attached to , that is pushing us ahead , that is pushing us with strength , with the force that we do n't have. The problem is like moving us forward with all this strength that we do n't want to move. We lose our axis because of the pushing of this object , the thing that was thrown away.

So , this means that we are pushed and we are losing our axis because we are attached to what has been thrown away in the future , ahead of us. How can we solve the problem by letting it go , releasing the tension? Live in it away. As you see , just by the technology of these two words , it 's like a whole book of how to say this , how to do it to help yourself.

I do n't know the name in English of this kind of book that are for yourself awareness and these things. Self-help. Thank you. Self-help.

Books. Thank you.

So , it 's a logically speaking problem and solution , just with the only words are the summary of every self-help book.

So , the reason why a problem appears once and again , once and again , is basically because we are attached to that problem because we are constantly attached to that person , situation , concept , object.

So , from different points of view , from our inside , we are still attached to that thing that is thrown away.

So , the way in which we are going to solve a problem is by transcluding the problem , not to eliminate the problem.

So , a problem has been designed in order to help us evolve , to help us improve ourselves , to give us something new with a solution , experience , knowledge , wisdom. When we want to eliminate a problem , what happens with us is that we do n't have also this solution. We do n't have also the wisdom , the knowledge , the experience.

So , we do n't develop. We keep staying exactly like the same. This is why a problem is a synonym for transcluding an evolution. We all hear exist because of the problems.

So , the same word of the same word problem is helping us to understand our own evolution. That we are here because of the problems.

So , the same word problem , the thing that we are pulled , pushed , sorry , pushed and thrown away in front , we are pushed in front. That 's what the problem is mean. A problem is helping us to move forward constantly. But once we reach there , we have to let it go.

We have to resolve solve the problem. To solve the problem is to let go the problem. Otherwise , we throw it away in a way and we are repeating exactly the same. This is something that you will see from different views in your life , in the problems of your life.

Now I 'm going to speak about it from three different points of views.

So , here we have a cube. You see the shape? We have a cube and inside we have this line that connects the faces.

So , we have one line here straight connecting the up and down. The other line here , connecting the both sides right and left. And then we have another line here connecting front and back of the cube. Each one of these lines has two different directions , one that is positive , the other one that is negative.

As you can see , all the force have come from the center of the cube here in intersection.

So , all this shape of the cube has emerged from the core and all the forces will come back to the core.

So , we have here that this vertical line here will have a positive and a negative side of the line.

So , we can say here that if all this strength was in the core , this is like the big band.

So , eventually , it will explode and expand the force this image in positive and negative.

So , it will expand so much the positive and one side and the negative and the other side. That all the forces will be thrown with a lot of strength ahead in air all the directions of the universe. That is why we can call this line of positive and negative a problem. The expansion then would be a problem.

So , we can say here that the emerges when the two forces expand. But of course , that positive and negative , they attract each other. They come back to the center.

So , they will start to close up one to another and as much closer they get the first they start to move.

So , they hit each other. They collapse to each other. And this is what in Latin we call conflict. Come meaning all together all the forces and flick to the means hit.

It means the , yes , the hit.

So , there would be a conflict when all the forces find together again. The problem is expansion , the conflict , the contraction. This is another way to see this expansion of the universe.

So , this means that the universe expands itself looking for problems , trying to find different ways.

So , eventually the universe will need for all those problems to find each other in order to integrate all this experimentation so it can be transcluded.

So , that moment when all the problems find themselves together in one point , we call that have been a conflict.

So , I have not been thinking that I have to give any example of what a problem is because we all have some kind of problem. And of course , we all have some kind of conflict.

So , as a basics , we 'll let 's say that a problem is something that we know that we have , but maybe it 's in the future is coming or we are thinking about it. And the conflict is something that is happening right now that you have to solve it right now.

So , exactly the conflict is the one that is right now and that we have to solve because the problem is the one that has been creating the different possibilities for my evolution. The conflict is to leave that process of evolution and suddenly when you just release , when you find the subject to that , is when you understand that you are really acquire , integrated that evolution , the tools for that evolution. Let 's see the lines.

So , we have here these three ways of problems , conflicts and solutions. Which is , one is the high , yeah , happens high , relates to the spiritual with one self. The other one is the weight related to the emotional with friends and family , all the known people. And then we have the depth , which is the physical related to the enemies.

First of all , we have the inner conflict. What would be the line? The line that have a positive and the negative crossing the whole being that we are that I am and we have these problems that are created in our own existence that then they created conflict when they come back in the center in one chara , it creates a conflict and that conflict must be solved by our own self.

So , we have a conflict between our emotional , our physical , our mind , our beliefs , we have an inner conflict that we have to solve by ourselves. And the way we solve something from ourselves is when we release the tension knowing that this is just an inner process and so on. But let 's go to the problem So , the second one is the horizontal. The horizontal is related with the line of the arms to the sides.

So , from here we have the connection with the family , the friends , the lovers , all the ones that we are together as one.

So , when we expand like this , we create problems with them , with these people , with the ones we love.

So , then this love comes back back , creating a conflict inside related to those people that we are connected to. This is the conflict.

So , so what do we have to do? The problem is the conflict is within ourselves.

So , when we release the tension , when we solve the how we solve the problem , release the tension from inside and release them from the tension also. That would be. And the other one , which is the depth , is ready to the back and blunt.

So , this one is the one that is related with the enemies. What it means , the traces and the wars in front of us.

So , it 's problems with people that we do n't know or problems that we have no idea about that they come from behind and we do n't know how to face them , or also those problems of the enemies that come from from in front that are these people that are fighting with us , even if they are not connected to us in our love.

So , are those who we go and war in battle we face.

So , when we expand that , we create the problems and then they come back , creating the conflict. How do I solve this by releasing the tension?

So , of course , that for one problem there is thousands of solutions and there are thousands of problems.

So , it 's impossible for me to say how to solve a problem because each one of you has a different way to solve the problem. But what I can really say is kind of the key of how it is to solve a problem which is to let go , set in free. And that 's what I 'm going to try just like.

Remember that these days we have been speaking about what is intention , what is detention , what is the conflict.

So , now remember that we have three strings. One strings that connect me with myself , another string that connects me with the love in ones , love ones , and another string that connects me with the world.

So , now , when remember the tension , everything is connected by these strings.

So , we are all connected by this tension , we share this tension.

So , if one of those strings starts to stretch more and more and one of them release the tension , the strength comes really hard to the one that is holding it.

So , when someone release the tension , some suffers the effect of that release.

So , this can be like this with our inner self , like this with the outer world , and like this with the one love.

So , if I 'm here loving someone and that someone leaves me and release the tension , the one that is suffering is me. And I stay with all this energy here.

So , suddenly when comes another person , I want to say , oh , now I love you.

So , can you hold this please? Can you hold this for me?

So , as you see , it is exactly the same.

Okay , so eventually you will have the same energy.

So , the same problem is repeated.

So , now like this , I will recognize that the problem is not in the other one. Who has the problem?

So , the conflict that we have , the emotions that we feel are only in us. The other one does n't have it. What is the most logic solution for this problem?

So , I do n't repeat exactly the same. The solution is to let go. You go on by another one. I would like for us to understand something from this.

So , this here is a problem.

So , the reason why I can know that I am attached to this problem is when in my life the same things are repeating ones and again. The same people , the same situations , everything is repeating ones and again ones.

So , again.

So , how can I make this thing to you into something that instead of bringing me the same problem once and again , helps me to evolve.

So , now , we will see another way to let go. Pay attention. The next is called Transcendence.

So , now to transcend a problem to create a problem into another thing.

So , we have here this link with someone with a person.

## Q&A

So , when I recognize the problem , instead of waiting for that person to release and I get stuck with all this , what I do is to change the question.

So , instead of asking why this person is reflecting me this or doing this to me , I turn the energy questioning why do I see this from this person , simple change that brings us to transcendence.

Okay.

So , this is the way in which we can understand now , how to make a problem , how to transform a problem before it gets a conflict , before it begins to be a conflict. You make it into transcendence.

So , the problem here does n't make a conflict , but it was a release of the tension. And the problem became evolution , moving myself forward. Because if I release the tension , I do n't have anything. I just stay in one spot.

I do n't do anything. Does n't have any meaning , any sense , anything.

So , the one that usually do n't want to face the problem , because to face the problem is to do this and say , oh , this is the problem. The one that do n't want to face the problem just get stuck in this connection. And that 's not changing. It 's the comfort zone and you stay like this with this butt energy all time.

And this is how a problem can take us into another level of consciousness. I did n't erase the problem. I just use it as a way to jump into another level of consciousness. To end this with ourselves.

So , now , let 's imagine that we have here this. And we have this problem with the person and we say , why? Why this person is doing this to me? If I am a good person , I did n't do anything bad.

I 'm always a fine person , a good person. How can I transform this within myself? The change of this question would be , what is this person reflecting to me? What is this person willing to me?

So , I can teach better to others , to help others. Or I can do another jump like , what am I learning from this situation?

So , as a product , maybe you have to buy some of this and do this in the face of people , but do n't release it on face people.

So , let 's go to the alignment. The code for today is Venus. The next planet on the list is an ocean of toxic , toxic gases and volcanoes in constant eruption that makes it look glory and beautiful from here. It 's light attracted also illustrations of the world , decorating and enhancing the observers of this kind.

It 's names , it 's name originates from the word when meaning love , beauty , desire. What has given this world those characteristics , being the divinity of love , of relationships , of the sire and passion. I become aware of the space I find myself in , the body , I inhabit my briefings. And in front of me , I observe a light and the vines spark that is my soul and breath and ignite it.

## Guided Meditation

I receive this train of light in my crown chara. I recognize here all the problems that I have according to my beliefs. I send the intention to release them in the fighting the spark of the crown. I breathe the scent of this divine spark to my third eye.

I recognize here the problems that I have because of my thoughts. I set the intention to release , resolve this problems by fighting throughout my brain and my eyes this part. I descend as the vines spark to my third chara. I take you moment to think about the problems that I have for those things that I said.

They and those things that I have in said. And I set the intention to solve the problems. Ignite this divine spark throughout my throat. I descend as the vines spark to my heart.

I bring the intention to the problems that I have for that that I feel. I am sending tension to solve this problems in the fighting the spark in my heart. I descend as the vines spark to my third chara. I put the intention to recognize the problems originated in my ego.

I set the intention to solve this problems in the fighting this spark in my bloodsus. I descend as the spark to my second chara. I recognize the problems that I have in order to create this life. And I set the intention to solve this problems in the fighting this spark throughout all my creative center.

## Energy Work

I descend this spark to my root chara. I have been able to recognize the problems that I have in order to manifest what I want in this life. And I set the intention to solve this problems , the night in the spark of my room. I 've ascend this far to my knees.

I met my friends and I met my friends. I met my friends. I met my friends. And I set the intention to solve them by night in the spark of my knees.

I set the intention to solve them by night in the spark of my room. I set the device part to my feet. I could realize the problems that does n't allow me to move forward in my path. I set the intention to solve them by night in the spark of my feet.

I expand all this sparks in all the directions knowing that they are the problems that push me forward to my own evolution. And in my sound I release. I am the units with them. I am units with them.

I am units with them. I am I am I am I am. I take a deep breath , bring this consciousness all throughout my body , stretch and young. And each one at a time , come back here and now.

Thank you everybody for being here as always. See you tomorrow at the same time.
