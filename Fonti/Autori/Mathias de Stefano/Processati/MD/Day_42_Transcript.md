## Overview

Welcome to the second day of the emotional week, where we shift our focus from understanding what emotions are to comprehending how we project them outward into the world. While Day 41 taught us that external vibrations create internal emotional reactions, today we explore the opposite flow: how our internal state creates vibrations that affect the external world. This is the work of the third eye—the chakra of vision, perception, and projection.

Many people join this journey at different points, and it's important to understand that this is a year-long process. You don't need to follow it day by day rigidly; you can adapt it to your own inner rhythm and timing. This is a process for each individual, designed to help you work with your inner being at whatever pace serves you best. Whether you join the daily wave or start from the beginning later, what matters is your commitment to the inner work.

Yesterday we explored how the outer world sends us vibrations that change our inner energy through the movement and reaction of energy within. This creates what we call emotions—energetical reactions to vibrations coming from outside. Today, we must remember and recognize that emotion is an energetical reaction of vibration, which creates a chemical reaction in our body that activates hormones, sending pulses to our brain that understands this information as emotion.

Today's teaching addresses a common misconception in spiritual and emotional communities: that emotion is somehow magical or mystical, something we're not supposed to analyze with the mind but only feel with the heart. While we're not against feeling, we must also understand emotions to know how to handle them properly. Understanding doesn't diminish feeling—it empowers it.

## Core Teaching

### Magic, Alchemy, and the Science of Emotion

The word "magic" comes from the European word that means power. This concept was inherited from the Persians, who created the word "marush," meaning "the one who has the power." Magic literally means power—the power of those who knew how to handle reality, to manage matter, to work with chemistry.

In Arabic languages, we say "al-qamiya," which is the origin of the word alchemy. Alchemy is the ability to have the power to transform reality through science. Magic is just a concept we use to explain the science that hasn't been discovered yet or the science we cannot yet understand. When we try to understand the magical world, we're simply exploring different aspects of reality we cannot yet fully comprehend but can definitely feel.

This is crucial to understand: feeling is what we usually relate to the magical realm, but we must recognize that it's important to realize that everything that exists in matter is just the expression of chemistry. By understanding chemistry, we understand the basis of energy, the frequencies, the vibration—which is the language of spirit. Everything is one. All is one. Emotion is a consequence of the mind interpreting vibrational information.

Remember: emotion comes from an interpretation of the world. Emotions are the chemical reactions—the potions of magic that allow me to feel the world. We have two different ways we can relate ourselves to these emotional potions: from the outer side, where we receive energy to create the potions of emotions within ourselves, or from within, where we know how to create these potions ourselves and project them into the outside world.

### The Reversal: Inner World Transforming Outer Reality

Yesterday we spoke about how the outside world creates reactions in the inside, transforming our inner state. Today we explore how from the inner world, from the inside, we can create reactions that make a transformation in the outside world. Just as energies from the outer world transform the inner world, we can use energy from within to transform the outer world.

We do this constantly—all the time. Usually, we do it through unconscious means, unaware of the process. Because we do it unconsciously, we sometimes do it very badly, creating effects we don't intend. What we do naturally, often without awareness, is provoke emotions in the people around us. We provoke actions and attitudes in the people we have around ourselves. We've naturalized this so completely that we don't usually realize we are transforming people around ourselves just by being present, just by sitting in the same space, just by sharing proximity with others.

The power we have is real—it's a tangible power we can use to transform things. But we don't know how to use it consciously, so we just see the reactions in the outer world without understanding our role in creating them. Someone gets mad at us, someone feels something for us, and we think, "I don't know why"—but it's the pulses of ourselves, our own energy, pushing outward and creating emotional reactions in others.

### The Naturalization of Emotional Influence

It's incredible how we've materialized and naturalized the fact that just by being present, we can affect the emotions of someone else. We think about this as cultural, as traditional, as just normal. For example, if I produce love in someone, that person will love me—we've just naturalized this as a cultural phenomenon. But it's not merely cultural; we need to understand it at its basis, in its quantum and chemical aspects.

This is powerful. It's a power you have within. Just as we must recognize that we are like sponges absorbing everything from outside and transforming it into emotional reactions, we must also recognize that we create pulses that generate reactions and create emotions in others. The same energy that comes to us and transforms our life is the same energy we can give outward to transform the lives of others.

Any emotion or pulse—whether negative or positive—will create a wave of reaction. One easy way to see if we've worked well with ourselves, if we've achieved coherence within, is by observing the reactions of the people around us. The people around us will react according to the pulses of energy we are sending. This is what we usually call "the others are a mirror of yourself." They are reflecting what you project.

### Mirrors, Echoes, and Resonance

Have you ever asked yourself how this reflection actually works? It works through echoes. We must remember we are in the middle of an ocean, inside an ocean, within the water. All the water around us is vibration. Whenever I move myself, the waves move outward. Whatever I'm pulsing from myself starts to pulse outside of me. All the bodies around me receive these waves, and they come back to me as echoes, like the sonar of a ship.

This sonar effect comes back to me, and that's how I see the reflection of myself. This is how we see ourselves reflected in some people. It's not that the person is literally a reflection of us in the sense of being identical to us. Rather, because I am projecting energy around me, the body of that person is echoing my own energy back to me, and I see myself in that person through this echo.

To understand this better, imagine the person as a wall or a rock. I project energy, and the echoes hit the rock or wall and come back to me. This understanding helps us comprehend forgiveness in a new way. Forgiveness is not about forgiving the person per se; it's about "for-give"—to give away, to give forward. Forgiveness means giving away the idea of that person being a reflection of myself. The person was just receiving the echo of what I expressed; they have nothing inherently in common with my projection. I have to let that person be free from my perspective and my projections.

Everything we have around us functions as objects upon which our own pulse reflects back to us. In all the things we see, we see ourselves reflected constantly. Sometimes the thing we're seeing is actually in the same vibration as us, and we're receiving our own pulse reflected back. This helps us become very responsible for what we're putting out into the world.

### The Mirror vs. The Echo: A Critical Distinction

We must think carefully about what we are reflecting to others and what we are receiving as a reflection of ourselves. Everything that exists, every living being, is creating a pulse—even if it has just one cell, it's sending out energy. That's why every person, everything, is making echoes one to another constantly.

Picture yourself inside a cave. The cave has many corners, many stalactites and stalagmites. You say something, you express a sound, and the echo of that sound resonates in every aspect of the cave. The sound won't be perfect—there are many different surfaces, and each one will receive and reflect a different pattern of energy.

This is why every person is like an echo, a resounding of the whole existence. Usually we are repeating these echoes unconsciously. This is what we do every day just by talking, just by being—we move constantly all the echoes around us. Now imagine that you are a stalactite in the cave, and another person is another stalactite. Picture tuning forks: when one tuning fork starts to vibrate, the resounding goes to the other one, and it starts to resonate in the same vibration.

This is what we call the mirror effect. It's not exactly a mirror—it's a resonance, a resounding of the other one. When I become conscious, I recognize that I am the one able to create and originate one of those vibrations. Suddenly, by being conscious, I realize that just by my being present, other people start to express emotions, attitudes, and behaviors. We call this the mirror, but it's better to say that the other person is echoing myself.

### Understanding What We Receive from Outside

When we see emotions coming from outside, appearing to come from other people toward us, we must ask ourselves: What energy did I allow myself to express that is now coming back toward me in this way? Of course, we can put ourselves in the position of "I'm not doing anything wrong; I'm receiving attacks from people who are hurting me or doing bad things to me." But this happens not because we're doing something morally good or bad—it's about low vibration or high vibration.

Maybe you are vibrating low, and therefore the only thing you can receive is low vibration. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that there are "bad people" and "good people," or that you're doing good things but bad things happen to you anyway. Don't fall into this mistake: bad things are not inherently low vibration, and good things are not inherently high vibration. Don't confuse moral judgment with energetic frequency.

The question we have to solve today is: What emotions am I receiving from the outside in my daily life, and what is the pulse I am emitting in order to receive that energy and emotion? This is the task we must work with today. Everything we are feeling from the outer world is connected to the energy we are pulsing toward the outside. What am I pulsing outward? When I can understand this, I know if I'm okay, if I'm in balance, if I'm creating the reality I truly want.

This understanding of the mirror is crucial: How is my inner state creating the mirror I see reflected back to me? When I become aware of the power I have within, I start to pulse differently. When I decide what to pulse into the outside world, the response will be different according to my pulse. I must take responsibility for what I'm creating through my presence and my energy.

### Transformation vs. Change: The 360 vs. 180 Degree Path

Today's teaching addresses an important distinction between changing and transforming. These two concepts must be understood clearly because they represent fundamentally different approaches to evolution. To change is a concept of polarity and duality. To transform is a concept of unity and transcendence.

To understand change, imagine a circle or sphere. To make a 180-degree change means to switch from one side to another. You were looking in one direction, and then you look in the opposite direction. Day changes to night; night changes to day. This is change—a reversal, a flip to the opposite polarity.

Transformation, however, is a turn of 360 degrees. You make the whole turn around the circle. You were in one spot, you traveled the complete circle experiencing all perspectives, and you returned to the same spot. But in that trip, you saw all the perspectives you could possibly experience. Then you came back to share and give what you have learned and experienced. This is transformation.

For example, a change of 180 degrees would be someone who was a scientist and atheist who suddenly has an awakening experience. This person changes their mind completely—suddenly they become a yoga teacher or Reiki master, and they don't want to see anything about science anymore. That's a change—a flip to the opposite.

To transform would be the same scientist having an awakening but then acquiring ideas from Reiki, yoga, and many other spiritual practices to help improve their own perception of reality. They can help themselves and others through learning different things, but they use these insights to actually help within science, to improve scientific understanding and practice. That's transformation—integrating all perspectives without abandoning the foundation.

### Change and Transformation in Our Lives

This distinction between change and transformation is critically important to understand how we pulse into the world. When I start to pulse change in my life, suddenly the rest of reality from my perspective also changes. They change in the opposite direction. Suddenly I lose friends, I lose family connections, I lose everyone. I changed by turning my back to them, by going 180 degrees in the opposite direction.

If I pulse from transformation, it's different. If I pulse from transformation, I can help others also transform themselves by watching how I am transforming myself step by step. I share my change; I'm not just turning my back to others. I hope that by demonstrating my transformation, others can witness the process and find their own path of transformation.

By saying this, I hope we have clarity about what the pulse is, about the vibration we project. Everything I am explaining right now is not just an explanation—it's part of the alignment process itself. One of the things I will tell all of you who are following every day: don't keep everything I say as if it is 100% the absolute truth.

For a network to be flexible, we need to understand that each person has their own truth. This is why you should always listen to different people, learn from people who explain the same things in different ways. This is the only way we can make these emotional and energetic links we create more flexible, more adaptable, more capable of genuine transformation rather than mere change.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably and begin to caress your body, acknowledging it as the anchor of the spiritual world in matter. Relax your body completely, leaving the weight to fall down naturally. Let gravity support you. Focus deeply on your breathing, making it conscious and intentional.

Take a deep breath, bringing the oxygen through your nose, down to your lungs, into your heart, circulating through your blood to reach your organs and muscles. Allow yourself to feel the heat within your body, the life force energy that sustains you.

### Guided Meditation Steps

1. **Perceiving Your Energetic Ocean**
   - Feel how the heat within your body emanates through your skin toward every direction around you
   - Start to perceive the ocean of energy and vibration surrounding you
   - Feel yourself inside the water, below the surface of this vast ocean
   - Perceive how the waves of energy and emotion move your body softly from side to side, front to back
   - Recognize that this ocean is made with all the vibrations and energies that create the movement of creation itself
   - This ocean contains your own emotions and connects you with everything that exists

2. **Rising Toward the Light of Consciousness**
   - Allow yourself to feel above you the light of the sun—the energy of the I Am, pure consciousness
   - Take a deep breath and begin to rise slowly toward the surface
   - Feel the limit where the water touches your crown
   - Experience the heat of the sun, the light of consciousness touching your crown as you emerge
   - Go a little higher until you feel your head emerging like an island from the ocean
   - The water surrounds your head, falling to just below your eyes, at your nose, at your ears
   - Feel half of your head outside in the air, the rest of your body below the water

3. **Awakening Vision and Perception**
   - Feel the light of the sun all over your eyes, your hair, your head, ears, and nose
   - Allow yourself to observe the limits of the ocean, where it divides the sea from the sky
   - Watch all the waves around you
   - Recognize that you can observe, visualize, and contemplate all the energy that moves you and that you move
   - Feel the light of the I Am in your eyes, in your crown, activating your vision

4. **Igniting the Spark of Vision**
   - Take a deep breath and begin to enlighten the spark of your vision
   - Start vibrating the sound: PHae... PHae... PHae...
   - Keep pronouncing the sound, allowing yourself to enlighten the fire within
   - Feel the light radiating through your eyes, projecting toward the horizon
   - Allow yourself to see the ocean of energies expanding before you
   - The sound activates your third eye, your capacity to perceive and project

5. **Recognizing Your Creative Power**
   - Continue the vibration: PHae... PHae... PHae...
   - Recognize: "I Am the Spark of Vision"
   - Say it again: "I Am the Spark of Vision... I Am the Spark of Vision"
   - Acknowledge that with your vision, with your perception, you can move the waves of the ocean with consciousness

6. **Integrating the Realization**
   - Take your hands to your heart
   - Become aware that everything you observe in the exterior is an echo of what exists within
   - Recognize that you are able to move energy, to pulse it outward from consciousness
   - Recognize that everything outside is a reflection of the inside, of your perception
   - Understand: If I shine, everything around me will shine
   - Affirm again: "I Am the Spark of Vision... I Am the Spark of Vision... I Am the Spark of Vision"

### Closing

Take a deep breath. From your heart, start to move your body, caressing it, touching the water around you metaphorically, stretching, yawning. Come back to full awareness of your physical body in this present moment, opening your eyes when you're ready.

Remember the task: watch the ocean around you. See how it is related to you through emotions. Then ask yourself: From what place, from what energy, am I pulsing into reality? What am I creating through my presence?

- **"To change is 180 degrees—flipping to the opposite. To transform is 360 degrees—experiencing all perspectives and returning enriched with wisdom."**

- **"When I pulse change, I lose connections. When I pulse transformation, I help others transform by witnessing my process."**

- **"Maybe you are vibrating low, and therefore the only thing you can receive is low vibration. It's not about good or bad—it's about frequency."**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Write down a sentence or paragraph explaining what pulse you believe you are emitting into the world. Try to understand what emotions and reactions are coming back to you from others and trace them to the energy you're projecting. This isn't about self-blame or judgment—it's about taking responsibility for your energetic presence and becoming conscious of how you affect your environment.

Look specifically at recurring patterns in how people respond to you. If people often seem angry around you, what might you be pulsing that creates resonance with anger? If people seem uplifted, what are you emanating that creates that effect? The goal is awareness, not perfection.

### Applying This Teaching

Begin observing yourself in interactions with others. Before you enter a room, take a moment to check what energy you're carrying. Notice your emotional state, your thoughts, your expectations. Recognize that these internal states will pulse outward and affect everyone you encounter.

Experiment with consciously shifting your internal pulse before interactions. If you're feeling frustrated or anxious, take a moment to breathe, center yourself, and choose a different vibration to project. Notice how people respond differently when you enter with different energetic states.

Remember the distinction between change and transformation. When you recognize something about yourself you want to evolve, don't just flip to the opposite (change). Instead, integrate the insight while maintaining your foundation (transformation). This creates genuine growth rather than reactive swinging between polarities.

Practice seeing others as echoes rather than mirrors. When someone reflects something back to you that's difficult to see, remember they're not the source—they're simply bouncing back the energy you're projecting. This removes blame from the equation and returns responsibility to where it belongs: with you and your pulse.

## Q&A

### Q: If I'm constantly affecting others with my energy, does that mean I'm responsible for their emotions?

No, you are responsible for your own pulse, not for how others choose to receive and respond to it. You affect the environment with your energy, but each person has their own resonance and their own filters. Two people can receive the same pulse from you and have completely different reactions based on their own internal state. You are responsible for being conscious of what you're projecting, but others are responsible for their own responses. Think of it like sound: you can make a sound, but whether someone hears it as music or noise depends on their own ears and preferences.

### Q: How can I tell if I'm projecting negative energy unconsciously?

Look at the patterns in how people respond to you. If you consistently receive back anger, defensiveness, or withdrawal from multiple people in different contexts, you may be unconsciously projecting agitation, judgment, or disconnection. The key word is "consistently"—occasional difficult responses happen to everyone. But if you notice a recurring pattern, it's time to examine what you might be pulsing outward. The outer world is your feedback system. Use it not for self-judgment but for self-awareness.

### Q: What's the difference between changing my vibration and being fake or inauthentic?

Choosing to shift your vibration consciously is not being fake—it's being responsible and conscious. Being authentic doesn't mean dumping every negative emotion on everyone around you. Authenticity is being aware of what you're feeling and making conscious choices about how to express and transform that energy. If you're anxious but choose to center yourself before meeting a friend, you're not being fake—you're being conscious and considerate. You're still experiencing the anxiety; you're just not unconsciously projecting it onto others.

### Q: How does the echo/mirror concept help with forgiveness?

When you understand that others are echoing your energy rather than being inherent sources of negativity toward you, it transforms forgiveness. You're not forgiving them for being "bad" to you—you're releasing the idea that they are reflections of your projections. They were simply surfaces off which your energy bounced. For-give means to give away, to release. You release them from being carriers of your own energy back to you. This makes forgiveness easier because you're not trying to excuse bad behavior—you're simply taking responsibility for your part in the energetic dynamic.

### Q: Can I really transform other people by transforming myself, or is that just wishful thinking?

You cannot force anyone to transform, but your transformation absolutely affects the field around you. When you genuinely transform (not just change superficially), you emit a different frequency. People who are ready to resonate with that frequency will begin to shift in response. It's like the tuning fork example—when you vibrate at a new frequency, others nearby who are capable of that frequency will start to resonate. But some tuning forks are built for different notes, and that's okay. Your job is your own transformation; influence on others is a natural side effect, not a goal.

### Q: What if I'm vibrating high but still receiving low-vibration responses?

First, question whether you're truly vibrating high or if you're projecting a high vibration while suppressing a low one underneath. Often what we think is high vibration is actually spiritual bypassing—pretending everything is light while shadow energy lurks beneath. Second, remember that you might be in environments or relationships that were established when you vibrated differently. There may be a lag time before your new vibration creates new echoes. Third, sometimes high vibration includes appropriate boundaries and healthy challenge, which others might initially experience as "negative" before they recognize it as growth-inducing.

### Q: How do I know if I'm changing (180 degrees) or transforming (360 degrees)?

Change involves abandoning or rejecting what came before. If you're becoming spiritual by completely rejecting your previous life, relationships, or interests, you're likely changing (flipping to the opposite). Transformation involves integrating new perspectives while maintaining beneficial aspects of your foundation. If you're bringing spiritual insights into your existing life and relationships, enriching them rather than abandoning them, you're likely transforming. Change is either/or; transformation is both/and. Change creates division; transformation creates integration.

### Q: Why does becoming conscious make me more responsible for what others feel around me?

Becoming conscious doesn't make you more responsible—it makes you more aware of a responsibility you always had. You were always affecting others with your energy; you just weren't aware of it. Consciousness brings awareness, and with awareness comes the ability to respond (response-ability). This isn't a burden—it's empowerment. When you understand your pulse affects your reality, you gain the power to consciously create the reality you want through the energy you project. Unconsciousness means being pushed around by random emotional currents. Consciousness means becoming the navigator of your own ship.

---

**Note:** This teaching builds on Day 41's understanding of emotions as responses to external vibrations by revealing that we also constantly project vibrations outward that create responses in others and in our environment. The recognition of our creative power through conscious pulsing is essential for taking full responsibility for the reality we experience.
