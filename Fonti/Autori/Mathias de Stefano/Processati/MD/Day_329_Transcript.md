Oh. I take you to breath. And become aware of the entire body. Bring my attention to my feet.

Going towards the head and softly slowly. I move everyone of my joints and circles. I move my toes. And close.

Knees. Hip. Every vertebra of the spine. Fingers.

Knee. And the jaw. I start to yarn and to stretch the body moving it slowly. As if it is a don'tsom.

I move my toes. I move my toes. I move my toes. I move my toes.

I move my toes. I start to carry a spine. I start to carry a spine. I 'm in a way of each one of the actions that each part does.

As I touch that part of the body , I recognize the verb and covenant. Listen in and hearing for the ears. Watching , seeing. In the eyes.

Breathing. The nose. Talking. Eating.

I become aware that each part of my body is a product of an action. And that all of them in a conjunction together conforms the society that I am. I begin to maintain my feet. I am my society.
