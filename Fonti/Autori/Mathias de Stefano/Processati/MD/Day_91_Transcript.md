## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra:** `Crown`

## Introduction

Hello. Good morning , good afternoon , good evening. How are you?

Sorry , I must say that I am a little bit with a code.

So , I have my nose a bit. I do n't know how to say to English. But I 'm getting a bit of code.

So , I was pick a little bit weird. We are. I guess that this is happening right now because I guess my body felt this corps energy and saying , oh my god , we have to go down. Good just it.

That 's the word. Thank you. I 'm congested. And I guess that what I 'm congested , I 'm a little bit more British , who would I speak.

## Guided Meditation

I just was saying that I think that maybe I 'm the worst host of meditation and consciousness ever because I just , I 'm just young , your face and just cleaning my nose in front of you.

Sorry. But I guess that in such a way we are kind of a family , even if I do n't know you. Anyway.

So , usually , for me , well , we start Scorpio now. And usually for me , the month of October and Libre.

Sorry.

Sorry. The month of Libre , for me , it 's very hard , very difficult , because I usually get very bored in Libre. For me , the month of October usually is like very slow. And I do n't know what to do.

So , for me , it was like a year , basically this last month. And maybe it 's because I love this month , November. Because I have my main planets , all of them , they are in the eighth house , which is the house of Scorpio.

So , I feel a bit more comfortable in this energy.

So , I guess this would be a great month , both.

Sorry. I think that this would be a very funny meditation. With Lenin , I was like this.

## Practice Structure

So , we begin with Scorpio. And Scorpio is probably one of the most difficult months that we are going to work , because usually Scorpio takes us to the dark night of the soul , is the one that takes us to the depth of our self , and to show all the things that we do n't usually like in ourselves , to our shadows.

So , the reason why Scorpio is so heavy and so dark in such a way , is because it 's the only astrological sign that we show us the darkness , the darkness that we have. And not because Scorpio is dark , it 's because we usually hide all our old darkness.

So , as humans , we usually are in the constant pursuit of happiness. We want to be happy.

So , all the things that does n't make us happy , all the things that makes us feel uncomfortable , we usually take it away , or we hide it in a box , we live it away in the shadows , in the darkness.

So , we can not see it. We rather do n't see it , so we put it down there.

So , Scorpio is the one saying , no , you have to look at it , you have to watch it.

So , Scorpio takes all the dark things that are hidden in our bars , and throw it in our faces. Usually , usually , this scorpions are the people that are Scorpio , that has a lot of things in Scorpio. They usually are the ones that know exactly where to put the finger on the wand , like , here 's the wand , it press the wand. And this is because we were just not realizing about the wand , we do n't want to see the wand , and Scorpio says , I can see it.

So , when Scorpio discovers the wand , Scorpio is like happy to show us , oh , here it is , I found it. And because it 's their attribute , their goal.

So , they love to show , they enjoy to show where is the wand.

So , to find the weakness in people , is the most happy thing that a scorpion can find , because it 's their attribute , it 's the ability that they have to find the weakness , the thing that we were not seen.

So , the story of Scorpio , it 's from thousands of years ago. And the story says that this constellation first was known as the eagle constellation. And the eagle was like the higher self , represented the higher self that was able to see everything from above , that could see all the images that could see beyond , and all the shapes were there , and there was nothing able to be hide by from the eagle.

So , the eagle had this very perfect vision , so it could see for many kilometers away.

So , everything that the light was illuminating , somehow the eagle was like a little bit suburb , because they said , because he said , I can see everything. I can see all the things.

So , if I can see all of you , I can see everything.

So , I am the best. I am the one that is able to control all of you. That was his thought.

So , the universe said , no , you are not the best one.

So , you have to be punished , because you think you are better than the other ones , because you see everything from above.

So , your punishment will be to do exactly the opposite , to go into the darkness , to go into the depth of the ocean , where there is no light , to go into the mud , so you can not fly.

So , they put the universe , put the eagle into the ground , and the universe put it very deep in the pressure of the world.

So , what the eagle did was to become a scorpion , scrolling in the earth. And the eagle said , the best thing that I have was the vision , but now there is no light.

So , she evolved to see in darkness. And when the eagle took its potential of sight , to see in the darkness , she could see beyond the shapes , she could see inside the shapes.

So , this is why Scorpio is the one that can see darkness , is the one that can see through us , and to watch our weakness , our darkness within. By being in darkness , the eagle is not able to hunt anymore.

So , it 's big , big , big , okay. Thank you. The big of the eagle , it became the sting of the scorpion , okay.

So , by being in darkness , it created a way to defend itself , and a way in which the scorpion with defend itself is by the venom , that is inside the sting , okay.

So , this is related with the ability of the scorpion to put the venom , like to sting it , exactly in the point of weakness of someone to kill it , okay. That would be.

So , but what is the venom? The venom is the tool to survive in darkness.

So , we are the ones creating that venom. And it appears because of all the things that we do n't want to see , that we do n't want to analyze , and we put that in darkness.

So , the poison of the scorpion is not in the scorpion. The poison the venom is inside of us , okay. The poison is our own darkness , all the things that we hid in the dark , okay.

So , what the scorpion people do is to sting , exactly where there is the darkness in someone.

So , the venom , the poison creates a reaction. And now we can see what we were hidden.

So , all the things that we were hidden behind in the darkness now is shown , okay.

So , the poison becomes a way of healing , okay.

So , this is the ability of scorpion. This is why scorpion is a very uncomfortable energy for most of the people , because what they do is to go straight to the darkness to find a way to pick it from the bottom of our darkness , our hidden part , and take it outside so you can see it. And now what it wants to see , their own , their own darkness , of course.

So , this is why.

So , another thing of scorpion is that scorpion has the ability to make the invisible into visible. And this is that when they go into the depth of someone , when they go into the inner part of the soul of a person or of a reality , they just take the information from inside , okay. They just take that information out and make it visible.

Something that we are not seeing , something that we do n't appreciate , that we do n't recognize that we do n't want to see to see , to have in our lives , they have the ability to make it something visible.

So , this is why it 's also related to the spirit , to the spirits , to magic , to humanism , because they use the occultism , the ceremonies , all the dark things , the shapes , and all those , all of these different weird shapes of the darkness , and they take it from this invisible world into the visible one.

So , you can see it in the light.

So , this ability to make the invisible into visible , in the European languages , we may say , Mu , which is the origin of the word magic. This is why we also can relate the scorpion with magic , with all the invisible things , all the the alchemist that can take the venom of an animal , and create something to heal. All the things that were hidden becomes visible.

So , basically , the concept of this whole month is the ability of the higher self , which represented the ego , to become scorpion into the depth of this reality.

So , one thing that we have to see according to Scorpio is that this ego , the higher self , the spirit , the enlightened one , has to come to the earth to leave its own creation.

So , by coming to this planet , it starts to be in pressure.

So , this month also reminds us that the higher self has come to this reality to leave the pressure of its own creation. This is why it 's also related with the suffering , with the process of learning through the crisis , to be in under the pressure. And by this , we can understand the concept of depth , because basically , depth means an all this process of the spirit coming into the matter , is all about to touch the ground , to get into the bottom of the whole.

So , this would mean that the only way I have to go back to heavens is if I touch the bottom of the whole where I am digging in. Usually , we are willing to go up again , so we deny the bottom of the whole. We want to feel better to feel fine.

So , this is why we usually leave stuck in the middle , because we never go down. The only way to go up is by touching the bottom. When you touch the bottom , you now can face your own darkness , your own creation , and then you go up. This is why , in order to find , our own ligament to go to depth , we have to go to the very bottom of our darkness to face the darkness.

And from there , we can start to go up again.

So , basically , if we deny the depth of the abyss , we are just denying the tools that we have to go out of it. We as humans usually look for happiness to feel comfortable to feel fine. But this is something very physical , because what we usually want to do is to survive.

So , we want to feel safe and to feel fine. Because we want to be like , we want to be like this , living happily ever after. But the only way you can reach the enlightenment is when you face the darkness. When you go to your own shadows and you face your own problems , all the things that you have been denying.

So , in that moment , is when you can go through the darkness , and use the darkness as a way to find a light. You will find a light going through the darkness. A way in which we can understand why the spirits are willing to live under pressure in this life , is to understand something very cliché , or something very romantic in a way , which is diamonds can only exist under pressure. Diamonds are basically made of carbon , and like we do , we are carbon.

This body is made up with carbon , all the kills of carbon. But the pressure of the atmosphere of the ground , to the nucleus of the world , makes so much pressure to the atoms of carbon that it creates diamonds.

So , a diamond is something so hard and so shiny , so beautiful. They say , wow , this is so beautiful , but it was created by the biggest pressure ever. And so , in order to shine like a diamond , you have to live under pressure.

So , I do n't know if you have seen this from this point of view , but from the point of view of the spirit , that is willing to become a diamond. A human is the spiritual diamond , because , because basically humans are the physical aspect created by the pressure of reality , but what really we are is spiritual vibration , creating the atoms of carbon.

So , the spirit is higher than vibration that creates the carbon , and we are carbon in under pressure creating the body.

So , we are the diamonds of the spirit. This is why every spirit that wants to know how can they write , how can they become like a diamond , they have to be humans. The same way in which a diamond , I waste the wonder in us , like we are crazy for the diamonds , because they are like wow , so beautiful , this is perfect and how can something be so perfect.

So , for spirits , we are those diamonds , it 's exactly the same. And we say , how something under pressure can be so beautiful , and the spirits also say the same for us , it 's like , oh , how something living so under pressure can be so beautiful.

So , we are the diamonds of the spirit.

So , this is why we as humans have to live under pressure in a world of chaos , in a horrible situations , because this kind of pressure that we live in the world are the only ones that take the best of us. I do n't know if you have noticed that , but the pressure of the reality is the one that allows you to take all the darkness and make it shine. You can transform darkness into a bright reality , just by living under pressure. This is why I will advise you.

I will recommend you to take all the things that we are going to work doing this month , as this darkness , this shadows that will give us the opportunity to become a diamond under pressure. And this is why we have to go very deep.

So , the attribute of Scorpio for this whole non , according to the I am , will be I desire. And the desire basically means , in Latin , to be sit , sit , to be sat , to sat , to be sat. To sit somewhere , basically is that , to sit.

So , the reason why the sire means to be seated to sit , is because when I desire something , what is happening is that I am willing to feel pleasure to feel comfort. That 's the sire.

So , what means the sire in this concept of Scorpio , basically is to become sedentary. But the spiritual concept that we are going to work with is to put your butt in a current place. That 's what it should mean.

So , to make your s-field comfortable , basically that 's the sire. To seat properly in a place , and to feel comfortable , where you put your s-field. Basically it would be that.

So , the sire express the willing to feel comfortable.

So , what we are going to work with with the sire is to feel myself located in myself , where I have to be. Where I am supposed to be. That 's the word.

Sorry , I 'm a little bit diary , because this is going up.

So , let 's go to the information for today.

## Daily Practice Elements

So , remember that we start the mental week from the mind week for 10 days. And today , the first day is related to the crown chara. The vibration for today is men. The statement for today is I am the expansion of the mind.

The code for today is the law of generation. The seventh law of the universe is that everything has ability to generate realities. We are all creators , and within ourselves , we have the necessary power to manifest realities. For we are all divine beings made into matter.

We are projections of the universe , and this born creators. We are inevitably , inevitably , reverts of polarity.

So , I do n't know if you have heard it already , but today we also changed the music. For the whole month. And this music is related to the vegetable kingdom. We also take us to the death of the rainforest.

So , thank you , Ja , for the music.

Sorry , I have n't reacted so , from here to sleep. Just before we start something to clarify for all the people that maybe they are sensitive to energies , to beings , because we are going to go into the death , into the darkness.

So , I just recommend , we will do like a protection. But I recommend to warm your hands like this. Think like you have light , and use the heat on your neck back. Making it shine like a sun , very bright , and you do exactly the same in the kidneys.

Okay , the high of the kidneys , like this , thinking that it 's like two suns.

Okay , as a reminder , because there is people that is a friend of the darkness , and there is people very sensitive.

## Energy Work

So , this is just a reminder of how to take care of your main portals , because this and the kidneys are the most important.

So , it 's better to take care of them if you are very sensitive to the energy. And the people that is a friend , remember that to be a friend is basically to face things that you do n't know. And we are only going to face things from within. You are all things.

Okay , so all things that you know , but that you do n't want to see , basically.

Okay , so no need to be a friend.

## Guided Meditation

So , another important thing that throughout all this month , if you ever feel fear , if you are a friend of something or whatever , you just stop what you are doing , the meditation , stop it , you just bring your hands to your heart , feel your heartbeat , and you start to open your eyes , come in back here and now.

Okay , simple as that. And do n't do anything else. Do n't do anything else. Just in case you do it when you are not afraid.

Okay , that 's it. Because it 's not good to do it with fear , because you will feel uncomfortable.

So , there 's no need to do that. Yeah.

Remember to be sit.

Okay , to be sit it. Not laying down.

Okay , because when you lay down , you are just bringing information from the horizontal network and we have to try to be aligned.

Okay.

So nothing can bother us from this network. I am saying all this , all this advice , because as every month , I like to say how the month is going to be.

So , you have an idea of how it 's going to move the energy. But this does n't mean that it would be like heavy , okay? Or hard. Maybe it 's very soft and very good.

I do n't know. But it 's just for you to have an idea.

Okay? That if something happens , what can you do?

Another thing , I will be very heavy explaining things , but I do n't care.

So , another thing to understand is that we are not going to face the darkness to fight against darkness. Doing this whole month , what we are going to do is to integrate the darkness.

Okay? And this month is very important for all the rest that are going to come. Because all the other things that we will work with , without transcluding the darkness , without understanding the darkness , we are not going to be able to heal , to work with , to understand , to simulate all the rest of the informations to work in this reality.

So , that.

So , just the last thing and with this we start. For sure , there is a lot of people here that you are mediating , normal or good. But for some of the people , for many people , maybe you , you channel , you receive information , you are sensitive to energies or those things.

So , maybe some of these days , we will work with some darkness.

Okay?

So , when we were with darkness , for sure , they will feel that , oh , this is home , so they would come.

So , whoever is their sensitive to all these other beings , like demons , like entities or whatever that are around , all these free animals from other dimensions.

So , if you feel them , you have to let them know that this body is only yours.

So , what you will do is it does n't matter what we are doing , you just top everything that you are doing and put your back straight. And you say , I , in your own language , use your own language. If you are Italian , if you are French , whatever , you use your own language.

So , in your own language , you say , I am and your , at our name. And you repeat it all the times that you need.

Okay?

So , this will let them all know that this is only yours , that this is your body. And what you do that , you just enlighten from the heart with a lot of light , all the environment that you are in.

Okay? With many , many , many colors , as many as possible , not to take them away , but to embrace them , to give them light too , with many colors.

Okay?

So , what you are doing with this is to say , hey , you are invited , but to come to my party , you have to recognize that this is my home , this is me. And if you come to my party , you have to be dressed like a gay unicorn , okay? With many colors and all that.

So , basically , that would be. And you laugh a little bit , that would help always.

Okay? Cool , great. Let 's do it.

So , it does n't matter the position , what it 's important is that you have to spine like this. It 's straight. The first thing we are going to do is to see it comfortable and begin to move my shoulders in small circles. I focus in my breathing.

As I breathe in and breathe out , I start to relax my shoulders , letting the weight fall down. I give my eyes close. Take a deep breath. I become aware , pain attendees my feet , my legs , gentle , and arm , belly , chest and back.

Next. And head. I become aware of all my skin , recognize and have a corner of the largest organ that covers my body. Take a deep breath.

I become aware that all my skin is made with patterns , with failings , that shine in every direction. I recognize how my skin starts to shine like a freestyle , like a star. Brighter and brighter until it covers all my being and beyond. I recognize also this light shining inside my body.

Making my lungs to shine , muscles and organs. My entire body is now white. I perceive the light shining more and more , and rely on myself as the rays of sun. Moving through the atmosphere in this sky.

## Energy Work

I recognize that I am the higher self. I am. I recognize now that I am that light that has been coming through the crown chara to my body. All of this days.

And now it is my time to descend to the death of the matter. I observe the low results of my own body. I feel myself descending towards the crown of my body. I recognize myself shining in this lotus flower of my crown.

It is here when I recognize that the eye on me become its me. When I recognize that my spirit desires to leave in the matter of my life. I perceive myself as a ray of light. Coming through all the sense of my body.

I perceive in front of me my eyes. I feel the heart from within the stomach. I am in this time of genitals. I go through my legs reaching the feet.

I am the mind. Willing to manifest itself in matter. It 's my desire to leave in this world in this body. I desire my body here and now.

I desire the depths. I go outside for my feet towards the ground. I am going through the floor , reaching the soil , the minerals , the rocks. I keep going down through the roots towards the big rocks , crossing through the crust of the planet.

Feeling depression in my mind. I feel the pressure of all air of all its biosphere. I feel the pressure of the batman , ascending and psychodem. I contemplate with most beautiful diamonds around me.

I feel the iron core of the planet attract me with a lot of speed to the centre to the core of all things. The importance of going to the death is to find the centre. It is here in the centre , the core of all things under the greatest pressure in the darkness of the earth. What I will be able to recognize the importance of being in the death.

The importance of the darkness to face the reality , the truth , that all shadows , all pressures are the ones creating who I am. Take a deep breath and set the intention to expand your mind. I violate. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am. I am. I am.

I am. I am.
