## Overview

On the fourteenth day of alignment, we work with the plexus chakra in the emotional week, focusing on the ego and the self. Today's teaching challenges the common belief that the ego must be eliminated in order to reach the divine. Instead, we learn that the ego is a necessary tool for evolution and creation, and the true work is to balance the ego, not destroy it.

The vibration "Hï" combines "H" (life and history) with "Ï" (representing the flag or shield of a population, the unified connection). Today's statement is "I Am the Life in All Things," emphasizing that the self is connected to everything around it. The code teaches us that the creator is directly a reflection of its creations, and the "I" resonates like echoes, creating the posings of the dream and the awakened state.

This session provides a profound teaching on the nature of the ego, egoism, and egocentrism, using the metaphor of the Earth's axis and seasons to explain how the ego moves through different perspectives. We learn that the ego is not the enemy—it is the tool through which the divine creates and experiences reality.

## Core Teaching

### The Plexus Chakra and the Ego

The plexus chakra in the muscular aspect is related to the self, to the only one that is myself. In the emotional aspect, it is related to the connection with everything we have around, everything that is connected to me inside. The main idea we are exploring today is the ego and how it is a tool for evolution, not an obstacle.

### The Ego as a Tool for Evolution

The ego is just a tool, a tool to evolution, to evolve. The ego is a construction that helps build what is outside and is also built by all the things that are outside. It is like a symbiosis to connect with the outer world. We need to know how to handle the ego.

For sure, you have heard many teachings from many masters, many religions or traditions, and they have taught you that the ego is stopping you from connecting with the divine. One of the main things you have to do in order to reach the divine is to get rid of the ego. It is like something that doesn't allow you to connect with the divine.

I would say exactly the opposite. Those people or teachings that maybe are saying this—that the ego is not useful—are coming from people who have worked a lot with the ego, with themselves. When someone who has made the path tells you it is not useful, you don't know yet that it's not useful for you.

### The Ego is Necessary

The ego is the only tool you have in your daily life. It is the only thing you have to acknowledge who you are in this reality. You should not get rid of the ego. You need to understand what ego is and how to handle the ego so you can make the ego a correct tool toward the divine.

Ego means "I." "I Am" is ego in Latin, in Greek. There is nobody in the world without ego. Nobody. Everyone has a name. Everyone is reflected into others. You cannot say, "I don't have ego." If you exist, it is because of your ego. It is the only way you can be.

What you have to do is to work with the ego in order to be balanced so your ego is useful for you. This is what we are trying to work with in this path. We are not against the ego; we are helping the ego to be in balance.

### The Divine Needs the Ego to Create

One of the things explained in today's teaching is that the ego is important because the divine, the self, is someone or something that knows everything and is everything. The everything, the divine, can know everything in just one moment, in just one spot, but it cannot create without ego.

Ego is the one that goes away from the center to see perspectives and create all the arts, everything we create daily, everything we wish, everything we do, everything we aim in our lives—it is related to the ego, not to the spirit. This is why it is important to understand that both of them are one. It is "I Am." To make the "I Am," you need the "I" and you need the "Am." The "I" is the creative one; the "Am" is the one with the knowledge, with the wisdom. Both of them create everything.

We need to balance both of them in order to be a whole. We cannot eliminate the "I."

### The Earth's Axis: Understanding the Ego

As related in the blog, the ego is like the Earth with an axis. From the axis, it spins itself. The center is the ego. This axis is also moving, and this creates the seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter. These changes are different perspectives of the ego.

The ego is always the same axis. What happens is the movement. In Greek, you may say it "ism." When we say "schism," it means earthquake—it is an "ism." It comes from the Greek word meaning the movement of the self, the ego. We would say "egoism." Egoism means my axis, my ego, is moving toward different directions to invade different spaces.

### Egoism is Not Bad

Egoism is not bad. The bad aspect of the ego is when the axis, moving itself, suddenly forgets about its own center and wants to become the center in the place it is projected.

Imagine when we are moving this way, we are facing spring. In the other side, we are facing autumn. What happens when this movement stops? The axis, instead of moving around, just wants to be spring constantly. If the planet only experiences spring, the planet starts to die. You cannot be constantly spring.

This is the wrong act, the negative aspect of egoism.

### Example: Seeking Spirituality

For example, imagine you are seeking spirituality. You are willing to prove spirituality. You go to, for example, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Orthodox, whatever. You prove each one of them. The image would be the ego goes to each one of these religions. It wants to acknowledge and understand different perspectives of spirituality for itself, for the ego. It is not for the other ones. "I am looking for it. I am the one looking for enlightenment. I look for different ways"—spring, summer, autumn, different religions.

The bad aspect of egoism is when I move to one of those religions and suddenly I say, "Oh, this one is the one." For example, I pick Islam. I said, "This one is the one." I go to Judaism, I go to Christianity, I go to Hinduism, or whatever, and I know the door and say, "Hey, you have to become Islamic. This is the one. Hey, this is the one. Hey, this is the one."

I start to move my ego into the others. I'm not looking for my own enlightenment. I am pushing the others toward mine. Each time you are seeking for something—not just spirituality, whatever—you are looking for anything of you. It makes you happy or whatever. What you are trying to reach is egoism. It is selfish, and it is not bad. You are looking for it for yourself. You are not pushing anybody to do what you believe is good.

Get rid of the moral and the cultural aspects of the aim. Just be yourself.

### Egoism vs. Egocentrism

This is what we have to acknowledge. What we are doing in this path—the question would be: what we are doing, is it that we want to transform ourselves to help others just by allowing them to see that I am changing, or that I want to change everyone?

According to the example I did, the egoism touches with egocentrism. Egocentrism means I am the center of everything. Imagine you go to a religion and you think this is the one. I pick it, and I say, "This is the center. This is my truth. I am the center of everything."

It touches with egoism when it tries to go to the others to say, "This is the center."

### Preaching vs. Egoism

Someone who is preaching—for example, preaching is not equal to egoism. For example, the Jehovah's Witnesses go to your house, and they just want to share their wisdom, their knowledge, their faith with everyone. They are meant to do that. But that doesn't make them selfish or with egoism. What they're doing is just sharing their love to their religion. They are not forcing you to think like them. They are just trying to share, to make you question.

So it's not the same. It would be different if they open the door and say, "Hey, you have to be like us, or you will go to hell or whatever." Maybe some of them do; I don't know. Mostly, they are not like that. They are just preaching their truth. That is totally different from egoism.

Of course, we can speak hours about this, but I just wanted to share the main concepts and ideas.

### The Creator and the Creation

The code of today teaches us that the "I Am," the sense of contemplation, becomes aware of everything it has projected. All that created corresponds directly to the culture—the creator is directly a reflection of its creations. The "I" resonates like the echoes of fatality, creating the science, the posings of the dream, the awakened.

This is like "I Am" the creator, and I create everything. Everything begins to create myself. The cycle today is about recognizing that everything around us is a projection of ourselves, and we are also a reflection of what we create.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Reflect on your own ego and recognize it as a tool for evolution and creation. Observe the different perspectives you move through in your life, like the seasons. Notice when you are being egoistic (seeking for yourself) versus egocentric (making yourself the center and pushing others). Practice balancing your ego by honoring both the "I" (creative) and the "Am" (wisdom).

### Applying This Teaching

When you encounter teachings that tell you to eliminate the ego, remember that the ego is necessary for creation and experience. Instead of trying to destroy it, work on balancing it. Recognize that everything you create is a reflection of you, and you are a reflection of everything around you. Use this understanding to bring coherence to your self and your creations.

## Q&A

### Q: Why is the ego necessary if many teachings say to eliminate it?

The ego is the tool through which the divine creates and experiences reality. Without ego, there is no perspective, no creation. Those who say to eliminate it have already worked deeply with it and found balance. For most of us, the work is to balance the ego, not destroy it.

### Q: What is the difference between egoism and egocentrism?

Egoism is the movement of the self toward different perspectives to seek and create for yourself. It is not bad. Egocentrism is when the ego forgets its center and tries to make itself the center everywhere, pushing others to accept your truth as theirs.

### Q: How does the ego work like the Earth's axis?

The ego is like the Earth's axis, which creates the seasons by moving through different perspectives. Egoism is the healthy movement through spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The problem arises when the ego stops moving and tries to be only one season constantly.

### Q: Is it bad to seek spirituality for myself?

No. Seeking spirituality, happiness, or any goal for yourself is egoism, and it is not bad. You are looking for your own enlightenment and evolution. The problem arises when you push others to follow your path or accept your truth as theirs.

### Q: What is the relationship between the creator and creation?

The creator is directly a reflection of its creations. Everything you create is a reflection of who you are, and you are also a reflection of everything you create. This is the symbiotic relationship between the "I" and the "Am."

### Q: How do I balance my ego?

By recognizing it as a tool and honoring both the creative aspect ("I") and the wisdom aspect ("Am"). Work with the ego to find coherence, allowing it to move through different perspectives without forgetting its center.

### Q: Is preaching the same as egocentrism?

No. Preaching is sharing your truth and inviting others to question and explore. Egocentrism is forcing others to accept your truth as the only truth and making yourself the center of everything.

### Q: What does "I Am the Life in All Things" mean?

It means recognizing that the self, the ego, is connected to everything around it. Everything you experience, create, and encounter is a reflection of you, and you are a reflection of it all. You are the life expressing itself in all forms.
