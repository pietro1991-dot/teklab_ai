## Introduction

Good morning , good afternoon , good evening everyone.

So today I am in a different place because I would be in this place for a long time because there is something happening here so they have to change me into another place.

So I am better here really but this would be my home for the next month.

So today I have been moving in the whole day.

So I hope you were able today to read the blog so you can have kind of an idea. During the moving I just found the green one and the black one.

So I have no idea where are the rest. Maybe in some box around but I will try to find them tomorrow.

So I will I will use this to today.

## Energy Work

So remember that we are in the month of Capricorn during the week of the mental , the mind. We are today with the topic of the law of generation related to the root chara.

So let 's begin with the topic for today which is the law of generation. Let 's go first to the meaning of the word. For us generation is to create things to generate something. To do something outside.

But the origin of the word in Greek language is jin. Which is jin. And jin comes from the word it means origin. And also this comes from the in the European language which is also jin.

That means to give birth.

So that 's the meaning to give birth.

So all the words that today we use like jin or jin.

So jin they 're all this all this words are coming from jin.

Okay from from this word. As you see we today use the word jin for many things as important to know the origin of the word. Because now we can use it in a different way with a different idea. For example today we are speaking a lot about the ideology of gender.

But when we understand the origin of the word gender is not related to what do you think about your sexuality is about your origin from where you come from , which is related with jin 's.

So it 's not about the idea of what you feel about sexuality is about the origin of where you come from.

So now we can understand that when we say ideology of gender it 's weird because the same word is saying that it 's not an ideology. It comes from the biology of the origin. For example we have also the history of the origin that we know of jin 's is. Also we have the concepts of being unique and special that we call jin , or jin use.

And also the origin of the group of people that we call there 's no world. English practice. People people in Spanish is hindi that comes from that word.

So regarding the law of generation , I , I spoke today in part. Regarding the idea of God being the one that generates the things , being the origin of all the things.

So I will take here something very simple. This is God. That is God , the unique.

So God is basically this vacuum where all the things emerge.

So this center of darkness , of vacuum is the point from the energy emerges to create the race of light and everything that is around which is this space.

So that 's why this is where we are the origin.

So God , the divine is a constant vacuum that is original. I do n't know if you have seen this , but in a different way than we have begin the other laws that were created by the waves and so on. This is the seventh law. And even though I am already speaking about it and I had n't even begin to create the other ones.

So I repeat again.

The reason why we divide the seven laws of the universe in this seventh steps is because our mind needs to be to put an order in a line to understand a process that happens in the infinite with no end and no beginning.

So I do n't know if you know why to God they used to call it alpha and omega. Because the BC of Greece , in terms of Greece they said that God was the Holy Word.

So the BC that begin with the letter A which is and end with the letter O which is omega. They said this is the whole cycle of creation. God is the cycle of circle.

So it begins and end constantly.

So that 's why they call it the alpha and omega.

So today for us would be called the A and the Z. But for the Greeks , the last one was the Po.

So this divine is the alpha and omega.

So the alpha is the mind and the omega is the generation. We call it the last one of the laws on being created. But this one close the cycle. Again.

So that 's why it begins again. It comes back to the origin.

So generation is the beginning and the end of all the things. But the generation means that the gene , the origin is the beginning and the end.

So this takes us this idea. That for the universe , it does n't really exist at the beginning or end. Because in a circle like this is impossible to define where it begins and where it ends. It 's a constant cycle.

So there 's no beginning and no end. It 's constant.

Remember this is a constant sequence.

So mentality is the only thing that exists in the whole universe.

So when the mentality of the cosmos expands to the outside by correspondence. From that moment on , the mentality will be called generation. See you. And the reason why generation starts to be the main one is because once it polarized itself , the joints of this polarity will be a new origin.

So this origin starts to repeat once and again.

So that origin we call cos. And the result of this cos is called effect.

So in order to have different causes with the different effects , why we will need is to have or violate different vibrations with different rhythms. Do you see how it 's impossible to separate the universe a lot? If it 's impossible to separate them because all of them are this. It 's only one thing.

As you see , once the mind projected itself outside , everything that happened after that will be a reflection of the original idea , which this means generation.

So this means that anything that could happen afterwards would be just an ocean and reflection of the original idea.

So the whole picture is that everything is in mind generating an idea which is generation. That projects into the outside by correspondence , creating the polarity by these correspondent from the inside and the outside. And this polarity creates a middle point in the axis which is another idea of generation. That is a cos and this cos will create an effect that will bring this generation.

And the way you can transform a cos to create a different is by changing your vibration and the speed of the rhythms. I hope you get it because I do n't know if there is another way to make a summary of this. Let 's go to the next.

Okay , for those who have been religious or rice apples at religious person , we will call this point God or for those who are not religious , we will call it the origin. Here there is only mind. The mind projects from the internal to the external from the negative to the positive.

So in this moment is when we leave the big band , the great explosion.

So here we come back to the negative and we leave the elements.

So we have all the chemical elements. Chemistry. Then we project them creating axis. Then we go again to create worlds.

We can back again to create life.

So we go down again to create evolution. And we come back again to create an individual.

So from this breathing in of this being that is thinking about itself. The big band appears in the outside. And this big band is the one joining the vibrations and energy creating the chemical elements. And the energy oxygen , hydrogen etc.

From the chemical elements , they start to get together creating the galaxies , the suns , the stars. After the galaxies around the suns and the stars we have the worlds. And the worlds are those who does n't have their own light so they reflect the light. These worlds through the combination , the new combinations of the chemical elements appear live.

And from life begins the path of evolution which is the different paths , histories that make themselves transform through time. And this is what generates a conscience individual. And this individual will live different lives with different experiences.

So there comes the day when the individual becomes aware that it is also capable to generate through the mind.

So this being through the mind says , okay , I am the creator now.

So I transformed the individual that I am. I begin a new path of evolution through the inside. I change my life. I compare new worlds.

I go and expand the galaxies within and outside. I accomplish to transform the elements the chemical elements to make out-coming. From this out-coming I come back to the origin of all the material things.

So I can become God again. As you see , each one of these , of this bus here is a gene.

So another origin.

So this path going there , we call it , I 'm mine. And this path coming back is called I am. Let 's see it in another way. We have here some weird people sharing together.

And all of these here are original beings.

So this means that all of them have a self. And I refer to themselves.

So each one of us , each one of you , you are an original. Because each one of us has an origin , each one of us has a different attribute of the origin.

So that 's why we say you have to awake the individual , the self of yourself. You have to awake your originality. We used to save these things. Then we have to come back to the one itself of each one of us.

And all of these beings are connected one another through a network. And we have the same system. But remember that in the universe only one thing. We are looking forward to it.

So we believe that I am. But what happened when we do this? What do you think about this? This is a cosmic brochure of people , cosmic , cosmic , Prose of people.

Do you know this stick that you put different things , spoon and you put it? Do you see these two waves , the positive wave , the negative wave? For the universe , this is a spiral. They are the chapters.

Okay? Charts. And this line we see here is the same dots that we see in these people. But without separation from the point of view of unity.

This is eternal. It 's not just an eternal. And has thousands and thousands of curling shapes like the NA when it creates a chromosome.

So all this interaction of individuals is like a chromosome of God. I say I am original. It 's true. Because I come from the original.

I come from the origin. But each one of us is in a different symphony.

So each one of this will be unique.

So this will be original. Being musician. This one would be original being doctor. This would be original being an artist.

This would be a reasonable being a loving lover. This would be original being a teacher , whatever.

So this means that in different symphonies , we all have originality. This is why we all have to be different. This is why we all have to be unique. Because if we are not unique , if we do all the same things , there 's no evolution.

We were said that we have to come back to the origin , to the origin , that we have to the main origin of everything , but through our own originality. This is where we call , on-back to the Again. And this is why the only way we can really connect with the self is by generating , is by generating things , generating life , generating projects , generating ideas , generating things. Generating trust with doing something.

That 's the way in which we connect with the origin that goes through all of us. The whole universe is connected to the origin , and this is why to connect with the universe , you have to originate things. This is the law of generation in between so many other things. And if this was not really well understood , so maybe you need to look for another originals that shows you different ways to reach this information.

And go deeper into it.

## Daily Practice Elements

So information for today. The vibration for today is yo. The statement for today is I am the stare of experience. The code for today is divinity.

Is the quality of being related to God , from the word , dius and devi. Is the concept that comprises everything related to with God or a God? The concept itself might be that if everything originates in the sense of the cosmos , and we are simply projections of the origin of the creator , then divinity lives in us. For that , in all the ancient civilizations , they honoured so many divinities.

Or it was no that every being had a divine aspect for every being direct products of universe.

So let 's go to the alignment.

So seed comfortable and focus on your breathing. And take deep breath. And take deep breath. The time to come aware of the environment that surrounds you.

With my imagination , I 've started to design around me a library. And fall with books and different gallons. I recognize that all this books are patterns and information within my subconscious. This library is my own educational records.

And I am the only librarian. I recognize that I am here to look for some information that allow me become much more aware of my capacity to generate. To look into this library. For the pattern , I is not allowing me to be original and to generate my own reality.

I am jumping to these galleries full of books. I am feeling which one of them is calling me. When I find it , I take it between my hands and write it nonsense. I am going to the main hall.

I go to the main hall of serving in front of me the stairs of my unconscious. And to the office , filled with light with clarity of my conscious. I set the intention to go out through the stairs of my consciousness. With all my experience through the existence.

I am willing to reach the consciousness to bring clarity to this pattern that is not allowing me to be original. Without expectations. With making any strength , no judgment. I open the book and let myself receive this data , this information of the pattern that is talking me from to generate my life.

I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original.

I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original.

I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original.

I have served the stairs , not too clean to be what I am today. Here all experiences. I am the stair of experiences. I am the stair to experiences.

I am the stair to experiences. I am the stair to experience the experience of the stairs. I am the stair to experience the experience of the stairs. I remember that after we came back , we have to write down all these steps.

All these steps have been done. I have worked with ourselves. In order to wait for this information , I started to stretch the body and bring these consciousness to a place where we are stretching and going. I am not allowing me to be original.

I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original. I am not allowing me to be original.
