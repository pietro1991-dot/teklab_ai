## Overview

On January 7th, we explore the Law of Generation—the seventh and final Hermetic principle. Matias teaches that **generation is both the beginning and the end.** It's the alpha and the omega, the origin that closes the cycle and begins it again.

The word "generation" comes from the Greek **"gen"** (origin) and the Indo-European **"gen"** (to give birth). **To generate is to originate.** It's to bring something new into existence while carrying the essence of the source.

This teaching reveals a profound truth: **the seventh law is also the first law.** Generation closes the circle back to Mentality. The mind projects itself outward (correspondence), and everything that follows is a reflection of the original idea—which is generation. **The whole universe is God generating an idea, projecting it, and returning to the origin.**

---

## Core Teaching

### The Origin of the Word "Generation"

The word "generation" has powerful roots.

In Greek, it comes from **"gen,"** which means **origin.**

In Indo-European languages, it comes from **"gen,"** which means **to give birth.**

**To generate is to originate.** To create. To bring forth.

All words related to origin come from this root:
- **Genesis** (the beginning, the origin story)
- **Genius** (unique and special, original)
- **Genealogy** (the origin of a family line)
- **Gender** (not about sexuality, but about origin—where you come from biologically)

**Generation is about origin.** It's about where things come from, and how they continue.

### Gender: Not Ideology, But Origin

Matias clarifies something important about the word "gender."

Today, people use "gender" to talk about ideology and identity. But the **origin of the word "gender" is biological.** It comes from "gen"—origin.

**Gender is not about what you think about your sexuality.** It's about the biological origin of where you come from.

So when people say "gender ideology," it's contradictory—because the word itself means **biological origin,** not ideology.

This is important to understand the word correctly.

### God as the Origin: The Center of Darkness

Matias draws a simple image: **God is the center of darkness.**

**God is the vacuum—the point from which energy emerges.** The center is dark, empty, void. From this vacuum, energy explodes outward, creating light, creating the universe, creating the space around it.

**This is the origin.** This is where everything comes from.

**God is not the light. God is the vacuum from which the light emerges.**

### The Seventh Law Is Also the First

Here's where it gets profound:

**The seventh law (Generation) is actually the first law.**

Why?

Because **Mentality (the first law) is the only law.** It holds all the others. The other six laws are aspects within Mentality.

When the mind projects itself outward (correspondence), **that projection is Generation.** The mind generates the universe.

**So Generation is the beginning and the end.** It's the alpha and the omega.

### Alpha and Omega: The Cycle Has No Beginning or End

The Greeks called God **"Alpha and Omega"**—the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet.

**Why?** Because they believed **God is the Holy Word.** The alphabet (from Alpha to Omega) represents the whole cycle of creation.

**God is the entire cycle.** It begins and ends constantly. It's a circle, not a line.

**For us, it would be A to Z.** For the Greeks, it was Alpha to Omega.

**There is no beginning. There is no end.** It's a constant cycle.

### Generation Closes the Cycle Back to Mentality

Let's see how this works:

1. **Mentality** (the only law, the mind)
2. **Correspondence** (the mind projects outward)
3. From that moment, everything that happens is **Generation**—a reflection of the original idea.

**Once the mind polarizes itself (creates duality), the joints of this polarity become a new origin.** This new origin repeats again and again.

**This origin is called "Cause."** The result of this Cause is called "Effect."

To have different Causes with different Effects, you need different **Vibrations** with different **Rhythms.**

**Do you see?** It's impossible to separate the laws. They are all one thing—**Mentality generating itself.**

### The Whole Picture: Mind Generating Everything

Here's the complete cycle:

**Everything is Mind generating an idea (Generation).**

This idea projects outward by **Correspondence** (inside to outside).

This creates **Polarity** (the split between inside and outside, positive and negative).

Polarity creates a middle point—an axis—which is another idea of **Generation.**

This is a **Cause.** This Cause creates an **Effect.**

To transform a Cause and create a different Effect, you change your **Vibration** and the speed of your **Rhythms.**

**The whole thing is one continuous flow.** You can't separate them.

### The Big Bang: Mind Projecting from Negative to Positive

In the origin, there is only **Mind.**

The Mind projects from the **negative** (internal) to the **positive** (external).

**This is the Big Bang**—the great explosion. The Mind breathing out.

After the explosion, we return to the **negative** (internal), and we create the **elements** (matter, chemistry).

**This is the breath of the universe:**
- **Inhale** (Mind thinking inward)
- **Exhale** (Big Bang, universe expanding)
- **Inhale** (elements forming, matter condensing)
- **Cycle repeats**

### The Path Out and the Path Back

**The path going outward is called "I Am Mine."**

The path coming back is called **"I Am."**

**"I Am Mine"** is the journey of individuation—becoming a unique self, an original being.

**"I Am"** is the journey of return—remembering you are also the whole, the origin, God.

**Both are necessary.** You need to become individual (Mine) AND remember you are universal (I Am).

### We Are All Original Beings

Each of us is an **original being** because each of us has an **origin.**

Each of us has a different attribute of the origin. **We are each unique expressions of the source.**

That's why people say: "Awaken the individual. Awaken the self. Awaken your originality."

**We are all connected through a network**—like a cosmic chromosome, a DNA strand of God.

But each of us is a different note in the symphony. Each of us is original in a different way:
- One is an original musician.
- One is an original doctor.
- One is an original artist.
- One is an original teacher.

**We need to be different.** If we all do the same thing, there's no evolution.

**Originality is necessary for growth.**

### The Only Way to Connect with the Origin Is by Generating

Here's the key teaching:

**The only way to truly connect with the self, with the origin, is by GENERATING.**

By generating life. Generating projects. Generating ideas. Generating trust. Generating action.

**When you generate, you connect with the origin that flows through you.**

The whole universe is connected to the origin. **To connect with the universe, you must originate things.**

**This is the Law of Generation.**

### Divinity Lives in Us

The code for today is **Divinity.**

Divinity is the quality of being related to God, from the words **"dius"** and **"devi."**

**If everything originates in the cosmos, and we are projections of the origin, then divinity lives in us.**

This is why ancient civilizations honored so many divinities. **Every being has a divine aspect** because every being is a direct product of the universe.

**You are not separate from God. You ARE an expression of God.**

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit comfortably with your spine straight.
2. Place your hand on your root chakra (base of your spine).
3. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Bring your awareness to your root chakra. This is your connection to the origin, to the Earth, to the source.

2. Imagine you are surrounded by a huge library. This is your Akashic Records—your subconscious, where all your patterns and experiences are stored.

3. Walk through the galleries of books. Each book is a pattern, an experience, a piece of information.

4. Ask yourself: **"What pattern is blocking me from being original? What is stopping me from generating my own reality?"**

5. Let yourself be called to a specific book. When you find it, take it in your hands without judgment.

6. Now, go to the main hall. In front of you, you see the stairs of your unconscious, leading up to the office of your consciousness—filled with light.

7. Set the intention to go through the stairs of your consciousness, through all your experiences in existence, to reach clarity.

8. Climb the stairs. With each step, you move through a different life, a different experience. Each step is evolution.

9. Repeat as you climb: **"I Am the Stairs of Experiences."**

10. **"I Am the Stairs of Experiences."**

11. **"I Am the Stairs of Experiences."**

12. Reach the office of light at the top. You are surrounded by clarity.

13. Open the book. See the pattern that has been blocking you from being original.

14. Without judgment, bring this information to your third eye. Let the light transform the pattern into a tool.

15. Recognize: **this pattern is not a limitation. It's a tool I can now use consciously.**

16. Bring the book to your root chakra. Feel the pattern integrate into your body.

17. Say: **"I am original. I generate my own life. I am a direct product of the universe."**

18. Take a deep breath. Bring your awareness back to your root.

### Closing

1. Stretch your body gently.
2. Open your eyes slowly.
3. Write down what you discovered about the pattern blocking your originality.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Ask yourself: "What am I generating in my life? What am I creating?" If the answer is "nothing," or "I'm just repeating old patterns," then it's time to generate something new. Create a project. Build an idea. Manifest a dream. The only way to connect with your origin is by being original—by generating.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel stuck or disconnected, remember: **you are not here to repeat what others have done. You are here to generate something original.** Your uniqueness is not a flaw; it's your divine purpose. Generate. Create. Bring forth. This is how you connect with the origin flowing through you.

## Q&A

### Q: What does "generation" really mean?

Generation comes from "gen" (origin) and means "to give birth." It's the act of bringing something new into existence while carrying the essence of the source. To generate is to originate—to create, to manifest, to bring forth.

### Q: Why is the seventh law also the first law?

Because Mentality (the first law) is the only law—it contains all the others. When the Mind projects itself outward (correspondence), that projection IS generation. So generation is both the beginning (the origin) and the end (the completion of the cycle). It's the alpha and omega.

### Q: What does "alpha and omega" mean?

It's the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. The Greeks called God "alpha and omega" because they believed God is the Holy Word—the entire cycle of creation from beginning to end. But since it's a circle, there is no beginning or end. It's constant.

### Q: How is the Big Bang related to generation?

The Big Bang is the Mind (God) projecting from negative (internal, vacuum) to positive (external, light). It's the great exhale—the breath of the universe creating everything. After the expansion, the universe inhales, creating elements and matter. This breath is generation—the constant cycle of creation.

### Q: What does "I Am Mine" vs. "I Am" mean?

"I Am Mine" is the path outward—individuation, becoming a unique self, awakening your originality. "I Am" is the path inward—returning to the source, remembering you are the whole, reconnecting with God. Both are necessary. You must become individual AND remember you are universal.

### Q: How do I connect with my origin?

By GENERATING. Create something. Build a project. Manifest an idea. Generate life, generate action, generate trust. When you generate, you connect with the origin flowing through you. The universe is always creating—when you create, you align with that flow.

### Q: What does "originality" really mean?

Originality means expressing your unique attribute of the source. You are an original being because you have a different symphony to play than anyone else. Your uniqueness is your divine purpose. Be original—not by copying others, but by generating from your own essence.

### Q: How does divinity live in us?

If everything originates from the cosmos, and we are projections of the origin, then divinity lives in us. We are not separate from God—we ARE expressions of God. Every being is a direct product of the universe. You are divine by nature.
