# Day 214 - The Fourth Dimension: Time as Transformation

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Heart
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Mental Week
- **Main Topic:** The Fourth Dimension - Time, Process, Transformation, and the Astral Planes
- **Vibration:** `Mi`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Portal of Heart`
- **Code:** Growth - connected with experimentation on earth's summer. The growth is the learning process of trial and error that is projected on the first four septennials of life. The first septennial goes from the first year till the seventh year of life (physical body, motor skills). The second septennial of growth is the emotional one that goes from the eighth till the fourteenth year of life. The third one develops the mind and finishes by shaping the way we see the world from year 15 till 21. The fourth septennial from twenty-two till twenty-eight years of life will take place the unification and balance process of the three bodies: mental, emotional, and physical.

## Overview

We have explored the first dimension (polarity), the second dimension (imagination and design), and the third dimension (depth and physical matter). Today we enter the **fourth dimension**—time.

For centuries, people have tried to describe the fourth dimension as the place where unexplainable things happen, where dreams occur, where we go when we die. The spiritual world has called it the **astral planes**—lower astral, medium astral, higher astral.

But the fourth dimension is not exactly a "place" in the stars, separate from this one. It is not a destination you travel to. The fourth dimension is **time itself**—the process through which things transform.

This teaching connects to the **heart chakra**, the center that holds all dimensions together, the axis between heaven and earth, the balance point where energy flows inward and outward. The heart is where we experience transformation, where we hold past and future in the eternal present, where death and birth meet as one continuous process.

Today we discover that **things do not move through time**. Things **transform because of time**. We learn that death is not an ending but an expansion, that the soul does not leave the body but **expands from within it**, and that all transformation is the same structure—spirit, soul, and body—turning itself inside-out like a sock, eternally renewing.

## What is the Fourth Dimension?

### Not a Separate Place

Even though today we name the fourth dimension as the place where we find the astral planes, we have to know this is just a **cultural name**. "Astral" is how ancient people named all invisible things—things not attached to the physical world were called "those things that are with the stars."

The fourth dimension is not related to the stars in the literal sense. It is a **human point of view** from cultures that believed every person who dies goes into the heavens with the stars.

The fourth dimension is not a different place from this one. It is something we know but **do not know how it works**.

### Time: The Dimension of Process

The fourth dimension is **time**.

Knowing that the fourth dimension is time, we must understand that this dimension is related to the **process of things**, not the things themselves.

**Things** are objects in the third dimension. **Process** is the fourth dimension.

We as humans perceive time as a line we are moving through, as if we are traveling along a timeline. But **it is not like this**.

Things are not moving through time. **Things transform themselves through time, because of time.**

## How the Fourth Dimension Works: Fractalization Through Time

### Expanding the Cube

Remember: the first dimension projects into the second dimension. The second dimension fractalized creates the third dimension (the vanishing point creating depth).

Now the third dimension fractalized creates the fourth dimension.

Imagine a cube. This cube in the third dimension can **expand itself outward**, getting wider, creating another cube the same size beside it, and going out, expanding itself.

If we unite all the vertices of these expanding cubes, we create a **sphere**. This is how a cell divides—the chromosomes replicate themselves, creating a new cell.

When we see cells dividing, they are projecting themselves into others, creating new ones. This happens not only in humans but in the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, and the animal kingdom.

### The Tesseract: A Cube in the Fourth Dimension

This expanding structure is called a **tesseract**—a cube in the fourth dimension. If the structure were a tetrahedron instead of a cube, it would have a different name, but the principle is the same.

The tesseract shows us that **matter is going through a process**, and this process is transformation through time.

For example:
- In minerals: a salt cube replicates into another salt cube, then another, until they create a salt mountain.
- In vegetables and animals: cells divide, replicate, multiply.

This describes the **process of transformation of matter**, which happens **through time**.

Time is not something separate from space, from things. **Time is an aspect of the physical object during transformation.**

---

## Transformation is Constant

### We Are Always Changing

Imagine that this constant transformation happens in our lives. First we are two cells, then a fetus, then a baby, then a child, then a teenager, then an adult. We keep changing.

But not only as we grow up—**every day we are changing**. Every day, thousands and billions of cells die and thousands and billions are born again in our body. They are constantly transforming our body.

This means **time is constantly changing us**.

Every six months to one year, we become physically a new person. All our cells are new (except neurons). We are not the same body. We are information replicating itself.

The reason we remain similar is because cells are **transmitting the same information**. But like gossip, the message gets distorted. One cell tells another, which tells another, and the information slightly changes. This is how we age, how we slowly lose the exact same shape and form.

### Cells After Death

When we die, the cells do not disappear. **The cells keep transforming.**

Some cells replicate for many years after we die (like hair and nails). Other cells become food for insects, for animals. We spread and become different things. The cells keep becoming new ones in different bodies, in different things, in different energy forms.

**The body never ends. It keeps transforming.**

What really happens is that the energy **expands** into different other cells, in different other cubes.

---

## Death: The Expansion of Energy

### Spirit, Soul, Body as Nested Cubes

Imagine three cubes, one inside the other:
- The innermost cube is the **spirit** (essence).
- The middle cube is the **soul** (energy).
- The outermost cube is the **body** (matter).

They are not separate. They are **extensions of each other**, the same being at different scales.

### Turning Inside-Out

When we die, what happens?

The inner cube **opens itself through the nodes, expands, and takes place on the outside**. The body is still there—it did not disappear. But an internal part **expanded to the outside**.

It is like **turning a sock inside-out**. The inside becomes the outside. The outside becomes the inside.

Now imagine each cube has an attribute:
- The **spirit** (core) is the essence.
- The **soul** is the energy.
- The **body** is the matter.

When the body dies, the **energy expands**. The soul, which was compressed inside, expands outward. The core of essence expands even wider outside the energy.

It is like the image turns completely opposite, upside down. Now the body is here, the soul is here, the spirit is here. Somehow the spirit manages to become the essence again, and the body goes out and takes place again covering the whole thing, and they create the same structure again—**and you are alive**.

But it does not get bigger. It is just the same size. They only go out and transform.

### Nothing Really Dies

The essence, the energy, and the matter **never finish**. They are constant. They are the same thing, and they are eternal in the universe. They are always here—all three of them.

The only thing that really changes is that **they transform**. They change position, shape. That is the only thing that happens.

**Nobody really dies. Everything is really transforming itself.**

There is no separation between all things. It is all the same, but **transforming itself constantly**.

---

## The Astral Planes: States of Vibration

### Projecting Your Inner State

So if the soul, the energy, expands from within to the outside when we die, what is happening is that everything that was compressed inside **comes into the outside being expanded**.

This means the reality that will be projected on the outside (in the fourth dimension) will be **directly in the same proportion as the one I had within**.

**In the moment we expand into the fourth dimension, the fourth dimension takes the shapes of what we have within.**

If we are bearing a low vibration, we expand in a very low vibration. If we are in a high vibration, we expand in a positive vibration.

- If I believe in hell, I will expand in hell.
- If I believe in heaven, I will expand in heaven.
- If I believe in Buddhism, I will expand in Buddha.
- If I believe in Christ, I will expand in Christ.
- If I believe in nothing, I will expand in nothing.

Depending on the **state of vibration** I have throughout my life, I will project this reality according to my life.

### Beings in the Fourth Dimension

In the same way we have our point of view of the fourth dimension, projecting it out there, in the fourth dimension there are **beings that only live through time**.

They experience time in the same way as we experience matter in space. Those beings can **mold themselves according to the process**. They can decide whether it is past or future, but they cannot be the matter.

We can handle and mold matter, but we cannot mold time. Beings in the fourth dimension can mold time, but they cannot mold and handle matter.

### Ghosts: Attached to Matter

People who are really attached to matter project their attachment when they die. When the cells say "we need to expand," these people project the matter they are living in and attached to.

Because of this, they project their lives again. That is what we call a **ghost**.

Ghosts are people who projected themselves attached to their lives. Because in the fourth dimension there is **no time as we know it**, time can be eternity. But for those people, eternity is lived differently—maybe only one week passes for them, not a thousand years.

### Lower, Medium, and Higher Astral

This is what separates the **lower astral**, **medium astral**, and **high astral**. These three levels are **not related to the stars** as the name implies. They are related to the **state of vibration** of the people that expand.

Someone from the third dimension can expand into the fourth dimension. Someone from the fourth dimension can contract toward the third dimension. **That is what we call being born.**

## Connecting the Dimensions: Metatron's Cube

### The Nodes That Connect

Spirit, soul, and body—how are they connected to one another? By **nodes**—the vertices where the cubes meet.

These nodes expand from one another. What do these nodes remind you of? **Chakras**.

These nodes are basically chakras, organized in a specific way.

What happens if these chakras are **not connected**? The whole structure starts to be **imbalanced**. There is no connection, there is imbalance.

When the nodes are not aligned, they are **open to anything** because they are not in harmony.

### Demons, Parasites, and Angels

This explains why from the fourth dimension there are beings that live through the energy of others—**parasites**. Also **possessions**. Many beings we know from the fourth dimension are called **demons**, and they are energetic parasites.

**Angels too** are beings from the fourth dimension.

All these beings enter our reality using our energy **if we are not in balance**.

This is why many people say: "Don't open portals, or be afraid of energetic portals, because anything can get inside those portals."

The only reason something wrong can get inside these portals is if someone opening the portal is **imbalanced**.

### Manifesting Through Balance

If instead of being imbalanced, I am **in balance**, I can manifest my dreams.

The fourth dimension is the one that **allows me to manifest**.

If I am in balance, I can go inside the fourth dimension, I can see all the possibilities of time, and **contract one of those possibilities to manifest it in the third dimension**.

The only way I can protect myself from negative beings is by being **coherent** between what I think, what I feel, and what I do.

When I have the nodes of the tesseract aligned, I have **Metatron's Cube**—the structure that allows me to get into the possibilities of time to manifest them into space, and above all, to get inside the fourth dimension **without fear**.

## Do Not Jump to the Fifth Dimension

### Integration is Required

Do not try to jump into the fifth dimension.

The only way to go into the fifth dimension is through the **integration of the fourth and the third**.

Remember: dimensions are not places. They are not floors of a building. You cannot get inside the fifth dimension by jumping through the window of the fifth floor.

You need to **integrate the third and the fourth** in order to reconnect. The connection between the third and the fourth **is** the fifth.

The only way you can make the connection of the fifth is through the other two.

### Your Own Way

How do I do it? How can I manifest from the fourth dimension to the third?

Remember: **each one of you has your own tesseract**. Each one of you has your own way.

Some of you will do it through music. Some through science. Some through art.

You have to figure out the way. The way you will do it is by **being centered in yourself**.

There is no method for everyone to do this. **The only way is to be.**

So you just have to **be**. And that is it.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing. Take a deep breath and become aware of your body and the place you find yourself in now.

### Expanding the Space

Take a deep breath, and with your imagination, expand the place you are in—expand the room toward the infinite, expanding the roof, the floor, the walls in every direction, disappearing toward the infinite, still surrounded by the universal void.

### Recognizing the Dimensions

Recognize the **axis of your first dimension**, connecting upper and down through the spine and down up—your positive and negative.

Recognize the **shape, the human figure**, of your second dimension.

Take a deep breath and become aware of the **depth of your physical body** in the third dimension.

### Seeing Through Time

Take a deep breath and become aware of **all the things you have been, you are, and you will be** as this individual, as this being here and now, through the time of the fourth dimension.

### Meeting Your Past and Future

Imagine now that inside of you there is a tinier version of yourself—a smaller version that starts to multiply toward the inside with another one smaller, another one even smaller, and so on, until they disappear in the core of your heart toward eternity.

Imagine now a version of yourself appears bigger than you, holding you inside. Another one holding you both, expanding, another one bigger inside, another one even bigger, multiplying toward the entire infinite toward the eternity of the cosmos.

Recognize that **toward the inside** you find every version of what you have been in the past, and **toward the outside** all the versions of who you may become in the future.

You are here and now, the physical version of yourself in the third dimension, and all the rest—all the other versions from the past and the future—are the ones living in the fourth dimension.

### Looking Within and Without

Take a look **within**, recognizing that each one of these versions is even younger, going toward the past, looking into each one of the processes you have been through—even before you were born, when you were just a seed, when you were a spirit, and before, in other worlds and realities. All of them are versions of yourself, of your own history.

Take a breath and take a look to the **future**, outside, expanded to the cosmos, toward the versions of yourself that you have yet to become in this life, in other lives, in other worlds, in entire universes.

**You are all of them, and all of them connect to you through the heart, through the axis of love.**

### The Vibration Mi

You are all of them, connecting and holding in harmony.

**I Am all of them, connecting and holding in harmony.**  
**I Am all of them, connecting and holding in harmony.**  
**I Am all of them, connecting and holding in harmony.**

Sound the vibration **Mi**, and feel it resonating in your heart.

**I Am love in everyone. I Am love in everyone. I Am love in everyone.**

### Manifesting the Future

**I believe—this that I believe is what I create.**

Extend your arms to that version of yourself in which you believe, which you intend to become, and bring it to your heart in order to **be**.

**I believe.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and expand the awareness of consciousness here and now, coming back slowly.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, practice **seeing yourself through time**. Look at old photographs of yourself as a child, a teenager, a young adult. Recognize that all those versions still exist within you in the fourth dimension.

Then, imagine your future self—one year, five years, ten years from now. What version of yourself are you becoming? Extend your heart's energy to that future version and **bring it into your present** by embodying it now.

Practice coherence: align what you think, what you feel, and what you do. This alignment is the key to manifesting from the fourth dimension into the third.

### Applying This Teaching

When you experience loss or death of a loved one, remember: they have not disappeared. They have **expanded**. Their energy, essence, and matter continue transforming. They are not gone; they are **everywhere**.

When you feel stuck in your life, remember: you are not moving through time; you are **transforming because of time**. Each moment is an opportunity to replicate yourself into a new version, to fractalize toward a new possibility.

When you fear death, remember: death is not an ending but a **turning inside-out**, an expansion from the compressed interior to the infinite exterior. What you hold within will become what you experience without.

Cultivate balance, coherence, and love. These are the keys to navigating the fourth dimension with clarity and peace.

## Week Context

We are in the **Mental Week of Pisces**, understanding dimensions through the mind. We have learned that dimensions are measurements (Day 211), explored imagination and design in the second dimension (Day 212), discovered physical reality as fractalized illusion in the third dimension (Day 213), and today we explored **time as transformation** in the fourth dimension.

Pisces teaches us about unity, dissolution, and the continuous flow of existence. The fourth dimension embodies this perfectly: nothing ends, everything transforms, and all separations are illusions created by our limited perception of time.

Tomorrow we explore the **fifth dimension**—the unity of time and space, the dimension of consciousness, where guides and masters exist as reflections of our higher selves.

## Q&A

### Q: If I change every six months, am I still the same person?

You are the **same information** replicating through new cells. Your essence, your consciousness, your accumulated experience remains continuous even though the physical structure changes. Like a river: the water is always new, but the river remains the river.

### Q: What happens to people who don't believe in anything when they die?

They expand into their inner state, which is neutrality or emptiness. This can be peaceful (if they were at peace) or confusing (if they were lost). Belief shapes experience, but so does the **state of vibration** you cultivated through life. A kind atheist may have a more harmonious expansion than a fearful believer.

### Q: How can I balance my chakras to protect myself from negative beings in the fourth dimension?

Through **coherence**: align your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Practice honesty, integrity, and self-awareness. Meditate on each chakra, clearing blockages. Live in alignment with your truth. When your nodes are connected, your energy field is strong and closed to parasitic influence.

### Q: Can I visit the fourth dimension while alive?

You already do, every moment. You are **always** in the fourth dimension because you are always transforming through time. Conscious access comes through practices like meditation, lucid dreaming, astral projection, and deep coherence. But remember: you are never separate from it.

### Q: What is Metatron's Cube?

It is the geometric structure formed when the chakras (nodes) are aligned and connected, creating a balanced tesseract. It represents the **integration of all dimensions** through you. When you embody Metatron's Cube, you can navigate time and space consciously, manifesting from potential into reality.

### Q: If I'm imbalanced, how do I become balanced?

Start with awareness. Notice where you are fragmented—where your thoughts contradict your feelings, where your actions contradict your values. Practice **coherence** in small ways: speak truthfully, act with integrity, feel your emotions honestly. Balance is not perfection; it is **integration**.

### Q: Does everyone become a ghost if they're attached to matter?

No. Attachment alone doesn't create a ghost. It is **extreme attachment combined with inability to expand** that creates the ghost phenomenon. Most people, even if attached, naturally expand into the fourth dimension because the body's energy knows how to release. Ghosts are exceptions, not the rule.
