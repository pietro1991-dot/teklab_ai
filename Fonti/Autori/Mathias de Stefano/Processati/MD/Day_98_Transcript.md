# Day 98 - Crisis: Transformation Through Breaking Points

## Daily Practice Elements

**Vibration**: NEW  
**Statement**: "I am the expansion of time"  
**Chakra**: Knees  
**Law**: Law of the Second Dimension - Related with the concept of duality, this dimension projects two planes through which all unity is manifested: time and space. This dimension will show us that all existing things are aspects that move between these two factors that allow existence. They are lines, patterns that draw realities.

## Overview

Crisis means to divide, to separate things—it is a cut in the middle of our life where one path ends and another begins. Through our lives, we experience crisis in two different ways: as transformation or as change. Transformation is to go from one form to another, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly—a process, an evolution, an organic metamorphosis. Change, on the other hand, is fast, sudden, something you cannot process—like a caterpillar freezing suddenly in cold weather and getting stuck, unable to complete its transformation. We relate change to crisis because crisis means to cut the path in half, something outside your possibilities, outside your planning, something you had no time to prepare for.

The way we arrive at crisis is by not seeing the signals. Imagine yourself driving a car, and every kilometer you see a sign: "There is a hole in the road ahead." Then you see it every 500 meters, then every 100 meters, then there's the hole. Depending on how much attention you pay to the path, you will know when to lower your speed, when to change direction, so nothing wrong happens. But if you go fast and don't see any signs, suddenly you get straight to the hole and maybe have an accident. That's crisis—you weren't paying attention to all the signs, the signals you were receiving.

The whole universe, the whole of life, is basically a process of transformation. From the moment we are born until the moment we die, life is transformation. When people say, "I don't want to change, I want to stay secure, comfortable with this situation," everything becomes stuck. But there's a moment when life cannot hold all that energy of transformation, so it does everything in one spot—all the things you were holding during your life happen all in the same moment because you were holding them. It's like trying to throw an arrow with a bow: you pull the bow, pull the bow, but never let the arrow go. As much as you pull, suddenly the bow will break and hit your face. This is why we have crisis—by acknowledging that from the base, life is transformation, everything that is not transforming will eventually become a crisis.

## Core Teaching

### The Meaning of Crisis

Crisis means to divide, to separate things. It means a path that ends and a path that begins—a cut in the middle of our life. If we take our life like a path toward death, crisis would be this moment where you cut the path into different pieces. In each one, you change your way or path, or you just change the way in which you were walking that path. Through our lives, we live two different ways in which crisis can be: transformation or change.

### Transformation vs. Change

**Transformation** is to go from one shape into another. That's the meaning of transform. "Trans" means to go to another place, like transit—transit means to go from one place to another because "sit" means side. It means to go from one side to another. When we say "transform," it means you have a form, a shape, and you change into another shape. You transform yourself.

The example for transformation would be the caterpillar to butterfly. That's transformation—a process, an organic metamorphosis.

**Change** would be, for example, cold weather, and suddenly the caterpillar freezes and gets stuck in that state. It doesn't have the process of transformation; it just freezes. That would be change. Change is fast, something you cannot process.

This is why we relate change with crisis because crisis means to cut the path in half. This means it's something that doesn't have a process to get to, something outside your possibilities, outside your planning. You had no idea about it; you had no time to prepare yourself for what is coming up. That would be the problem of change.

### Why We Arrive at Crisis: Missing the Signs

We get into crisis because we hadn't seen the signals for that change. The way we can understand why we arrive at a crisis is like having this picture: imagine yourself driving a car. You drive the car, and every one kilometer you see a signal, a sign: "There is a hole in the road ahead." You see that repeating each kilometer, then you see it each 500 meters, then you see it again every 100 meters, then there's the hole in the ground.

Depending on how much attention you pay on the path, you will know when you have to lower your speed, to change your direction, so nothing wrong can happen. But if you just go fast and you don't see any sign, suddenly you will get straight to the hole and maybe have an accident. That's a crisis—because you weren't paying attention to all the signs, the signals that you have been receiving.

### Life Is Transformation

The image we have to understand is that the whole universe, the whole life, is basically a process of transformations. The moment we are born until the moment we die, life is transformation. Life is basically transformation. When people are saying, "I don't want to change, I want to stay secure, comfortable with this situation, and you don't want to change," everything is stuck. But there's a moment that life cannot hold all that energy of transformation, so it does everything in one spot. All the things that you were holding during your life happen all in the same moment because you were holding it.

It's like trying to throw an arrow with a bow, and you pull the bow, pull the bow, but you never let the arrow go away. So as much as you pull, suddenly the bow will break, and it will break your face. This would be basically why we have a crisis—by acknowledging that from the base, life is transformation. Everything that I am not transforming in my life, that is constantly the same, will become a crisis eventually.

### Working with Crisis and Attachments

Basically, the crisis that we are living in our lives, all the crisis that you have lived in your life, they are basically the result of a process of transformation that wasn't—that you weren't paying attention to. You have to think about your own crisis. You have to think about what you are holding in, what you're holding and you're not willing to transform in your life. That will become a crisis if you don't do it. Basically, that is how it works.

Life is to transform yourself. Remember that this is related to the chakra of the knees. Knees are the ones allowing us to be flexible in the path of life, to walk ahead. This would mean that if we don't allow ourselves to transform, they will break. Because when we have to move forward, if we are not able to move our knees, they will break.

### Humanity's Current Crisis

Basically, this is why our society, humanity, is like this right now. Because humans hadn't been responsible through so long that all the karma is just coming now all together. The reason why we are living all this now is because we are really close to starting a new path in our history. But we are not going to be able to start that path if we don't go through the crisis we put ourselves through. We still have like two years more of this karma that will be very heavy. Two years more in which we have to purge ourselves with all this karma within.

We have to heal this crisis that we have within and help others to try to solve it as best as possible. And from that, we can transform. We can make crisis into transformation. Crisis is an important part of our transformation, but transformation is about being organic, and crisis makes it strong and you suffer by it. Crisis is part of the system that helps, but it's not necessary—it's just a choice.

### Daily Practice: Identifying Attachments

Let's think for today: what are the things that we don't want to change in our lives? The things that we are attached to. What are those things that we don't want to change in our lives? Before you go to sleep today, try to think about what is your biggest attachment that you don't want to change in your life, so your subconscious can show you what is your next crisis.

### The Map Analogy: Finding Your Own Way

Many people ask, "How can I do this? How can I face my darkness? How can I overcome the darkness, the fears? How can I remember?" We are very used to asking "how" to teachers because when we went to school, the teachers had a handbook that says how—a manual with all the steps to do exactly what you're supposed to. Like two times two, you have one way to do it, and the teacher says, "This is the way you do it."

But life is not like that. Life is different because each one has its own way to do it. So what people like me can do is to show you the map. Here you have the map, but what you are going to do with the map—that's your thing. You have to figure that out. Imagine that I give you a map, and this map is a circle, and you have many different ways, and there are mountains and lakes in the middle. I can show you the map and the waves and the different paths and the different mountains and lakes. But how you go to the other side is your decision, how you are going to walk. If you're going to go faster or slower, if you want to climb the mountains and cross the other side, or you want to take a car, or you want to cross the lake by swimming—that's all about you.

What we are really doing here is showing the map. But the "how"—how—is only something you have to discover through your life.

### Venom Clarification: Overdose of Love

One more thing related to yesterday's topic about venom: the Snake Master said, "You are the venom, the poison of the world." Venom comes from the word love, so it's origin means love. Venom is love that has been given in mistaken doses. Like you're not giving the love in the proper doses, so it's a toxic dose. It's toxic when you have more than you're supposed to or less than you're supposed to—it's a really bad administration of your love that becomes venom. The same way in which a good thing in different doses can become venom in biology, something toxic, love also can be toxic. An overdose of love is also toxic. That's why he said you are the venom of this world. Until you are not coherent, responsible, you will be that venom because you are love. This is why when we hear this phrase, "I am all love, it's all love with me," maybe you are being toxic. You have to be aware of that.

## Practice

The meditation today takes you to the core of the Earth to become aware of all your crises—past and future—and to set the intention to transform them into conscious evolution.

**Preparation**: Sit comfortable. Begin to move your shoulders in circles to relax the tension. Let all the weight fall down, and by taking a deep breath, focus only on your breathing. Perceive all the light around you getting into your body through the skin, filling up all your inner self.

**Descent of the I Am**: Feel the light shining out and inside yourself, for you are the light. You are I Am, the higher self. Your own higher self shines above your head and gets inside your body, bringing awareness. Take a deep breath and go within your body through the crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacrum, root, knees, and ankles.

**Setting the Intention**: I desire to make all of my crisis a conscious transformation. I desire to see the signs before the crisis comes.

**Journey to the Core**: Take a deep breath and jump toward the core of the planet through the crust, through roots, soil, and rocks. Feel the heat of the magma, going faster toward the pressure of the iron core of the Earth.

**Becoming Aware of Crisis**: Become aware about all the crises that you have had, all those yet to come. Acknowledge that the pressure they put on you has been moving what you are. Set the intention to go through your history, through time, to understand all this crisis as a way for you. Set the intention from this space, from the side, to make of them your own transformation.

**Vibration**: From the core, vibrate the sound **NEW** repeatedly.

**Statement**: Repeat: "I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time."

**Return**: Take a deep breath. Bring all this consciousness through your body, shaking and stretching your body. Bring awareness to each part. Open your eyes when ready.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Tonight before sleep, ask yourself: "What is my biggest attachment that I don't want to change in my life?" Write down whatever arises. This attachment is likely where your next crisis will come from if you don't begin transforming it now. Then ask: "What signs have I been ignoring?" Often we receive signals every kilometer, every 500 meters, every 100 meters before the crisis hits—but we're not paying attention.

### Applying the Wisdom

Throughout your day, practice noticing the signs life is giving you. When something feels uncomfortable, stuck, or repetitive, that's a sign. When you keep thinking "I don't want this to change," that's a sign. When you feel the pull of the bow getting tighter and tighter, that's a sign. Don't wait for the bow to break in your face. Release the arrow. Let transformation happen organically, step by step, so that change doesn't have to be a crisis. Remember: life is transformation, and flexibility (the knees) is what allows you to keep walking forward without breaking.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the difference between transformation and change?**  
A: Transformation is to go from one form to another organically, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly—it's a process, an evolution. Change is fast, sudden, something you cannot process—like a caterpillar freezing in cold weather and getting stuck. We can relate transformation with growth, but we relate change with crisis because crisis is something outside your possibilities, outside your planning, with no time to prepare.

**Q: Why do we experience crisis?**  
A: We get into crisis because we hadn't seen the signals for change. Life gives us signs—every kilometer, every 500 meters, every 100 meters—warning us that something needs to transform. If we pay attention, we can slow down, change direction, and transform organically. But if we go fast and don't see any signs, suddenly we hit the hole and have an accident. That's crisis. It happens because we weren't paying attention to the transformation process that needed to happen.

**Q: What does it mean that "life is transformation"?**  
A: From the moment we are born until the moment we die, life is a process of transformation. The whole universe, the whole of life, is basically transformation. When people say, "I don't want to change, I want to stay secure, comfortable," everything becomes stuck. But there's a moment when life cannot hold all that transformation energy, so it explodes everything in one spot—all the things you were holding happen all at once. That's crisis. Life itself is constant transformation.

**Q: What is the bow and arrow metaphor?**  
A: It's like trying to throw an arrow with a bow. You pull the bow back, pull it back further, but you never let the arrow go. As much as you pull, eventually the bow will break and hit your face. This is why we have crisis. When you hold transformation energy back, when you refuse to change, the energy builds and builds until it explodes. If you release the arrow (allow transformation), you avoid the crisis (the bow breaking).

**Q: How do I know what will become a crisis in my life?**  
A: Think about what you are holding in, what you're not willing to transform in your life. What are your biggest attachments? What do you refuse to change? Those things will become a crisis if you don't address them. Before you go to sleep, ask your subconscious to show you your biggest attachment, so you can see what your next crisis might be and begin transforming it now instead of waiting for it to explode.

**Q: What do the knees represent?**  
A: Knees are the chakra that allows us to be flexible in the path of life, to walk ahead. If we don't allow ourselves to transform, our knees (our ability to move forward) will break. The knees represent our flexibility, our ability to adapt and transform. When we're rigid and refuse to change, we lose the ability to move forward, and that's when we break—that's when crisis hits.

**Q: Why is humanity experiencing so much crisis right now?**  
A: Because humans hadn't been responsible for so long that all the karma is coming all together now. We are really close to starting a new path in our history, but we can't start that path until we go through the crisis we put ourselves through. We have about two more years of heavy karma to purge, heal, and transform. This is humanity's collective crisis because we held back transformation for too long.

**Q: Is crisis necessary?**  
A: Crisis is an important part of transformation, but it's not necessary—it's a choice. Transformation can be organic if you pay attention to the signs and allow change to happen step by step. Crisis makes transformation strong and you suffer by it. But if you're aware, if you see the signals, if you release the arrow instead of holding the bow until it breaks, you can transform without crisis. Crisis is part of the system that helps, but it's just a choice based on whether you're paying attention.
