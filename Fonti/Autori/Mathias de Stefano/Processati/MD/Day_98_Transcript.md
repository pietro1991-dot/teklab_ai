## Introduction

Hi everyone! Good morning , we 're afternoon and good evening , good evening. I do n't know why , it means thank you so much , this too.

So today , another day , connecting with Res in the mind which.

So I would begin by trying to make a summary and idea of what our friend , the Master 's Nick , gave us yesterday. The first thing that I want to say is about why a snake master would come.

So as a reminder , we are not here doing this path to work for the light , neither the darkness. We are not here to work for unconscious or conscious. We are not here to separate path because we are here working , not working. We are here trying to acknowledge the information of the universe and how it works.

And the basis of the universe is the unity , so everything is one. And if everything is one , there is no different path.

So we are not here to work for one of those paths for different ways. We are here to understand the whole , to understand the concept of everyone together.

So this is why our space here is to work with the coherence , not with light , neither darkness.

So this is why we are open to receive the advice and information from the dark side and from the light side. That would be.

So basically what he said was related to the concept that humans , we are from the animal kingdom. And we have evolved in this world through the animal way , which is by survival , which is by the concept that we humans are that we , the animals. Our supposed to survive through eating , sleeping and feeling safe , reproduce , reproduction , also by reproduction.

So this main basics , emotions are the ones that are trying to help us to keep going to be alive. And that 's the animal way. And all these informations are ruled by the rebellion brain , which is the inner brain that we have , the oldest one , the most part of our brain. We call it the reptilian brain.

And so we live basically like animals , even if we now can think.

So what he said is , if you think correctly , humans are the ones he said that , humans are the ones rolling your life through the reptilian brain.

So you are the reptilians.

So he said , if you want to take control of the world , so be responsible and stop living through that reptilian brain. Stop blaming the other ones , because those other ones are taking care of the world until you are responsible enough to do it by yourself.

So basically the messages of this being is about responsibility. To take action to take part in it.

So I guess that 's it , because most of the message was very clear , very straight.

So thank you for those who have made it translations. And well , I guess by reading it , you can perfectly understand what he meant. I do n't know if there is something that that was n't understood , because I think was pretty clear.

## Q&A

Another thing is that I have been reading some messages asking , how can I do this? How can I face my darkness? How can I overcome the darkness , the fears , and how can I remember? And I know that we are very used to ask how to the teachers , because when we went to school , the teachers had kind of a book that says how , so it 's like a manual.

Like it 's a handbook. Like you have all the steps to do exactly what you 're supposed to.

So two times two , you have one way to do it , and the teacher says , this is the way you do it.

So , but life is not like that. Life is like , they 're a different , because each one has its own way to do it.

So what us , like me , can do is to show them up.

So here you have them up , but what you are going to do with them up , that 's your problem. That 's something you have to figure out. Basically imagine that I give you a map.

So I can share with you the map. This is what I 'm doing. And a picture that this map is a circle , and you have like many different ways. And there are mountains and lakes in the middle.

So I can show you the map and the waves and the different paths and the different mountains and lakes. And so on , but how you go to the other side is your vision. How you are going to walk. If you 're going to go faster or slower , if you want to climb the mountains and cross the other side or you want to take a car or you want to cross the lake by swimming the house , it 's all about you.

So what we are really doing here is showing the map. But the house , how , how it 's only how you , you have to discover it through your life.

So I do n't know if you are having dreams or nightmares , but I have been dreaming so much. I have never dreamed so much like this week. And I 'm writing everything all my dreams. And tonight 's dream was really heavy to see my poisons , my pinned.

And it was hard so that this is why I 'm also processing those things. That 's why I 'm quiet. Like that , trying to assimilate.

So that 's it.

So related to Dense , , today we have to talk about crisis. And basically it 's when our niece get broken and we just ca n't keep going.

So crisis means to divide. Crisis means to divide to separate things.

So it means a path that ends and the path that begins. Hmm.

So basically it 's a cut in the middle of our life.

So if we take our life like a path towards death , crisis would be this moment where you cut the path in in different pieces. And in each one you change your way or path or you just change the way in which you were walking that path.

So through our lives we live two different ways in which the crisis can come be. We can describe this crisis like transformation or change. But the difference between one and another is that transformation is to go from one shape into another. That 's the meaning of transform.

Trans means to go to another place like transit. Transit means to go from one place to another because sit means side. It turns it to go from one side to another. When we say transform means that you have a form , a shape and you change into another shape.

Okay.

So you transform yourself. And so the example for transformation would be like for example the how do you say the I do n't know the name for this. The the first thing that then it 's a butterfly. How do you say that?

What 's the easy? What 's on it? Ah , caterpillar.

So caterpillar is to to butterfly. Thank you. Would be that transformation.

Okay. That 's a transformation. But change would be , I do n't know , call weather and suddenly the caterpillar freeze and get stuck in that. It does n't have the process of transformation.

It just a warm.

Okay.

So that would be change. Change is like fast.

Something that you can not process.

So this is why we can not relate transformation with crisis. We can really change with crisis because crisis means to cut the path in health.

So this means that it 's something that it does n't have a process to get to. It 's something that it 's out of your possibilities that it was out from your planning. You had no idea about it. You have no time to prepare yourself for what is coming up.

So that would be the problem.

Okay. That would be the problem of change. There is n't we get into a crisis is because we had n't seen the signals for that change.

So the way we can understand why we arrive to a crisis is like having this picture. Imagine yourself. , Imagine yourself being driving a car.

Okay. And you drive the car and every one kilometer used to see a signal signs.

Sorry , sign. Let 's say there is a hole in the , in the road ahead.

So you see that repeating each kilometer and then you see it , each 500 meters and then you see it again every 100 meters and then there 's the hole in the ground.

So depending on how much attention you pay in the path , you will know when you have to lower your speed to change your direction.

So nothing wrong can happen. But if you just go fast and you do n't see any sign.

So suddenly you will get straight to the bottom and maybe have an accident.

So , , so basically , , that 's a crisis. Because you were paying attention to all the signs , the signals that you have been receiving.

So the image that we have to , to understand is that the whole universe , the whole life is basically a process of transformations. The moment we are born until the moment we die , life is transformation. Life is basically a transformation.

So , , when people are saying , I do n't want to change , I want to , to stay like , secure , comfortable with this situation and you do n't want to change. , so everything is dark and , but there 's a moment that , , life can not hold all that energy of transformation.

So it does everything in one spot. All the things that you were holding during your life happen all in the same moment because you were holding it.

Okay , so this is like , like , trying to throw an arrow with a bow and you pull the bow , pull the bow , but you never left the arrow go away.

So as much you pull , suddenly the bow will break and it will break your face so , , so this would be basically why we have a crisis.

So by acknowledging that from the base , life is transformation.

So everything that I am not transforming in my life , that is constantly the same.

So it will , it will become a crisis eventually. Basically the crisis that we are living in our lives , all the , all the crisis that you have lived in your life. They , they are , , basically the result of a process of transformation that , that , that was n't , , that you were in paying attention to.

Okay , so you have to think about your own crisis. You have to think about , what you are holding in , what you 're holding and you 're not willing to transform in your life. And that will become a crisis if you do n't do it. Basically that 's , that is how it works.

Life is to transform yourself.

Remember that this is niece related to the chara of the niece.

So , niece are the ones allowing us to be flexible in the path of life to walk ahead.

So this would mean that if we do n't , , that if we do n't allow ourselves to transform , they will break. Because when we have to move forward , if we are not able to move our knees , they will break.

So basically this is why our society humanity is like this right now. Because humans had n't been responsible through so long that all the karma is just coming now all together.

So the reason why we are living all this now is because we are really close to start a new path in our history. But we are not going to be able to start that path if we do n't go through the crisis we could be through ourselves. We still have like two years more of this karma that will be very heavy.

So two years more in which we have to be pero selves with all this karma within. We have to heal this crisis that we have within and help others to try to solve it as best as possible. And from that we can change transform. We can make crisis into transformation.

Crisis is a very , , is it an important part of our transformation. But our transformation is about to be organic and crisis makes it strong and you suffer by it.

So crisis is part of the system that helps but it 's not necessary. It 's just a choice. Let 's think for today what are the things that we do n't want to live in our lives? The things that we are attached to.

What are those things that we do n't want to change in our lives?

So before you go to sleep today , try to think about what is your biggest attachment that you do n't want to change your life.

So your subconscious can show you what is your next crisis.

## Daily Practice Elements

So information for today. The variation for today is new , like the animal. New. The statement for today is I am the expansion of time.

The code for today is the second dimension. Related with the concept of duality , this dimension protects two planes through which all unity is manifested , time and space. This dimension will show us that all existing things are aspects that move between these two factors that allow existence. They are lines , patterns and draw realities.

Another thing that I saw that he said yesterday is about you are the Venom , the poison of the world. And basically remember that Venom comes from the word love.

So it 's origin means love.

So basically Venom is love that has been given in a mistaken doses. Like you 're not given the love in the proper doses.

So it 's a stop ridocis. I do n't know if in English you say it like this.

So it 's toxic. When you have more than you are supposed to or less than you 're supposed to.

So it 's a really bad administration of your love that becomes Venom.

Okay , the same way in which a good thing in a different doses can become Venom in biology , something toxic.

So love also can be toxic. And that 's what he wanted to say. That an overdose of an overdose of love. It 's also toxic.

That is why he said you are the Venom of this world. Until you are not coherent responsible , you will be that Venom. Because you are a love.

So this is why when we hear this phrase , this sentence like , I am all love. It 's all love with me.

So maybe you are being toxic. You have to to be aware of that. We begin to move my shoulders and circles to relax the tension. I let all the weight fall down and by taking a deep breath , my foot goes only in my breathing.

I perceive all the light around me. Getting in to my body through the skin , feeling up , all my inner self. I feel the light shining out and inside myself. For I am delight.

## Energy Work

I am I am the higher self. My own higher self. Shining above my head and getting inside my body , bringing awareness. Take you to bed and go within your body through the crown through eye , throat , heart.

Alexis , scrum , root , mix , ankles. I desire to make all of my crisis. I conscious transformation. Take you deep breath and jump towards the core of the planet.

Through the crust , with roots , soil and rocks , feeling the heat of the magma. Going faster towards the pressure of the iron core of the earth. I 've come aware about all the crises that I have. I 've all those yet to come and die at knowledge that the pressure the day put on me.

I have been moving what I am. This in this way that I said my intention to go through my history through time to understand all this crisis as a way for me. But now from the space by the side and setting tension to made of them my own transformation. I am the expansion of time.

I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time.

I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time. I am the expansion of time.
