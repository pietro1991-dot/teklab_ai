## Introduction

Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

## Q&A

So let 's talk about the topic for today , related to niece , which is the law. What are our weird thing this topic of law? Because sometimes we need it , like we ask for it. And some other times we say , I do n't want , I do n't like it.

So it 's like if we are going ahead with one leg and the other behind. And we need to talk about the law. Of course , that law has nothing in common with that thing that we do n't like about the law.

So today we 're going to speak and re-signify what law is. Of course , that we can ask ourselves why in this week we are going to speak about the law. And that 's clear because the past seven days we have been speaking about the seven laws of the universe.

So what are they laws?

So this seven days , this past seven days , we have been speaking about the seven laws of the universe or the seven principles.

So let 's understand first the difference between principles and laws.

So first of all , principle comes from the Latin which is primes that means one. The first would be and then coupled that means a cap that 's catch to ground , okay.

So it would mean to take the first place. That is what it means principle.

So to take the first place means that everything that is principle begins is the origin of everything.

So that 's why the seven principles of the universe represents that they are the same origin that they are born in the same spot , the same place , the same moment.

So as we have been speaking these days , that laws of the universe , principles of the universe , we 're not one person , the other one later and then the other one and then the other one. No , they did n't appear one after the other one , all in the same moment at the same time.

So this is why they are called the principles , the seven principles of the universe because they are the beginning of the whole thing. But even if you are the beginning , if they are the beginning , it means that they are continues in the universe. But the seven principles starts to repeat and modify the life of everyone of us , ruling the life of everyone of everything that exists. That is why they become laws , okay.

This is why they are laws , the seven laws of the universe.

So what is a law? Law comes from the Latin word , leg. Leg means in European languages means to choose something.

So also creates the words like a legion , a legion comes from there to make an election of something , entirely intelligent. That lex is also there. College is also there , that word.

So it means to choose something , to choose a path , to choose something.

So this means that the law represents that there is something that different beings or different people choose as something real , like they choose something.

So they choose something and they create a law. A law is the incarnation of that that was chosen by many.

So let 's go to the story of how a law begins , how a law has been created.

So for that we have to go to the very origin of the humanity when we were still living in case.

So nanotols and homosapiens and we were just beginning as humans are now.

So in that moment , in that moment what happened is that we were living in tribes.

So the Latin name for groups of three.

So a minimum of three people is a tribe because it comes from that three that means three.

So this group of three or more people that the smallest one is three this tribe. They need to organize in their cave because basically they need to survive.

So in order to survive when they have to do is to organize themselves to make some tests.

So one of them will take care of the house , the other one will go and collect and the other one will go and hunt.

So this main organization is what they , in order to accomplish this organization they need to sit down and to discuss , okay , I am going to do this , you will do this , you will do that , okay , so each one has its own tests.

So they organize it , they discuss it , they have a consensus about that , that 's first law. That 's the first law.

So the first law is everyone will do this in order for us to survive , okay.

So when this law repeats itself for thousands of years that 's what we call a pattern something that we some moment we choose to do , but now we are not choosing it , we are not choosing it , but it keeps going because repeat the many times , okay.

So that 's how the pattern arrives to us , like for example the man going out to hunt , so going for the resources and the women stay in close to the home to take care of the cave for some.

So here comes the past of the times and suddenly the time it tries starts to be bigger with much more people so much more responsibilities.

So when the group starts to grow and there are many people , they need to start to live in harmony and the way they live in harmony is by being altogether in a common union. A common union is that we call is what we call today at community , community is towards common union , common is that everyone can share and be equals has the same opportunities and unity is that they all live in the same place together.

So what in order for this to work , they need to establish certain 's normal , certain 's rules , okay.

So this rules that they had to establish , they are according to the place where they live.

So they started to create these concepts and these ideas related to this environment and these people where you are living with. And in Latin we call that , modes , modes is the place where you live , modes.

So the concept that helps you to live in harmony , in community , in that is what we call morality. That 's the origin , so morality , the morals are the concepts , the rules that helps us to live in a common union.

So inside the morality , remember morality is about to have some certain rules to live together in a community , we have these two different other options , which are natural. Within the morality we know we can distinguish what is good and what is wrong. But not about a subjective point of view , but from an objective point of view. And this means , for example , in a group , in a group that we are all together as a community , when someone kills someone , everyone knows that this is with a common unity.

So that 's something that is wrong , is objective. There is no sometimes that killing is fine or no , it 's just like that , we know that this is wrong. And the other side when you plant and when you saw a plant and then it grows and you share the food and so on , that we say is fine.

So we know because everyone is in need of eating , so it 's something we need.

So kind of we understand that way what is good and what is wrong by nature , not by ideas , just by nature , understand what is good and what is wrong. That in Latin we call it use , use is what then we will call use this justice and English.

So from there comes the concept of justice , okay , is the balance between the things in one place , okay , according to the life of one specific spot. You find this balance of the objective things , not the objectives.

So justice is related to morality because justice is different in every region because for every culture , for every culture , the justice will be related to the morality of that place. And remember morality is about to inhabit one spot , okay , is then more aid is the place where you leave according to the place where you leave.

So then after this , the community starts to grow and grow and expand and suddenly they create a civilization.

So the civilization starts to expand , not in just one small village , but now it 's many villages all connected by commerce and so on , but each one of them has a different morality because they live in different spots , but they 're all connected anyway. And all these people spread around the territories. Suddenly they get to the point of chaos because now they have different modalities , but they have no idea how to connect to each other.

So this is like a mess.

So here comes one day that they have to get all together and discuss about how can we live in harmony all together with different modalities. And this is how they create this assembly , you say , to talk to discuss , to choose to elect the new normative and these normative are the ones that will go through the subjectivity , not the objectivity of the reality. But they will be subjective from another point of view surrounding the whole community , all of the communities together under these norms , these normative and that 's what we call a law.

So first thing , morality is something related to one place , one culture and related specifically to one community. The justice is the terms , the natural terms objective term that we understand , that we understand what is wrong and what is fine. And the third one is the law , which is the subjective , the subjective aspect that helps us to live harmony , even if we do n't , if we do n't share the same justice or the same morality , we can kind of live in harmony between different communities in different regions.

So now let 's go against the origin of the universe to the main principles of the universe again where everything began. In the origin , we have the mind , there 's only mind and this mind also will divide itself in a tribe , this tribe is a Trinity that we call consciousness and consciousness and subconsciousness. This is the main Trinity.

So this Trinity are like different people that we 'll have to choose different rules in order to be connected through the universe. And they , three , choose the seven laws of the universe.

So the principles of the universe create seven laws through which the three aspects of the mind will be able to interact through the creation.

So they do n't get in mess , they are organized.

So this is the same thing in which we can understand how the universe has created the seven laws according to how we humans created the laws.

So now we will we will see this that the loss of the universe are not something that are obligation us to do things. These three laws , these laws , the seven laws , where decided elected by my three consciousness , conscious unconscious and subconscious.

So by three will they choose these laws because they were connected altogether. Yes? If they are not connected , if they are not in coherence , if they missed the coherence , we are controlled by the seven laws. But if we get coherence and we coherent and we get connected in the three as one.

So we reach the free will again and we become the judges. This three consciousness. This is why we are working so much with this three. But the consciousness and the subconsciousness and the subconsciousness.

Because if they are separated , they are being controlled by the seven laws of the universe. But if they get into the harmony , balance , you are the one being able to rewrite the seven laws by three will.

So the laws are not in the control of us. The laws are things that guide us during the process of being lost. What do I mean with rewriting the laws? The laws are the base of everything.

So it is not about eliminating the laws. It is about to use the laws. For example , if I am vibrating very low , I will be conditioned by the laws of the universe to violate like this. If I am vibrating this , if I rebound in that vibration.

Okay?

So I rebound there.

So I am still there. But if I become coherent , what I do is to choose the way in which I will violate.

So I can violate higher and transform my reality. I can choose which vibration I will be in.

So when the laws of the universe are you see me , that 's what we call atoms. When I use the law , it 's what we call an election , it 's free will. To rewrite the law , it 's not to eliminate a law I 'm right and you want. It 's to be able to use the law and not allow the law to use me.

And the only way in which I can become aware of this is by becoming conscious. And how can I be conscious by uniting the three consciousness in me?

So remember , we have spoken about this in others. But remember , the conscious is the one that knows where it goes. The unconscious is the energy from the environment that pushed me to do something. And the subconscious is all the things that create me from inside that makes me be , by eye.

And I can not control. Well , we , what we call patterns in our life. They are not patterns , they are locked. And what this means that we have chosen them.

We have done the election through thousands of years through our genealogical tree. Our ancestors , everyone in every nation that we had , every life , everything that we have done. Everything was an election , everything 's a choice.

So we have chosen everything. And suddenly , when we have chosen , became something that we felt it was light and protected us. And that 's why it became a pattern. And we repeated once and again.

So it 's not about a limit patterns. Or we have to do is to go to the subconscious to understand why we choose them. And then we take it to the unconscious to know where we use them , why we are still using them. And we take that tool as a law , and I use it in my consciousness.

So this is why all of us have been working through all this years with so many therapies. Trying to go within , trying to go to the subconscious to look for the patterns why we have chosen these patterns.

So that 's why every therapy that you do a casual records by a decodification , astrological charts , anything that you do.

So try to understand what 's happening within you , when you have chosen this , is because you have to see where you have done the choice. And there 's when you understand that you are the constitution of all those choices that you called laws , all the laws. The now we understand as patterns , all this law , we 're put together in the place here and now , which in Latin we call constitution constitution constitution is this , when everything put together here and now. The same way as an individual.

That creates essentially.

So it 's the same thing.

So here comes this idea that in the same way as an individual has to go past to understand in the subconscious all information that we receive from the elections , the laws that we created in the past.

So the patterns that we have and now I understand from the subconscious and then conscience why am I using this so I say I have to change this to transform myself. By the consciousness. This is changing the pattern to set myself free to change to evolve the same thing happened with the countries.

So I have to change my own constitution by changing the laws , the patterns that I have created. This means that the laws were not done to be something fixed. The laws were done to accompany a community , a community , a community , a community , a community , a community , a community of people that needed a way to survive.

So in this way is how we have created the laws.

So if the individual changed and needs for that change to come must transform the laws must transform the constitution of itself. The same thing happened in the countries. We can not have countries with constitutions that were written for a community in the 19th century. We have to recreate a constitution for our communities today changing the laws according to our communities today.

Is the same way in which we are healing ourselves how we heal the countries. The laws are not there to be accomplished. The laws are there to help us to go through a process in a specific time , a specific moment. Because it means that we have made a choice.

So the wrong thing with this world is that we lost our inner power. And what is power? Power is responsibility. And now we go to try to understand what is responsibility.

So what is responsibility comes from the word , responsibility , responsibility.

So this means to have the ability to respond again. That 's the meaning of the word.

So what this means that the responsibility is to have the ability to answer to the meaning of the word.

So what the world is given to us. The word gives something to us and we give that back again. We respond. We answer to the world with what with our inner strength with our inner power , the will.

So when we activate the responsibility , we are taking our power out. But if we are not responsible , we will step forward.

So what happened? When a person does n't have the ability to respond , starts to be a friend because does n't know how to respond to the word.

So it gives a pay its own power to others to take care.

So when I give the power to others , that means that this other person will have now the responsibility.

So that other person will have the option to choose over me.

So because I have no idea how to do it , how to manage my life , I choose that person to choose for me , the new laws. This is the way in which the systems of imperialism , modern key , feudalism , dictatorship appear. In between the 15 and the 6th centuries , the free thinkers , they brought again from long time ago the ideas of republics and democracy. And they put that philosophy again in our time , but ruled by the feudalism.

This is why in the last centuries , people were talking about republics and democracy , even if it was never republics and democracy. The only thing that we have had during all this time was a liberal feudalism.

So through all this thousands of years , not only this 200 years , thousands of years , we have given the power to them to choose over us , so they elected and they created the laws for us. And this is the thing that had created in the unconscious of the people , the idea that the systems and laws are wrong.

So laws and systems are not bad things , but they are being used through our lack of responsibility. And responsibility is about evolution , not revolution. The evolution move forward , the revolution removes. This is why a revolution never really got to change the systems.

The problem here is because in revolutions , we usually blame others for the things that happen. But nobody is guilty for what happened. We are the only responsible of what is going to happen.

So remember , it 's not the laws that controls us. They are not the ones that control and are not allowing us to move forward. It 's our responsibility that made laws into patterns. And do n't worry because we are going to talk a lot about this because in the next weeks to come , we will speak about each one of the systems.

So relax because in the next weeks for sure , we 'll come out all the the right wing of politics , the left wing of politics. The pro , the against the many things , so I will get a lot of fun.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go now to the alignment. The vibration day is the statement for today is I am the branches of the genealogy tree. The code for today is enlightenment. The highest comprehension of the divinity or the inner awareness of it is the enlightenment.

It is a concept searched by thousands of people that from the biological concept see it as a final detective go in the path of evolution. However , it is an inner and state to who lives the physical life to the fullest knowing that everything is divine and that oneself is knowing that everything is connected. Enlightening is not searching for the light is remembering that I always was. I think they were so many concepts today , but I guess they were needed to be spoken altogether.

See it comfortable. Close your eyes and focus on the breathing. Take a deep breath. Be aware of the place you find yourself now.

Use your imagination to decide a big library around you. Follow with books , galleries , halls. I recognize that this library is within my subconscious and each book is a registry is a pattern that relies within me. This is bone and calcium records and I am the only librarian.

I can find any information here just by sentient intention of this film or by feeling it thinking of the topic. I remember that I am here with an intention to find the pattern , the book , where I can find the information of that law. The information of that law that controls my whole life and that I made into a pattern. I go through everyone 's first galleries until I find a book and take in between my hands without touchments.

I am here with this book in my hands. I head to the main hall where this time I find there a huge tree. This tree represents each one of my ancestors. Everyone , I have been.

Everyone lives within me and through me. I give closer to the tree and I take one of its fruits. This fruit represents the whole history of everything that my ancestors have done.

So it is my decision to get it for Egypt. Behind the tree I can see the stairs of my unconscious and the both the office of the conscious. I go through the stairs with the fruits and the both willing to bring clarity to this pattern to this law. I go through the stairs with the fruits and the rest of my life.

I find myself surrounded by the light of consciousness and inside. I open the book , contemplating this law. I go through the stairs with the fruits and the rest of my life. I go through the stairs with the fruits and the rest of my life.

I go through the stairs with the fruits and the rest of my life. I go through the stairs with the fruits and the rest of my life. I go through the stairs with the fruits and the rest of my life. Take a deep breath and see if you bring this fruit to your knees.

Begin to sound with creation today. I go through the stairs with the fruits and the rest of my life. I recognize that this law that became a pattern now through my consciousness can be used by me in my new life. This is a tool that I use.

I observe behind me the tree and I recognize that in the fruit within me , I find the information of all my technological tree. For I am the constitution of each one of the laws in its branches. I am the branches of my genealogy tree. I am the branches of my genealogy tree.

I am the constitution of all the laws. Take a deep breath and bring this consciousness by crossing stretching your body and your knee. In each one of its own time , open your eyes. Take care everybody for being there as always.
