## Overview

On January 8th, Matias explores the nature of **Law**—not just as rules that control us, but as principles we choose to organize our lives. After spending seven days learning the seven Hermetic laws, today we understand what "law" actually means and how it relates to our personal and collective evolution.

The teaching reveals that **laws are not meant to control us—they're meant to help us when we're lost.** When the three aspects of our consciousness (conscious, unconscious, subconscious) become coherent and connected, we gain free will. **We can then rewrite the laws by our own choice.**

Matias also clarifies the difference between **principles** (the origin), **morality** (cultural rules for living in community), **justice** (objective understanding of right and wrong), and **law** (subjective agreements between different communities). Understanding these distinctions helps us see that **patterns are not prisons—they are choices we made that we can now transform.**

## Core Teaching

### The Difference Between Principles and Laws

For the past seven days, we've been learning about the **seven laws of the universe**—also called the **seven principles.**

**What's the difference?**

**Principle** comes from Latin: **"primus"** (first) + **"capere"** (to catch, to take hold).

**Principle = to take the first place.** It means **the origin of everything.**

The seven principles of the universe are called "principles" because **they all appear at the same time, in the same moment.** They are the beginning—the origin.

**They didn't appear one after another.** They emerged together, all at once, as aspects of the one mind.

### Principles Become Laws When They Repeat

Even though the principles are the beginning, **they continue throughout the universe.**

The seven principles **repeat and modify the life of everything that exists.** They rule everything.

**When principles repeat and rule, they become laws.**

**Law** comes from Latin: **"lex,"** which means **to choose something.**

Related words:
- **Legion** (to make an election, a selection)
- **Intelligent** (from "lex"—to choose wisely)
- **College** (a place where people choose knowledge)

**A law is something that different beings or people choose as real.** They choose a path, they choose something together.

**A law is the incarnation of what was chosen by many.**

### How Laws Began: From Tribes to Civilizations

Let's go back to the origin of humanity—when we lived in caves as Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens.

We lived in **tribes.** The word "tribe" comes from the Latin word for "three"—because **the smallest group is three people.**

To survive, tribes needed to organize. They made tasks:
- One person takes care of the home.
- One person collects food.
- One person hunts.

To accomplish this, they sat down, discussed, and came to a **consensus.**

**This is the first law:** "We will do this in order to survive."

When this law repeated for thousands of years, it became a **pattern**—something we no longer consciously choose, but keep doing because it's been repeated so many times.

### From Tribes to Communities: The Birth of Morality

As tribes grew into larger groups with more people, they needed to live in harmony.

To live in harmony, they needed a **common union**—what we call **community.**

**Community = common (everyone equal) + union (living together).**

To make this work, they established **rules** and **norms** according to the place they lived and the people they lived with.

**These rules are called MORALITY.**

**Morality** comes from Latin: **"mos"** (the place where you live).

**Morality = the concepts and rules that help us live in common union in a specific place.**

Morality is **local**—it depends on the culture, the environment, the community.

### Justice: The Objective Balance

Within morality, we can distinguish between **what is good and what is wrong**—not subjectively, but **objectively.**

For example:
- **Killing someone breaks the community.** Everyone knows this is wrong. It's objective.
- **Planting food and sharing it helps the community.** Everyone knows this is good. It's objective.

This objective understanding of balance is called **justice.**

**Justice** comes from Latin: **"ius"** (balance, fairness).

**Justice = the balance between things in one place, according to the life of that specific spot.**

Justice is related to morality because **justice is different in every region.** Each culture has different morality, so each culture has different justice.

### Law: Subjective Agreements Across Communities

As communities expanded and connected through commerce, they encountered a problem:

**Each village had different morality** (because they lived in different places), **but they needed to connect and trade.**

Different moralities = chaos.

So they gathered in an **assembly** to discuss: **"How can we live in harmony with different moralities?"**

They created a new set of norms—**laws.**

**Laws are subjective agreements that help different communities live in harmony, even if they don't share the same justice or morality.**

**Law = the subjective aspect that connects multiple communities together under agreed norms.**

### Summary: Morality, Justice, and Law

- **Morality:** Related to one place, one culture, one community. Local rules.
- **Justice:** The natural, objective understanding of right and wrong. Universal within a culture.
- **Law:** The subjective agreements that allow different communities with different moralities to coexist.

### The Seven Laws of the Universe: Chosen by the Three Minds

Now, let's return to the universe.

In the origin, there is **Mind.** This Mind divides into a **Trinity:**
1. **Consciousness** (what you know)
2. **Unconsciousness** (what the environment pushes you to do)
3. **Subconsciousness** (what's inside you that you can't control—patterns, ancestry)

**These three aspects chose the seven laws of the universe** to interact through creation in an organized way.

**The seven laws were not imposed on us.** They were **chosen** by the three aspects of the mind—by **free will.**

### Laws Control Us When We Lose Coherence

**If the three aspects of consciousness are connected and coherent, we have free will.** We can choose. We can rewrite the laws.

**But if the three aspects are separated and disconnected, we are controlled by the seven laws.**

**When we lose coherence, the laws use us. When we gain coherence, we use the laws.**

### Rewriting the Laws Through Consciousness

**To rewrite the laws doesn't mean to eliminate them.** It means **to use them consciously** instead of being used by them.

For example:

**If I vibrate low, I am conditioned by the law of vibration to stay low.** I'm stuck.

**But if I become coherent (unite the three consciousness), I can choose the vibration I want.** I can vibrate higher. I transform my reality.

**This is free will.** This is using the law, not being controlled by it.

### Patterns Are Laws We Chose

In our lives, **patterns are not accidents.** They are **choices we made**—through thousands of years, through our genealogical tree, through every life, every nation.

**We chose everything.** And when we chose, it felt safe and protective. So it became a pattern—something we repeat automatically.

**Patterns are not prisons.** They are **laws we created for ourselves.**

To transform, we must:
1. **Go to the subconscious** to understand **why we chose the pattern** (what need it fulfilled).
2. **Take it to the unconscious** to see **why we're still using it.**
3. **Bring it to the conscious** to **use it as a tool** instead of being controlled by it.

### Countries Must Also Transform Their Laws

**The same applies to countries.**

An individual has a **constitution**—all the laws and patterns put together here and now.

A country also has a **constitution**—the laws created by its people.

**If an individual changes and evolves, they must transform their laws (patterns) to match their new consciousness.**

**If a country changes and evolves, it must transform its constitution (laws) to match its new community.**

**Laws are not meant to be fixed forever.** They were created to help a specific community in a specific time.

**When the community changes, the laws must change.**

### Responsibility: The Ability to Respond

**Power = responsibility.**

**Responsibility** comes from: **"re"** (again) + **"spondere"** (to respond).

**Responsibility = the ability to respond again.**

The world gives something to us, and we respond with our inner strength, our will.

**When we activate responsibility, we take our power.**

**When we don't have the ability to respond, we become afraid.** We give our power to others. We let them choose for us.

**This is how dictatorships, monarchies, and feudalism appear:** people give away their power because they don't know how to respond.

### Evolution vs. Revolution

**Responsibility is about evolution, not revolution.**

**Evolution = moving forward.** Progress. Growth.

**Revolution = removing, revolving.** Going in circles. Blaming others.

**Revolutions never truly change systems** because they focus on blame.

**But nobody is guilty for what happened. We are responsible for what will happen.**

### Enlightenment: Remembering You Always Were Light

The code for today is **Enlightenment.**

**Enlightenment is not about searching for the light.** It's about **remembering that you always were the light.**

It's the highest comprehension of divinity—the inner awareness that **everything is divine, and you are divine.**

**Enlightenment is not a final objective.** It's an inner state where you live physical life to the fullest, **knowing everything is connected.**

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit comfortably and close your eyes.
2. Focus on your breathing.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Imagine a huge library around you—your Akashic Records, your subconscious.

2. Each book is a pattern, a registry within you.

3. Ask: **"What is the law, the pattern, that controls my life? What have I made into a pattern that no longer serves me?"**

4. Walk through the galleries until you find the book. Take it in your hands without judgment.

5. You are here with this book. Go to the main hall, where you see a **huge tree.**

6. This tree represents each of your ancestors. Everyone you have been. Everyone lives within you and through you.

7. Take one of the tree's fruits. This fruit represents the whole history of everything your ancestors have done.

8. Behind the tree, you see the stairs of your unconscious, leading to the office of your conscious (filled with light).

9. Go through the stairs with the fruit and the book, willing to bring clarity to this pattern, this law.

10. As you climb, repeat: **"I Am the Branches of My Genealogic Tree."**

11. **"I Am the Branches of My Genealogic Tree."**

12. **"I Am the Branches of My Genealogic Tree."**

13. Reach the office of light. You are surrounded by consciousness and clarity.

14. Open the book. See the law, the pattern.

15. Take a deep breath. Bring the fruit to your knees. Begin to sound the vibration: **"LLu."**

16. Recognize: **this law that became a pattern can now be used by me consciously. It's a tool, not a prison.**

17. Look behind you at the tree. The fruit within you holds the information of your entire genealogical tree.

18. **You are the constitution of each one of the laws in its branches.**

19. Take a deep breath. Stretch your body. Return here and now.

### Closing

1. Open your eyes.
2. Write down what you discovered about the pattern/law that controls you.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Identify one pattern in your life that feels like a law controlling you. Ask: "Why did I choose this pattern? What need did it fulfill?" Then, bring it to consciousness: "How can I use this pattern as a tool instead of being controlled by it?" Write down your insights.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel controlled by circumstances, remember: **the laws (patterns) were chosen by you, through your ancestry, through your experiences.** You are not a victim. You are the constitution of those choices. And you have the power to rewrite them—not by eliminating them, but by using them consciously. This is responsibility. This is evolution.

## Q&A

### Q: What is the difference between principles and laws?

Principles are the origin—they all appear at the same time as aspects of the one Mind. Laws are principles that repeat and rule life. Principles = the beginning. Laws = the continuation and application of principles.

### Q: What is morality?

Morality comes from "mos" (place). It's the set of rules and concepts that help people live in common union in a specific place. Morality is local—it depends on culture, environment, and community. Different places have different moralities.

### Q: What is justice?

Justice is the objective understanding of right and wrong within a specific culture. It's the balance that everyone naturally recognizes—killing breaks community (wrong), sharing food helps community (right). Justice is related to morality but focuses on objective balance.

### Q: How are laws different from morality and justice?

Laws are subjective agreements created when different communities (with different moralities) need to coexist. Laws allow multiple cultures to live in harmony even if they don't share the same morality or justice. Laws connect diversity.

### Q: How were the seven universal laws created?

The Mind divided into three aspects: conscious, unconscious, subconscious. These three chose the seven laws to organize their interaction through creation. The laws were elected by free will, not imposed.

### Q: Why do the laws control some people and not others?

When the three aspects of consciousness are separated and incoherent, the laws control us. When the three aspects unite and become coherent, we gain free will and can use the laws consciously. Coherence = freedom. Separation = control.

### Q: What does it mean to "rewrite the laws"?

It doesn't mean eliminating the laws—it means using them consciously instead of being used by them. For example, instead of being stuck in low vibration, you become coherent and choose a higher vibration. You're not escaping the law of vibration; you're using it.

### Q: How do I transform patterns that control me?

Go to the subconscious to understand why you chose the pattern (what need it met). Take it to the unconscious to see why you're still using it. Bring it to the conscious to use it as a tool. Patterns are not prisons—they're choices you can now transform.
