## Overview

Today we continue in the Physical Week of Pisces, working with the Third Eye Chakra. Our topic is the look—to look, to gaze, to observe. This goes deeper than mere sight. It's about the soul expressing and receiving through the eyes.

The look is light. The eyes are the windows of the soul.

---

## The Etymology of Look

### Look Means Light

The word "look" represents something that is bright, something that is shining. This word comes from the Indo-European language "leuk," which means light, bright, shining. That's why it has the same origin as the word "light."

Light and look have the same origin. To look is to put light on something. To look is to make something bright, to make something shine.

### Mirror and Mirar

In Spanish, the word for look is "mirar." Mirar is originated in the word "smyrian" in Indo-European language, which is also the origin for the word "smile." Smyrian means smile, and smile comes from this same root.

Mirar is like a kind of reflection of something that you are watching, that you are seeing. To see is only yourself staring at something—watching something is unidirectional. But to mirar, it's a reflection.

To look is to receive the light of something. The word that in Spanish you say "mirar" is the origin of the word in English "mirror."

Mirror is to look at, and it represents the smile that you can see from yourself in others.

This is why the word "to look" is much more related to the soul than the physical aspect of sight.

## Sight vs Look

### Sight: One of the Five Senses

Sight, remember, is one of the five senses. As a sense, it is the tool that we use to receive the pulses from the outside to interpret them within our neurological system, in our brain, so we could interpret an environment we are moving in.

### Look: Related to the Soul

To gaze, to observe, to look goes a little bit deeper. It's much more related to the soul than with the perception of things, the observation of things.

By looking at something, we can look with closed inner eyes, the "I" and the reality outside, or we can open our eyes to feel that reality outside, to be aware of it.

## The Evolution of the Eyes

### The Best Extension of the Brain

Through thousands of years of evolution, the eyes have become one of the best designs in our body. Why is that? Because the eyes are basically the best extension of our brain.

The eyes are the only organs that can not only perceive the realities that are outside, but also show to the outside the reality that you have within—the reality that you have in your brain, the real you.

The eyes have been one of the best evolved organs of our body because we have been evolving through thousands of years trying to survive in our environment.

### Designed for Survival

Our brain is trying to help us survive—something we already said many times. The brain is trying to see where are the dangers outside, so it tries to protect itself all the time.

Because of this protection that the body is looking for, the eyes have been designed to detect all the dangers around. They see everywhere what could happen and what can kill me.

---

## Detecting Eyes: The Pareidolia Effect

### Looking for Enemies

One of the most important things we have is to detect the eyes of enemies, to detect who is going to attack us because of the eyes.

Remember that we spoke once about the pareidolia effect in our brain—the brain is looking for familiar images everywhere in nature and all things. One of the main things the brain is trying to look for are things with eyes, with a face. But mainly eyes.

The brain is trying to detect everywhere the eyes of something. Why? Because the eyes are pointing towards a direction, and to where those eyes point, the rest of the body goes.

### Escaping Hunters

This means that what we are trying to do in our nature is trying to escape from the hunters, from the beings that can kill us and eat us. That's why our eyes are designed to look into the enemy's eyes.

That's why the brain is trying to look by pareidolia at all these eyes in nature, so it can see if they are staring and looking at us to attack us.

---

## Why We Don't Look Straight into Eyes

### A Tool of Defense

This makes the sight developed like a tool of defense. The eyes are trying to defend ourselves from the weakness that we have within.

This story of the evolution of the eye trying to defend us from the weakness within is the reason why more than 90% of humans usually don't look straight into the eyes when they speak to someone.

### This Is Biological, Not Psychological

And this is not psychological. This is biological. Our eyes need to rest for a while. Every time we speak, for a fraction of time, our eyes look into another part of the face when we speak with someone.

They go to the nose, they go to the lips, to the ears. They go everywhere and they go back to the eyes and then go back to the nose and so on.

Why? Because the eyes give so much information constantly, all the time, that the body—your brain—needs to interpret so much data when it's straight to the eyes that it needs to rest.

### Wasting Energy

It wastes so much energy trying to understand what the sight, what the look is trying to say, that you lose energy in your physical, in your emotional, and your mental trying to solve that look.

The reason why the sight, the look, is so deep and takes so much energy is because the eyes have been designed as the most perfect extension of the brain.

---

## Eyes Communicate Both Ways

### Receiving and Sending Data

The eyes are not only processing information from the outside into the brain, but also the brain is communicating that information, that data, outside straight away. It's really easy to communicate with your eyes, not into words.

This is the origin of telepathy. Telepathy is basically this communication with your eyes with another person, because it's basically the neurons reflecting in the neurons of the other, sending signals through the sight, through looking at.

### Showing Weakness

Now, when you receive data, it's okay because you are storing data, experiences to move in environment. But when you share that information, when the brain is sending the signals out, it kind of loses the ability to defend because it's showing its weakness.

It's showing the truth that is inside. That's why people are scared of staring out—because the eyes are the ones that are showing all the things that you have within. You can be weak for the world in that moment. You feel out of all defenses.

---

## Eyes as Windows of the Soul

### Expressing Everything

This is why we call the eyes like the windows of the soul. Because the soul is basically all these networks of database going through the nervous system. They are the neurons of the soul.

Through the eyes I can show, express everything that I feel. Remember that from the point of view of survival, to show what I feel makes me weak.

### People Who Can Stare

There is some reason why some people can stare at the eyes and watch straight into the eyes. It's because those people don't have any problem with sharing exactly what happens within themselves. And because these people are not in the need of survival, they don't care about showing what they have within.

So they can look straight into the eyes and waste all the energy in that sight because they don't need to earn energy and save energy for survival.

### The Crazy Ones

This is why also we can relate this action of staring straight into the eyes and not moving inside with the crazy ones, because the crazy ones don't have the fear of losing control—they don't care. So they just stare, not being afraid of losing the power. Nothing to lose.

---

## The Evolutionary Design for Reproduction

### Eyes Like Peacock Feathers

Some people might say, "No, I look straight into the eyes when we speak," but most of you for sure don't realize that for tiny fractions of seconds you just change your point of view into another point of the face, so your eyes can rest for a tiny moment, for a fraction of time, resting the energy of watching into the eyes.

The reason this happens is because the eyes share straight so much information from the brain that the other brain that is watching, staring, cannot process all that information. Usually when a person is not looking straight into the eyes when they speak to someone, it's because the body is trying to protect themselves because you don't want the other one to know your weakness, your vulnerability. You don't want to be attacked.

Another way in which evolution took the looking, staring at someone, is through reproduction. In the same way as the birds, for example, have the feathers with different colors, some animals prepare themselves to be much more shiny and very easy to be seen by the other sex, the other gender.

We humans have the sight. We humans have the iris of the eyes. The way in which we look, the way in which we stare at someone, is something that thousands of years have been working in humans in the same way as for birds work the feathers.

Like the peacock has these beautiful eyes in the tail with all his feathers, we humans have our two eyes.

### Detecting Intention

That's why in the time of reproduction, staring into the eyes can tell us also about the intention of reproduction with a person. That's why it's popular that the iris contracts or expands according to showing us if we are open to receive that person or we are closed to that person.

All these things show us that the look we take to others, onto others, is a direct communication with our brain.

## The Look as Mirror

### Telepathy: Suffering at a Distance

The staring at, looking at someone straight into the eyes, is something that helps us to be much more connected in the network with others, to share information with others as being one.

Remember that the concept of "to look" is related to the idea of the mirror, the light on a mirror. This means that everything that my eyes are looking at is just a reflection of myself.

When I look straight into the eyes of someone, that someone will show me exactly what I have within. That's what is activated by looking: telepathy.

Telepathy, remember: "pathos" means pain and suffering. We have seen that pain and suffering. "Tele" means distance, means beyond, farther. So telepathy is related to suffering at a distance.

To suffer at a distance means that when you stare into the eyes of someone, your neurons create synapses with the mind of the other one. So from far away you can feel what the other one is feeling as if you were one.

### Seeing Yourself

What you see in the eyes of the other one is what you have within—is that reflection also of yourself. Otherwise you wouldn't see it.

This is why everything basically is a communication with yourself.

---

## Practicing the Look

### Opening to Communication

To practice the staring at, the looking at the eyes of someone, helps us to be much more open to tell where we feel, to share what we have within, and helps us to be much more telepathic. Helps us to have a better communication between ourselves.

We communicate better with our own self and with the others as if we are one.

We can practice that just looking at the mirror to ourselves, or by staring to someone that we love, or just staring at someone that we don't know. And we can start to practice the communication in silence. That's how we create synapses through telepathy.

### Why We Don't Have Telepathy

One of the things that we need, why we need to practice this, is because usually we are afraid to share what we have within. To stare at someone and to practice by staring to yourself helps for a better communication and telepathy.

Some people once asked me, "Why in this planet we don't have telepathy? Why we cannot communicate with other people like in other planets they do?"

Well, the reason is because in order to have telepathy, you shouldn't have fear to set and to show who you really are. And usually we are afraid to share who you are because we are scared about the judgment of others when they see what we have within.

## The Judgment of What We Share

### Example: The Picture

Usually people judge what we share. Just as an example of how it is the judgment of what we see, what we stare at:

The other day I put a picture that I liked—the composition of the picture was beautiful. But it was just the frame of what it was really happening. There were some people, but around were a lot of people. I had to be up so they can hear me better. There were everyone—there were cameras, police, tourists—it was terrible, normal context, and I was explaining something.

I saw the rays of lights and so on, so this picture was taken by Tia, and I loved the picture. I loved the composition of the picture.

Suddenly when I put the picture, the judgment came by the image saying, "You look like Jesus," or "Your ego is showing up, believing that you're Jesus," you know, like kind of this—everyone started to talk about that.

And I was like, "If I would really worry about these things, I don't do, I don't do that." But imagine people that received kind of these comments—they suddenly stopped sharing because they are scared of telling their truth, of sharing what they want, because of the judgments of others.

### Example: Sharing Emotions

Imagine now sharing an emotion—how would that be?

In another concept, for example, talking about emotions, something that happened to me also: When I write the post, I usually share everything that happens to me. Like, I don't care. I share every emotion, I share many of the things that I have.

I do that because I would love to encourage people to do the same. And I really thank all these people that write in the post and blogs to write in the post what they feel, what they share, what they have experienced. I really think that because that's the point.

But there are some other comments that they want to teach or to give advice, like "You should do this or do that," blah, blah, blah. And those comments are mainly through the judgment of my process. And I was just sharing my process—I was not asking for help.

### The Need for a Strong Ego

Imagine: I am a Leo, so I don't really care what people say. I have enough ego to survive. But imagine the people that are not able to have the ego to stand, and they can crack and fall apart because of the judgments or these kinds of things.

When you ask yourself, "Why in this planet we don't have telepathy?" It's basically because we are still judging each other all the time.

---

## How to Help Without Judging

### Respecting Privacy

The only way in which we can help really another person is when another person was open to receive help. The only reason why we can judge another person is because that person was open to be judged.

This is why it's very important to always do the questions to yourself in the first person. We can share visions, but we have to learn to identify when a vision can become a judgment towards the outside.

Because it's exactly this judgment, by the violation of the private space, that makes people to close. It makes people not be able to look into the eyes of the others, not to be able to communicate by the look, by gazing.

Let's communicate as one.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. Take a deep breath and softly start to caress and massage each part of your body from your feet until your head.

Become aware of each part of it. Become aware of your feet, your legs, genitals, hips, belly, chest, the back, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, face, and head.

### Massaging the Face

Softly start to massage from your ears, all the jaw, and then to the lips, the teeth, and going down to the neck. Softly trace the lips, the jaw, and the neck.

### Recognizing Your Face

Take a deep breath and, with your fingers, recognize your face. The eyes. My ears. Massage in circles only ears, the eyes, the cheeks, the eyebrows, the forehead. Massage with your hair towards the ears.

### Observing Your Eyes

In front of you, observe your own eyes watching you. Observe your eyes straight until you can perceive behind the consciousness that lies within.

Observe your eyes. Recognize that the eyes in you represent the dreamer, the day, the light. And the eyes in front of you represent the dream, the projection, the shadow, the night.

### Connecting to the Pineal

Pay attention to the pupil, the cornea, the entire eye, the nerves that connect both eyes to the center of your brain, where you can find this beautiful pearl—the pineal gland—shining with the light you perceive from the outside, radiating from within.

Take a deep breath and expand this gland. Recognize the manifestation of your consciousness that you achieve by the depths of your look.

### Sound the Vibration

Observe your eyes. I rebound. Be ready to be consciousness. Observe your eyes. I rebound. Be ready to be consciousness.

Tae. I am the manifested conscience. I am the manifested conscience. I rebound.

Be ready to be consciousness.

### Integration

Bring this consciousness all through your body by caressing stronger and stronger, coming back here and now, each one at your own time.

## Integration

### Mirror Practice

Today, practice looking into your own eyes in a mirror. Don't look away. Stare straight into your own eyes for several minutes. What do you see? What do you feel? This is you seeing yourself without hiding.

### Eye Contact Practice

When speaking with someone today, notice when you look away from their eyes. Notice the urge to protect yourself, to hide. Can you stay a moment longer? Can you show yourself a little more?

### Stop Judging

When you see someone's vulnerability today, resist the urge to give advice, to judge, to "help" when not asked. Simply witness. Simply see. Let them be.

## Q&A

### Q: Why do I feel uncomfortable looking into someone's eyes?

Because your biology is protecting you. For thousands of years, showing what's inside made you vulnerable to attack. Your brain is saying, "Don't show your weakness." But now, in safety, you can practice opening.

### Q: Is it rude to not look someone in the eyes?

In some cultures yes, in others no. But understand: even when we think we're looking straight into eyes, we're actually darting away for fractions of seconds to rest. This is natural and biological.

### Q: How can I develop telepathy?

By practicing the look without fear. Stare into your own eyes. Stare into the eyes of someone you trust. Share what's within without words. Let yourself be seen. This creates the neural pathways for telepathic communication.

### Q: What did you mean by "the eyes are the windows of the soul"?

The soul is the network of data through the nervous system. The eyes are the only organ that both receives this data and broadcasts it outward. Through the eyes, your entire inner world can be seen.

### Q: Why do "crazy people" stare?

Because they have no fear of losing control, no fear of showing what's within. They have nothing to protect, nothing to hide. So they stare freely, wasting all their energy without concern for survival.

### Q: If what I see in others is a reflection of myself, does that mean I am everything I see?

Yes. You contain all potentials—all light, all shadow. What you see in others that triggers you (positive or negative) is showing you something about yourself that you either deny or haven't integrated.

### Q: How do I stop judging others?

Remember: judgment violates their process. Only help when someone is open to receive. Otherwise, keep your "advice" as your own internal reflection. What you judge in them is what you judge in yourself.
