## Introduction

I have to. . . I have to.

. . I have to live next week.

Sorry. We were loving. How 's everything? As you have seen in Facebook and Instagram , we are here at joining , Join until.

. . Well , until my niece is born.

So , we are doing many things in this last few days.

So , let 's begin with the topic for today , which is Libre. This constellation. This group of stars is the one that is related to the third eye today , or our third eye day in the week of the emotional of Aquarium.

We are going to speak about this constellation today.

So , let 's begin just by looking at us in the idea of the history of Libre. Regarding the history of this , remember that the balance , the Libre , is one of the ancient tools , the ancient tools that we are used even in Egypt , to exchange things.

So , remember that in ancient times , they were not coined , they were not currency.

So , the only thing that was used was the carter , yes , to exchange things.

So , this way of economy made that we needed something to reach the value of things. And that value was according to the weight of things.

So , for example , if you have a piece of silver , and maybe that piece of silver has the same weight of 10 or 20 seats.

So , the 20 seats will have the same value as that piece of silver.

So , this is how they started to know how to exchange according to the weight of things. That 's why the balance , the tool , was really useful for economy first change. But what happened in Latin , in Rome , the Roman Empire , the weight of the things was called Libre. The name of the weight of the things.

So , one Libre would be like , which in English you call pound , would be like 12 ounces that represents 330 approximately 330 grams.

Okay , so this 330 grams are mostly the amount of weight of the things to measure the Libre.

So , that 's why the scale was used to weight Libre , which are this amount of grams.

Okay , so this is why it was so used in the time before we used currency.

So , even today , we still have the name Libre or pound to describe the currency according to the scale that they used to measure the weight , the value of things.

So , in another level , when we speak about the divine , the other levels of consciousness , the soul has also this scale , weight scale , which is that when we go into another dimension after we die , that traditions from the ancient world used to say that we had to face a final judgment , and this final judgment would be the one to put yourself in a scale. What do you have to put in both sides of the weight scale? In one , your truth , your mind , your beliefs , in the other one , what you feel , your passions , your emotions.

So , what you think is in your mind represented by a feather , and what you feel is represented by a heart.

So , both of them must be perfectly in the coherence.

So , you can go beyond , but if the heart weights much more , which means that you are very attached to the world , here comes the God , the Carpetile God , Said , and it 's the heart forcing you to be born again.

So , if you use the balance , you have to restart the whole thing.

So , just to understand this , this balance , this scale , was not to see which one was better. It was to find the balance between mind and heart. It 's not this one against this one , it 's not the thought , it 's balance.

So , that 's what we have to look for , that 's what they were trying to look for. To find the middle point.

So , of course , that in the ancient times , then this balance was , this balance was connected to everything. Everything had to be in balance , like between dark and light.

So , that 's what we are going to see now.

So , now , again , the reason why we put the name of Libre to this constellation is not because we thought that that constellation represents the balance. Because in October , when Libre is , we find the middle point in between the long days of the summer and the short days of winter.

So , we are in the middle point in between the light and the darkness. This is why October , when we were in the middle point of the balance of the longest days and the short days , we can see the sky and there was Libre constellation ruling that time.

So , that 's why we , as humans from our point of view , put the name to that constellation regarding the moment that we were living in this earth.

So , remember what we were talking yesterday. Libre constellation is not sending the vibes of Libre because the constellation means the way it 's scale. We named that constellation like this because of what was happening here. It is about perception , it is about our point of view.

So , now , let 's go into the family , the Trinity of this constellation. This is part of the , of the , of the Trinity of air. And air is all what is in the head.

So , we are relating these constellations this month with the elements in our body. And of course , from the voice to the top is related with the spirit which is the voice , the mind and everything that is ideas , etc. Related to the air. And remember that Libre represents the soul of this Trinity of the air.

## Energy Work

So , remember we had here the crown chara related to , to Aquarium which is the great mind and great idea. And then we have the soul which is the balance of the eyes , the balance of the ears , the balance of the nose of Libre , which is the soul in the middle. And then of course , we have Gemini in the body which is the manifestation of the word.

So , according to this Trinity , remember that Libre represents the soul which is the emotions. And the soul is made up with energy. We are energy.

So , the soul is all energy and the energy is moved by polarity. And what is polarity positive and negative?

So , the positive and the negative is the polarity that by magnetism allows the electrons to move faster and create the light to eat all the energy.

So , we are constantly moving , creating things by polarity.

So , that 's why Libre represents this balance between the positive and the negative.

So , now the energy that is polarity is the one that manifests creating the light , creating the colors , creating everything , it designs all the things.

So , polarity energy is the creator of all the things. And we need to to feel to manifest all these realities , the creation itself.

So , in order to do that , we need this duality positive and negative in order to find what to localized focus and find the reality.

So , we need this polarity in order to create something ahead and localized and see it. This is why in the reality , most of the things needs to be symmetrical. That 's why we have two eyes in order to see one image to ears in order to listen to one song. To nasal holes to smell , to parts of the tongue , to taste , to hands , to touch and perceive.

We need this duality , this symmetry in order to be able to experience to focus something outside. And that is why that is why we Libre represents this balance , the scale represents this harmony of the things in order to exist to create.

So , the energy of Libre is telling us that we need to symmetry in order to through polarity manifest things , create things. And in the other way , like this , this polarity , this polarity of Libre is showing me how I perceive the things that I have created.

So , Libre is a constellation that is constantly looking for the balance between what is on the sides and within and the outside.

So , the energy of Libre is the one that takes all the beauty from the outside to use it as something to bring beauty in the inside. And the beauty of the inside is used to manifest in art in the outside. One of the main goals of this constellation is to find all the colors between the dark and light , the blue , the white and the black.

So , Libre is the one that is going to perceive the arts of the creation , the beauty of the creation. The one that understands that all the colors are able to create through light , through sounds , through taste. And that 's how this sign received the information of the creation through what it sees , what tears , smells , taste and touches. Libre is the one that will teach us that if I find the way to use two opposite forces as one finding the middle point between both of them , I can find the place through where I can create manifest.

And the way that I find the way to use this is why Libre is also the way in which Libre is looking for this for its goal is by looking to the harmony of things. The balance of the things. It looks for the symmetry.

So everything can be perfect. Perfect , constantly.

So it can see any mistake in the creation.

So you can find the balance of all the things. And this is why justice is one of the attributes of Libre. Justice is to put everything in balance.

So we can perceive the right thing. This is why Libre brings understand justice as the look , as the seek for harmony in the universe.

So we start to relate with Libre as this constellation related to justice because we start to believe that justice is to understand that everything should be in harmony as we are able to find the harmony within. But what happened? Here 's when we start to go deep into the negative aspect of Libre.

So suddenly Libre , when it finds something that is unbalanced , but this Libre has no idea how to balance that again.

So that Libre will try to make the creations to put some beautiful things on the top of it to cover the ambulance thing.

So everyone can kind of see , oh that 's fine , that 's good. There is no way it it it it puts so much decoration is because this Libre has to find this balance in between to different things.

So usually this Libre does n't know exactly. Where is the wage that it needs to balance?

So it goes to this one and immediately that one loses strength.

So it says , oh no , I need to put balance here. Oh no , here , oh no here.

So it is constantly looking for the balance , but it does n't know exactly which one is the best one that I need to balance.

So doubt in decision is something really from Libre because it does n't really know how to balance that in which side is the best one.

So usually it 's very difficult for Libre to choose something if they are not in balance. If you are looking constantly for something that you do n't know how to put in balance.

So this is why when they do n't find exactly how to put it , they just put colors on it covers that thing and says , okay , nothing so anything it 's all good and they go away. The key of this Libre is that Libre is an artist is the one that knows how to use all the colors between black and white.

So it can create manifest things beautiful things for the world to find harmony and beauty in this in this world is the idealistic is the one that knows the best ideas to do something that is the best for everyone. But the thing is that if that Libre is unbalanced in chaos within.

So we 'll always try to look which option is the best one which color is the best one for this thing painting which shape is the best one for that which place is the best one to do this or that. You know it will be always trying to look for something that is perfect but will never find it because it does n't have the balance inside. If that Libre finds the balance within it would be able to become an artist and bring justice by harmony in this world.

So Libre also is a very good mediator. The one that helps to different options to speak. Because if we as Libre you can go into black and white in both and be able to listen to both and to understand both.

So it says to the to the white or this person I understand you and the other person that is fighting I understand you I understand your your position.

So both of you are right with well let 's try to talk to each other and to solve this problem is the one that mediates in between the two options okay which is totally the opposite to. The other side of the a sarojikar arko which is areas areas is the opposite to Libre and areas is the one that can not accept the balance between black and white for areas is or black. Either white.

So if areas is white let 's kill the black if areas is black let 's kill the white so that 's exactly the opposite.

So something that let 's go to understand why we need to understand the process of Libre in ourselves because we all have the energy of Libre within. Where do we have this Libre? Well , then everything that we see that we see outside is just a perception of what we have within and this means that we are going to judge everything that is around us according to our own perception of what is balance and what is and balance. This means that according to what for me is perfect harmony I will project this idea judging what for me is not perfect harmony.

So I will say this is wrong this is right according to my point of view not because that is really right wrong.

So the important thing about understanding Libre on us is that we are constantly trying to look for harmony in our life we are looking for the harmony constantly in our life. But we are not going to find it anytime if we are looking for it according through our own emotions and beliefs.

So we have to remember that everything that I look outside is just a perception of everything of how I look everything inside.

So just to practice how we can try to find this real balance. Try to think about the most horrible thing that you can possibly think about anything , any situation that you would judge like this is wrong or whatever. And think about it and try to find a solution for it in which you do n't have to judge any of the options any of the of the people involved. And you can find that perfect balance for both of them to have a perfect solution.

## Q&A

No judging any of both. Just finding harmony. How can we do that? Is a task for Libre.

So. Try to find a way. A perfect balanced Libre would find a way. No judging.

So it 's a difficult task that we have to to practice because if we are willing to build. As a society based on justice , we have to remember that justice is not about to judge someone is not about to punish. And that does something wrong. And to give an award to the person that does something good.

## Daily Practice Elements

The real justice is the one that can see and seek for harmony and beauty in everything that exists. Let 's go to the formation for today. The formation for today is ball. The statement for today is I am intellectual nourishment.

The code for today is the fire in the aspect of flame. At the same time , this part expanded over space as flames. That according to the wavelength acquired shades , colors that identified the flames. This way.

It was originated the concept of divine flames , the twin flames. And all the resonant energies which enlightened matter connecting the suns , burning worlds , cooking life from within the world and transmitting them in all directions and aspects.

So a few minutes ago it just started the new moon in Aquarium. Because today is a really important day to begin new things to manifest the ideas to become true. Let 's go to the blinded. I am tired because I was today will come early to go to the mountain and the mountain.

So it kind of kind of tired still.

So let 's see the comfortable. We close our eyes and concentrate in your breathing. I take my attention to every part that is symmetrical in my body. The beginning by my toes.

Feed. Legs. The fingers and arms. Legs.

Teeth. Nose. Ears. Eyes.

And from within. The brain. The lungs. Kindness.

Over is. Textiles. Every part of your body that is symmetrical reflected in harmony. Pay attention to it.

And take a deep breath.

Now I become aware that across the entire body I find an axis that holds all this duality. My spine. With each bear to run. Connecting to his core.

On his shoulders. Holding this scale. The balance of my body. I recognize that this time the axis of my world.

My body. I become the soul of the axis of the earth. And I feel how I myself become the entire planet earth. And its axis.

I recognize me. The polarity of the self and the north. The duality of the east and the west. Take a deep breath.

I feel the world divided in self and north by the equator. And divided by the east and west. Thunder Margin. I feel the north in my head.

In Greenland. The self in my feet. And Antarctica. The east.

In my right side. In my left side. And the west. I recognize that is duality and polarity that holds the beauty , the creation , the life , the balance and harmony in all the exist in this planet earth.

I become aware that this polarity is duality is the key to the balance and beauty of this world. And the only reason why there is chaos and destruction is only in the moments. Where this polarity loses its balance and axis. Take a deep breath.

I recognize them that the base of justice is not to erase one of the polities. But to find the balance , the harmony between both of them to manifest everything that exists. I recognize that all these all the things that exist are the colors in between the black and white , the day and the night. And that if I can read in the tune of the , if I can see the intelligence of the beauty of my art in this creation , I can tourism myself with harmony.

For I am intelligent and nourishment. I am intelligent nourishment. I am intelligent nourishment. I take a deep breath and I perceive in front of me in the deep space the stars of the constellation of Libre in front of my eyes.

With my hands I take the information from the stars so they bring me justice , balance and harmony and I take it as the nourishment for my intelligence which is to find my axis. I take the information from the stars of Libre in front of my eyes. I am harmony. Take it breath and each one at a time come back here and now.

Thank you everybody for being here as always and see you tomorrow at the same time.
