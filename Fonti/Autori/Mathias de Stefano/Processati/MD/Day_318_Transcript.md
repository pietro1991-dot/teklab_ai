## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good evening , good afternoon , how are you? I hope you are well here , beginning the day of our needs. And just to begin today , living behind the topic of appearances , if you look that I am wearing the same t-shirt , so yes , I did n't take a shower. And alone , nobody 's pushing me.

I 'm quiet , fine , so I do n't care. I 'm just saying that just in case you see me that I am wearing the same clothes every day , so do n't worry , okay , I 'm fine.

Today I just forgot the topic sorry. It is communion , communion , the common union.

So let 's talk about this topic , what is communion?

Today in this hotel we have a lot of communion because we have two weddings today , two weddings. One at each side of the hotel.

So I think it is a very easy topic today.

So communion comes from two words that is common and union. Come on comes from common which is way of saying the way , the way in which you do things like which is a way of doing things and union that comes from Uno , meaning one.

So it 's easy to understand one way.

So we have here that communion is basically only one way of doing the things. There would be a communion.

So acknowledging that the unity , the way of being one , the concept of communion , this comes from the time when a lot of people from different point of view go together to look for one way of doing the things.

So they sat down and they decided to how to connect their different ways and to put them together so they could do only one thing.

## Energy Work

So we can tell from communion that it 's not something human , it 's something from nature. All in nature has the same thing. We can find communion in trees and fungus in the nature world. We can find how the world of fungi helps the plants to tourism the roots.

So they grow stronger. We can find this communion in between the insects and the plants that they take , the insects take what they need from the plants and plants use the insects to make pollination. Also when we look for , when we watch the animals , they create this communion in the herds that they share to one another.

So many types of communion we can see in nature. It 's all about it 's all about that. It 's all about this symbiosis in nature that we can create that we can do all the things that we do.

So as you see communion is not something from religion or something from society or humanity , it 's a very natural thing in all the realms for all the realms that share one common goal that unites them in a goal , a specific objective.

So acknowledging this from nature we will now understand very well why humans we use the word communion very much in our cultures. When we try to see the point of view of humans , according to communion , we have to remember that we humans come from mammals , we are mammals that live in herds. We are homicide.

So throughout our history we we organize ourselves in herds and this herds started to be called also a clan and a family.

So we started to get together to take care to one another.

So we are all safe and one.

So in order to do that we have to find different tools that helps us to identify to each other.

So symbolism , words , colors , stuff that we all could share and we all could understand that if we see those things we belong to that.

So a family a clan heard use these symbols in order to find themselves secured.

So if you see that you know oh I 'm safe because I am part of this okay.

So along history where we started to do with this community concept of unity is that we started to find ways in which the different individuals can be attached and connected to only one concept. This was helpful because that made us belong to something that made us feel part of something.

So that 's why if we saw the same the same colors the same symbols we could belong. We could know that it 's safe to be in this group.

So this concept of a common way of doing things created the idea that all these kind of different individuals they are one. They are not different beings that you have to call by their or name but they are only one being all together. And this created the idea of being one as a family , being one as a clan and also created the idea of cultures , of nationalism in which you can kind of share the same things the same ways of doing something with many others. It does n't matter if it 's just two people or a thousand people they can share the same thing and be called as one.

So for example when you speak about the nervous system okay so you have millions of cells that are called neurons that each one of them administrated a kind of information but all of them together are called the nervous system or the brain.

So it 's much more easy to say the brain than to name each one of the neurons of course so it would be impossible.

So it 's the same thing happened when we say for example I am an Argentinian.

So I can say who I am but when I say Argentinian you kind of can think about a common concept of what an Argentinian is so you say an Argentinian like a whole concept okay like one being.

So that 's what communion is. It 's when different individuals get together to share one way of doing things.

So that way is much more stronger than it was before when everyone was separated.

So throughout history the first thing that happened with this communion is a community from the families , from the clans , a community is born.

So when a community is born it is because different individuals that get together to share the work , to share their ideas , their food , to share the place where they leave they start to share different attributes in order to have the same common goal which is to survive to be happy to live as long as they can.

So it would be only one object that they all share as a community.

So once we have this community , eventually humanity starts to spread and get wider.

So these different communities , they have to get together and they create something new a transcendental from each one of the communities because they have a lot of them spread around.

So what they create is what we call a nation. A nation is basically something that connects many communities in only one topic , in only one union.

So all of them are born from the same topic. For us today is easy to say for example that something that creates a nation is the day of independence. But that 's really a very new point of you. In the ancient times a nation was not born because of a day of independence.

A nation was born because they shared the same language or the same land or they were sharing a common history or a war , I do n't know , something that happened for all of them together that they can relate to as one as the same origin.

So that was the birth of a nation. Nation means birth , the birth of something bigger , greater.

So that 's the terminology of the word.

So that 's how it begins.

So if our community is a group of people that are bound together as one , so a nation is a conjunction of communities that they get together as one.

So a nation can be united by different political systems. Like for example a kingdom , can unite a nation , an empire , a community , the dictatorship , democracy , a republic , any system can unite a nation.

So in the first time these communities this communion was divided to protect the individuals of each group.

So for example we have the community A that they were dressed as red and the community B that were dressed as blue. If the individuals would mix , they would know which law was applied to each one of them.

So they would know where they could be safe.

So the same thing happened with the nations according to the flags. Different colors , different flag was useful to understand in which community are we born with , so which laws in which system would apply to you and where do you feel safe.

So we have to remember that this is how this is the concept of how flags and countries and nations and colors that divide us were born. From our point of view today it does n't make any sense. It 's like weird and why they separate us and so on. But this is because we are ready in this lifetime right now we are becoming aware that this is not really necessary because we are transcluding this in globalization we are all together united and it does n't really matter now.

So we are transcluding this topics that in the first time in the very ancient time this was something really useful because if you step in a place that you should not walk through the other ones could kill you because you were a threat for them.

So when you see when you would see the same colors that you were born with or these kind of things the same words , the same ceremonies or whatever.

So you can feel protected you feel that you are home , you are safe.

So it was really useful in the beginning in the first time in order to feel safe to be part of something. We had different ways to understand these communes , these communities. We could say that the first communities were created to protect themselves from others but eventually some of these communities started to grow and grow.

So they took another point of view not to protect the ones that were in the family but to invade and to provoke the others to be part of their family.

So that was the really great problem that instead of taking care of your own you thought that we thought that we were the best ones so everyone should be like us.

So that 's why they started to expand and as many they were much more unity they took the flags or the symbolism , the symbols to take power over the others. This was basically the basement of every country that existed today.

So these kind of communities created all the countries that we have today. This system was the basement that created all the countries that we have today and this is how we started to create the concept of nationalism , nationalism where movements that tried to push many individuals as possible to have a common idea of what it is to be.

So they could be much more stronger in front of the other ones and to separate and to identify who we are in front of others.

So basically nationalism was something really good at first time because it helped to people to feel safe in the time when they were creating the countries.

So it was really good for that. But eventually nationalism became a kind of a cult , a cult in which people could n't be different. Otherwise there would be a judgment to acknowledge to know who if you belong to the group or if you deserve to die or to be expelled from the group.

Today nationalism are something really wrong for our planet because it creates the false idea that we have to be united and defend ourselves from someone. And nationalism are really easy to handle to manipulate by symbolism. For example , I can not speak about nationalism from other countries because I did not leave the history of other countries but I can tell from my own country , Argentina. In Argentina we usually we have a history of community that was forced to be Argentinian.

There were regional people from the territory was forced to be named as Argentinian where forced to be called Argentinian even if they were not because they were native from their own regions. And the rest of the country in the late 800s where they came in boats from Europe and they were forced to be called Argentinian. They were forced to create the idea of a nation that was n't existing. It did n't exist.

Argentina was just an idea of a few people and the rest of the people were forced to be called Argentinian.

So they brainwashed all the people in order to become Argentinian , for example. And we have been so brainwashed that all the nation , all the people in Argentina used to say that we have been colonized by the European people. And I 've been not colonized by European people because I am European. You can see my green eyes , my white skin , I am from Europe.

So the only thing is that just my grand grand father came and took some land and I was born there. But I was born in a territory that someone called Argentina. But the people that used to leave there were not Argentinian.

So just a tiny part of our country today , the native people , they were not Argentinian. They were the only ones that were living there actually. And they were forced to be inside a country called Argentina. And we from Europe were forced to become Argentinian with an ideal than we are part of an ancient that did n't exist.

So nationalism used to put us used to put us into the same box of an ideology , even using symbolism and so on. Against other countries that we have no problem with.

So it does n't have any sense. It might have had a temporary use and goal , but now it does n't have that meaning anymore.

So other things that nationalism used to do is to create false problems that does n't affect anyone of us. But they create this kind of conflict in order to unify a nation that is breaking up or taking a different course. Because some people are a threat of new things of transforming into new things.

So they create false conflicts in order to create fear that attached and unified the nation against something from the outside. And nationalism used to do this alone a lot. We have seen this for example in the states where Donald Trump was creating false enemies in the outside and even inside the country trying to unified population on someone. To unified us one the nation.

The same thing happened in Germany in the 30s.

So this happened many times all the time creating false conflicts in order to create nationalism that unified the countries that are breaking up. And it always has to be about creating a false and outer enemy.

So for example today we have COVID and everyone is talking about COVID and COVID and all this conflicts. But there is no no terrorism anymore. What happened with the terrorism? Like it is not that there is no terrorism or that someone invented the reason.

Of course there are. But there has been a lower terrorism because there is no much ability or allowing much more terrorism. This kind of things.

So again coming back to my countries and example sometimes historically some of the things that happen can also create distortions in our own ideas. For example I do n't know if you know the story but for sure you have heard about the Fallin Islands and the War with England. And those islands , the Fallin Islands and sorry for those who who believe that they are Argentina but those islands were never Argentine in history never. And sometimes people used to say but they are in our territory.

If they are in our territory so we can also reclaim Chile we can reclaim Uruguay , Paraguay we can reclaim all South America everyone because it is in our territory.

So it does n't make any sense historically for Argentina to reclaim a land that it was no ours. Never in history.

So so this created from the war since the war it created an idea that we people in Argentina has to be against the English people the British because they took a land that was ours and and this kind of things and everyone thinks that they are ours.

So it creates a common idea that brainwashed the history and that makes us believe some stuff that never happened really. And that is one of the things that makes communion something wrong in our daily times. And if we want to talk about communion in a very deeper way we have to go now to religion. Religion is one of the greatest communion that has been created in history because many of the symbolism of religion has gone throughout borders.

They went out of the countries like for example christians has gone through all entire Roman countries in Europe and the Islam has gone through all northern African and Asia countries.

So so it is spread beyond the limits.

So it 's much stronger communion than others. The the community in our religion was because there should be something greater that united us God.

So the idea of being brothers and sisters under the eyes of God is something that united much more people besides the nations.

So the reason why the communion is much stronger in religion is because the nations are born in the past , are born in history. But we all are going to die.

So we all are looking towards the future. And faith is talking to us about why it 's coming next.

So that 's why religions are much more stronger in communion because they are thinking about what is going to happen after death.

So this idea of communion is born in this sense. This concept of communion is related to the sense of belonging to something to someone. Because to belong to something makes us feel secure. It 's something from nature.

Something very old. It 's not all human. Communion is something that brings us the idea , the sense of belonging to a group , to a religion , to a culture , to a nation , to a conscience. It is about belonging somewhere to feel secure.

Safe. And this is something that takes us to look for symbols that can unite us , ideas that can unite us. This is the concept of creating symbols that can unite topics and information is very natural in humans or humanity.

So symbols like this , like the symbol that I did for the you saw the MP , are symbols that helps us to make a summary in just an image of all the concepts and a lot of information that we could not explain , but we can share just by looking at it. And also we can relate to the others , to the people when we connect with them. When we see that the other one has the symbol , we can feel connected and know who to talk to and what to talk to or about.

So the conflict here is not the symbol itself. Symbols are good , are information. The conflict here is believing that I belong to that symbol. It 's to feel attached to that symbol.

So for example , I can wear the cross , the Christian cross , and maybe it 's because I can relate to others with the same religion. But I can also be open to others. I can also be open to different points of view and to different philosophies in life. The real conflict here is when we use the symbols with fear , feeling a threat of not being part of something.

Symbols , flags , colors , history , nations , traditions , cultures , countries , they all are symbols , information , data that summarizes many things. But just that , we can not feel attached to that. We can not say I belong to that symbol. Otherwise we are not free.

We are not ourselves. They are just information. We can not leave our lives through those codes. We just ca n't use them for something to relate with the others.

But that 's it.

So the sentence that I 'm said to me today , I guess it 's really clear for this. We have to live behind the sense of belonging , of pertinent , and to have a sense , a meaning.

So it 's not that we are looking for belonging to something. That 's very animal , very mammal. We are looking to survive belonging to something.

So what we have to discover is that inside of us , we are already belong. And from there find a meaning , a sense.

So for example , what we are doing here , the main idea of this is for you not to belong to this network of the I am. It 's not that after all these you still belong. And you say I am part of this network of the I am. No.

The main idea of this is for you to use the I am to belong to yourself. Not to anything outside. Actually in the age of a queries , we will be giving much more to others , belonging to ourselves than belonging to a network.

So this is one of the things that we have to work very inside with ourselves.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the vibration for today is too. The statement today is I am energy of manifestation. The code today is love and rage. One of the most known by polities in the human world is the one that lays in the orbit.

Its vibration irradiates the positive and negative waves that draw the most expanded emotion. In its positive aspect love that means eternity. And implies the ability of not having limits when feeling without conditions or dependencies. Love is the motion of freedom and acceptance.

Meanwhile rage is the other side of love where there are conditions , where it 's not accepted the other ones freedom and that in presence , me too. In this emotion , everything is limited.

Remember that one of the most important communion that must be given in our life is the one between the I and I.

So it 's comfortable closing eyes and concentrating in your ratings. I take you to the breath. I become aware of the place I find myself in. I become aware of the country in the city where I am.

I take you moment to feel to perceive what sensations I receive , I acknowledge in which country I find myself in. See all the body how it feels here. Try to move every joint , every part of the body softly , your head and circles. Recognize me.

## Q&A

How do you feel in this position? And I make the question do I belong to this place? I take a deep breath and I try to think to feel to which country I belong , which city I belong , to which space I belong. I try to think about the people that is around me in this place.

And think if you belong to this people and if not , take a deep breath , bring into you the people where you belong. I am here. All the people that corresponds to me in the place where I belong. I am dying to come aware of this here and now.

There it is! Is here now where I find the community , it Saint-Puti the Jesus And in this connection I realize that I do n't belong to any place and to anybody.

So there only reason I can feel that I am fine in this place with this people is the inner connection of this community of I and I. Where I can feel her she walks out of this details under the temple of this incident. I imagine that I hear myself land of ego and insults me , I can see the am , the essence. And everything that is around me , the place that people are just a reminder that I and are the only possible and real community in my life.

Just saw it , I hear it. Just saw it , and this thing will look , here and now , I am in this world without belonging to it. And this from this community , from which I really can manifest. I extend my hands receiving the hand of I and I , ceiling here , the community between myself and take it to the ground and activate it.

I am the energy of manifestation , I am the energy of manifestation. I think I think I think. And this is my community , I am. And spirit of the formula.

I take the deep breath , each one of the times , come back here and now. Thank you everybody for being here and that 's it. And as always , see you tomorrow at same time.
