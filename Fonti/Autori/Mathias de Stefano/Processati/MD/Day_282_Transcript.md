## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So now the day that we gather here for the day of the third eye , the emotional week of Torres. And because today is painting and all the colors , so I came with all the colors from the NA. Let 's begin. I was saying yesterday , the idea of talking about arts this week is because we have been building the house , which is our home with the fire inside.

And this home , this fire , is related with our soul.

So our soul is the inner fire that activates the potential that we have with them in order to manifest it in the outside. And Torres is the energy that manifests. Talking about the soul of Torres , it is related to the arts , to the manifestation of the inside the inner world. This is why the proposal for this week is to work in the understanding of the main arts , the main inspirations of the music.

So we can understand how they work in ourselves , how they appear in the world and what importance they have in our inner world , in our inside.

So we can understand what they mean for us.

So and here , before we start with all this week of the arts , I would like to say to you that do n't think or do n't say , I do n't know to do that. And in the other hand , do n't say , I already know how to do this. How to do this. And I 'm really good at it.

Why not to say either of those? Because the people that say , I do n't know how to do this is not that you do n't know how to do this. It 's because you think that you need a technique or to know in order to manifest something. And basically , it 's not like that.

Basically , in order to manifest art , you just have to feel it. You just have to express what you have within. It 's not about technique. It 's not about being a great artist to do art.

What you just have to do is to express and to play with it , to be original with it. Arts is not about technique. Techniques are thousands of them. And every artist follows the different techniques.

So it 's not about that. It 's about what you want to express.

So that 's the main thing that we have to to understand in order to make art. And in the other hand , those who know how to do art and have the technique have to be always open to have to be always open to know that there is much things and many things more to understand to learn from what we do. It 's not only about the technique is also about what we have to understand from what we do. The transcendental idea of what this art means and not only to do it properly.

So why I say this about not thinking about the technique exactly when we are talking about art. Because technique comes from the Greek technique that means beauty means to have a shape or something that is perfect. It 's something that is beautiful in some , in some , how.

So technique was used in order to have a structure in what you kind of painting or doing. But the technique starts to be a way in which you design the things or the beauty you are doing. But actually what I am trying to say here is that in order to take a technique and to practice a technique and to have a technique for yourself , you have to discover your own technique which is to discover your own beauty. Which means that for some people , the technique is or the beauty and the technique are to paint a very hyper realistic sizing for example.

And for some others , this would be , I do n't know , crisis or just whatever lines or whatever.

So what we have to do , sometimes it 's to think that maybe it 's not a beautiful sightseeing that brings the soul from outside. Maybe it 's also sadness , it 's also chaos. And we have to discover first our own technique before we can understand other techniques and to improve in those other techniques.

So for example , when we want to improve ourselves with another with other techniques , like to learn how to do it in different ways , this means that we have to position ourselves in the body , in the motion of someone else or in or of something else. Which means that we have to be in that same connection or that same level in order to have that connection with the art.

So this means that what we have to do first is to express what we have within , express the art that we have inside and then after that we can start to manage other kinds of technique by improving ourselves and learning from the motions of others.

So of course , there are people that were born with the gift of doing something.

Some people that have to practice the whole life in order to do something , but to be born with the gift , it does n't make you better. To be born with the gift , it means that you have practiced this in other lives or that you inherited from your family , your NA. You have the skills to do that , but it does n't make you there. What really , sometimes some people that takes a long time to practice and years to practice , they can become better than the ones that have the gift.

But it 's all about practicing and to allow yourself to express the will of what you have inside. A lot of people paint , but some people are painters and there are many painters but just a few are artists. And what I mean with this , that we can paint , we can do things , of course , and also we can have really good techniques that makes us painters.

So good painters. But within the painters , there are just a few that are artists , that are the ones that you can see them in everything that they do. That you just have to take a look at it to understand who they are. Like for example , Dalit.

When you see a frame made by Dalit , you do n't need to see that there is Dalit 's sign there. You kind of see it and then say , oh that 's Dalit. Why? Because the artist is painting the soul , the soul of itself.

It 's not painting for others , it 's not painting for it to be beauty. It 's not painting for anyone else , it 's painting painting for itself.

So you can see the artist in the painting. You can identify them just by looking at anything and that 's because the soul was imprinted in that. This is important to get to understand , in order for us to see that the only way in which you can become an artist is by connecting with yourself , by being yourself and saying , I am. When you go within with the power of your soul , of course that we are mammals.

So we need to imitate the techniques of others in order to improve , to move around in environment. But we have to use that environment and those tools as something that helps us to find our originality.

So we can say that nobody is bad at anything. We are basically mammals looking for our originality.

So once that this , let 's talk about painting. Painting is basically the art that is born from light , from the interpretation of light , which is that we receive the light towards our eyes. We perceive it in our brain.

So we interpret it , the light that comes from the outside to inside , to understand our inner world. And to understand the world.

So we have two ways in which we will express this light. One , receiving it from the outside to understand the environment and the other one , would be to express the inner light that we have towards the outside , which is to manifest that light to the world.

So we receive from the outside to mold the inside and then through painting , we take the colors from the inside and we project it into the outside.

So painting is the way in which we can send data of information , information in shape of data of codes to the world.

So now , by our eyes.

So now let 's try to understand why is that.

So in order to understand this , we have to about the information. We have to remember something that we have spoken about last year , I guess , related to the wavelength of light.

So first of all , we have , I guess , that we have mainly three ways of receiving light and to proceed light. The first one is the one that is created in the chemical reactions of the suns and the stars like the sun for us. The other one would be the bioluminousens , which is created by some animals and some insects in nature. And the other one is the electricity , which is created by , as you see , the lightning or the currents of electricity that we do for our buildings and so.

And of course , I forgot the fire , of course , that that creates light through the chemical reaction of the of the marketing carbon.

So let 's take any source of light. See , remember this that we have a source of light and this light moves through the space in a wave. We have a wave here and during this waves , there are particles that move that we call photons. The photons are photons basically means light in Greek , photon.

So those are the particles that move through this.

Remember that all this is called vibration. And remember this that the waves has up , down , up , down , up , down.

So the periods that it takes to go from one side to another is what we call frequency. Frequency is how frequent they repeat. How frequent they repeat. That 's the difference between vibration and frequency.

Okay.

So this wavelength , we will divide it into nano meters.

So now imagine this that here we have one , two and three. That are frequent.

So we have frequency three. Here we have one , two , three , four.

So we have frequency four. Here changes and start to have frequency five for example.

So this is just as an example because what really is happening that is that the frequency tells that you have a amount of time in between one and another.

So why we have to say here is that we would say the opposite.

So imagine this now to see a better that from one aspect of the wave to the other we for example have to count until five.

So one , two , three , four , five. One , two , three , four , five. One , two , three , four , five. And that repeats one again.

One 's again.

So it 's the frequency five. And now here we have less.

So we can go through the wave and we will see that we have here four here three.

So one , two , three , four. One , two , three , four.

So it repeats.

So it 's a frequency. Frequency because it repeats itself all the time.

Now each one of these five is a barometer.

So imagine that this is the wave length of the wave.

So in the wave length I have here five nanometers. Here we have four nanometers. Here we have three nanometers in each one of the frequencies.

So now if we see this wavelength we have here one , two , three , four. But here we start to repeat one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten. Yes , we have more.

So what this means that this is low frequency and this is high frequency. One represents that low frequency is that you have lower amount of repetitions and higher frequency is that you have a lot of repetitions. Many of them.

So I 'm explaining this because we in this spirituality and the world of the consciousness we used to say you have a high vibration or you by weight so low. And I rebound on this this frequency we need to to have a leap of frequency. And sometimes we have no idea what it means.

Okay so it 's it 's important to understand these difference so you can get.

So a person that violates low is a person that leads really slow that you can kind of predict what is going to happen next because he 's really slow and predictable.

So good to know that low vibration is not bad. Low vibration is just that is predictable. Like for example , tortoise. A tortoise is a very slow animal.

So it 's predictable , it 's really slow. It has to sleep five months or six.

So it 's not bad at tortoise. It 's a good being.

Okay so so it 's like having lower rhythm.

Okay and for example in the other hand we have a hummingbird which is a very fast process. When we create this idea that vibrating low is wrong. It happens when our environment is changing where the things are changing in my life and I are not changing. I am doing exactly the same.

So it creates an opposition between the two energies from the outside and inside that creates a conflict that brings me into the seas because or bad emotions or being sad or whatever because my vibration is still low and my environment is vibrating high.

Okay that 's the conflict that we can have. That 's why we believe that vibrating low is a bad thing but it 's not.

Okay so in the same way as we live our abs and downs. The fault of particles they also live their abs and downs.

So these particles that are living exactly the same as we live in different abs and downs are all the ways of frequency from the light which is white.

So when they reach our eyes and they reflect in our eyes the wavelength starts to be perceived by the brain in the different nanometers the different frequencies acid arrives towards to us and that interpretation of the wavelength is the one that gives us the idea of colors.

So this means that the colors are not outside are inside are within. The colors are basically the interpretation of our brain of these waves that are hitting the matter.

So the colors are from our interpreted inside.

## Q&A

So now the question would be why do we see all of us this white blue because this is not really blue. It means that the chemical the components that we have here inside that we can see the blue. The components that are there the pigments that it has has a shape , a structure in the physical structure that reflect the light. The reflect the light in different wavelengths.

So for example the structure can be this like this 90 degrees of structure or this or this or this.

So the light will hit the structure in different ways.

So when it comes back to us by this reflection we will see different colors that why we see all the same color.

So for example the people that is the tonic that can see all the colors is basically because the eyes , the eyes can not see the whole spectrum of light. The spectrum of light is smaller.

So imagine that these people can see only this but they can not see this one. They can not perceive this wavelength because their eyes are not has a problem that are not 100 % open to receive the waves , wavelengths.

So this.

So that 's why they confuse colors because they only see a few colors. Here with colors happens exactly the same. Each color will be like kind of a word , a packaging information inside this language of colors.

So when you mix those colors and create new ones it 's like if you are creating words and stories poetry and so on.

So a lot of information just by mixing colors.

So when we receive the colors from the outside we are receiving data from the light straight from the universe.

So for example you have heard for sure the information of the wide ray , the blue , the green , the yellow ray , the pink ray , the masters that represent those rays are colors.

So for example the colors are given us in our sub-conscious and unconscious. The colors gives us information all the time that we are not aware of. Like for example all these colors that we relate with emotions because those colors were present in situations or situations or trauma that we have lived. For example the blue , the colored blue for some people can represent calm , disguise , opening , but for other people can represent fear and cold.

So it depends on how you perceived that color in the situations that you perceive.

So we relate colors with emotions. We relate colors with situations that we live with data.

So for example we can relate their color red with intensity and things that are bad. Like when someone correct us and they correct the things with red , x or cross or we see the light in the streets. When we see the devil painted in red , when we see the lava of the volcanoes we relate the hell with the red.

So we culturally has been designed also into understand the red as something that maybe can be but. This depends on the culture and depends on what the person has lived. It 's not general.

So basically the colors has the data information of what emotions represent for us and how we relate with the world.

So we can understand now that we are constantly receiving data in the outside. We are all the time receiving information.

So eventually in human history after we receive all this data from the outside , we discover that we have things within to share to the world too. And we take those emotions and grab these colors from the outside that we relate with those emotions and start to express it in the outside to tell what happens within. And that 's painting.

So in history what people used to do before using the colors , they used to carve the rocks and let some marks in the rock. Martin rocks and making some markings in the rock. European languages even say pig which in Latin is picta. Pinto is to carve rocks.

But eventually they started to put some things , some colors from the environment that they created to to difference the carvings that they did. And that 's what we call picamentum. Picamentum is the things that you put on the carvings. And from picmentum we have painting.

So what is to paint is to give live a mark into the outside to tell what is within into the outside to give to live it 's card in the world.

So give live mark in the world. And remember this here is the light that we receive as a wavelength into our brains through our eyes.

So remember that the sun , the light from the outside arrives to our eyes also sata. But we are also light. We are made with photons and electrons. We have our own light within that we call the soul.

So we can also from within take that wavelength outside and express through the colors the soul that we have within.

So basically all history of art is basically humans interpretation the light that come from outside and designing it from the light that is within. My advice regarding this topic is for you to show your own lights , your inner lights into the outside to express them. It does n't matter if it 's just some marks or whatever , of colors but just allow yourself to express the colors from within the motions from your soul. Let 's go to the information for today.

Remember that also in the post today in the blog. I wrote about the meaning of the colors and how they appear and also the history of arts.

So you can have an idea of it. The vibration for today is raw. This thing meant for today is I am guardian of consciousness. The code for today is fungi.

Closer to animals than to plants , the kingdom of fungi extends today versus environments and ecosystems. Being this modest one and fundamental unicillular for food like yeast and other prosthetic ones that feed from waste. Of dietary character , poisonous , involved in this composition , parasite , alusinogenic , this kingdom of creatures covered with kitten that share with our farther boats , has the fundamental function of the composing organic matter and turning it into manure. Sit comfortable , close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing.

Stichety breath and become aware of the space that surrounds you , the body that inhabits and your own breathing. I start to use my own imagination to make all the objects around me disappear. One by one I start to perceive how they vanish. All of them I become aware of each one , every furniture , every tool , until the walls starts to disappear , the roof and the floor vanish.

There is nothing else but void and just myself in the center of it. And avoid I take all my attention into only one spot , put in all my focus into that dish and thus beyond these objects. I watch with all intention this thought until I can perceive how it starts to be knighted into spark that expands in many others creating fire that grows until it bright. Expand in light and dies start to feel its heat in my skin.

And I recognize that this fire is the fire of my soul , the core that I can use to create my home , the home of my soul , the home of my dreams. I take my hands to the fire and very smooth and slowly I start to assign my home around me. From this light , from this fire slowly stretching the body with soft movements as if you are dancing. Start to the side from the fire , the walls of this house , the floor , the roof , the garden , every room , and all the furniture.

I start to recognize that this house is myself my soul. Every room is a charcoal and orange , the walls my skin , the basement , my bones. And I take this fire and from its light I start to paint the house with colors , the start to put all the colors in every room , painting , memories in the walls , emotions. Recognizing which places in this house are much more colorful , the witch plants are lower and darker.

I use my hands to paint with this fire , all this house with all this colors. I become aware that this colors are my own emotions and feelings. They are the soul manifested the conscience of the soul and I look at myself as the guardian of this consciousness of this home. I am the guardian of conscience.

I am the guardian of conscience. I have these conscience in me. I am the guardian of conscience. I am the guardian of conscience.

Thank you for being here another day.
