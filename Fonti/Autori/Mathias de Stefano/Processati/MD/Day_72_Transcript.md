## Overview

Today continues the **Emotional Week of Libra**, working with the **Third Eye chakra**. We're exploring another pair of concepts that seem opposite but are actually complementary: **Remember and Oblivion (forgetting)**.

Before we dive in, Matías shares a personal note about Mercury retrograde—we're in a period of communication challenges. He acknowledges feeling tired, having a weird day, doing the same routine daily since July 25th. This human vulnerability reminds us that even teachers experience the cycles and difficulties of the path.

**Remember and Oblivion** are deeply connected concepts. In our society, we value remembering highly—we're told to remember history, to remember lessons, to never forget. Memory is seen as a virtue, while forgetting is seen as weakness or ignorance.

But today we'll discover a revolutionary perspective:

**Remembering is not about going to the past to retrieve information. Remembering is about putting together the parts you already have within to create meaning.**

And **oblivion (forgetting) is not a failure—it's the tool that allows you to be fully present, to be in the here and now without the weight of past and future conditioning your essence.**

Both are necessary. Both are sacred. Both serve the evolution of consciousness.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology of Remember

Let's begin with the origin of the word "remember."

**Remember comes from the Latin: RE and MEMBRARE.**

- **RE** = to go back to, to do it again
- **MEMBRARE** = parts, members (like members of the body, members of a congregation)

**So remembering means: to join all the parts that are separated.**

All the different concepts that were divided through the experience, through life, through history—we have been dividing them as different memories.

All these memories, when you try to remember, must be put together. We should put them all together in order to see them, to make a logic of all of them.

**That's what remembering means: to unite all these different parts, to make a logic of them.**

In Spanish, we call this "recordar," which means **"to come back to the heart."** They thought that the center where everything could be joined is the center of a person, which is the heart.

### The Etymology of Oblivion

In the other hand, to forget—we're going to use the word **oblivion**.

**Oblivion comes from the Indo-European word that means "slippery."**

Picture this: like moss on a rock in a cave, where everything is dark and there's a lot of humidity, and a person can fall down because of the slippery rocks.

**You fall into the darkness of the cave.**

This is basically what oblivion means: **to fall down, to lose the balance.**

For the ancient ones, oblivion meant **to lose the balance, to lose the point of reference where you are, and fall into the darkness because you cannot have a point of reference.**

### The Cultural Perception

**To make a summary:**

**If remembering is to see the different parts and put them together in my axis**, then **to forget is to lose the axis and not be able to see the different parts.**

Our society is based on the will of remembering. For us, to remember is important because we need to understand history, not to forget what happened. Having memories is important.

This is why we always hear: "Remember! You have to remember! It's important to remember!"

And to forget, oblivion, is seen as ignorance.

### Matías' Personal Example: The Gift of Remembering

Matías shares his personal experience:

**"I remember everything I've done before I was born. I can remember my past lives, everything I did."**

Many people ask: "How can I remember like you do?"

His answer is profound:

**"It's very difficult to explain exactly how, because I didn't do a process to remember—it was something I was born with."**

He compares it to someone born with the gift of music. Some people are born musicians. Others study and practice for years to become musicians. Both can play instruments, but for the person born with the gift, it's difficult to explain "how" because they just know.

**"When people tell me, 'How can I remember like you do?' I would say: First try to figure out what is your own gift. Maybe you're losing time trying to imitate others because you think that is good. But the best way is to awaken your own gift, because you have it there constantly with yourself. Trying to imitate others, you just lose a lot of time."**

This is a crucial teaching about spiritual comparison and authentic development.

### What Remembering Really Means

Here comes the breakthrough understanding:

**Your gift is a part of yourself. So all you have to do is start to put the different parts of yourself together.**

When you start gathering all the different parts that you never pay attention to and you put them together, you start to give them a meaning, a sense. You understand the logic of all that.

**And that process IS remembering.**

**Remembering is precisely that: to give a logic to all the parts that I have within that are disordered or separated.**

**So remembering is not about remembering history. It's not about knowing what happened in other lives or in the cosmos. Remembering is to be able to connect all the different parts that I have for myself and to put them together, to connect them again so I can see the logic of all of that.**

Sometimes Matías doesn't remember by "going to the past." He remembers because he's able to **connect the dots of things that are separated**. He understands the logic, and suddenly everything opens and you can understand the memory of it.

### How the Brain Creates Memories

To understand how this works, we have to understand how the brain works.

**The brain is like a computer.** It's a computer that registers data constantly, all the time. It's writing information all the time.

But the brain has many folders or boxes where it puts all the information.

**You have:**
- A box of smells
- Another one of colors
- Another one of feelings

The brain takes one smell, one color, and one feeling and puts them together. It creates a **memory**—which comes from the word "memo" (information, data).

**Memory is data, information all together.**

**Remember would be: to take the information from the smell, the color, and the feeling, and put them together, creating a memory.**

**The process of putting together a memory—we call it "remember."**

### The Revolutionary Understanding

**We have to understand this:**

**Remember is NOT something that your brain does by going to the past to look for information.**

**What your brain does is take the information of the data that you have from those experiences and put them together.**

**Remembering is not going to the past to bring memories.**

**Remembering is the action of looking for information that you already have within, already organized in your brain, and putting it together into memory so you can understand what happened.**

**Remembering is to give logic to something that happened.**

But not only what happened—also all the things and data that maybe have a relation with what you're trying to solve.

### Remembering Other Lives: The Oneness of the Universe

The question comes: How is it possible that you can remember other lives, other beings, or whatever?

**We have to remember everything we've spoken in previous videos: there is no such thing as "other." The universe is constant. Everything is one.**

**There are not "other lives." It's only ONE LIFE being expressed in different shapes.**

This helps us understand that whatever we remember is information, data, that is not only ours—**it's from the whole world.**

Even the water you drink every day was also drunk by a dinosaur someday.

**That's why we can remember everything. We are not separated beings. We are a constant of the universe.**

When Matías says he remembers, it's information from the whole universe, from everything.

**The information is in the atoms, in the energy of atoms. And my atoms are the same atoms that are also in the stars.**

**We are stardust.**

**From the very beginning, we are the memory of the universe.**

We ARE memory because we are data of the universe, information.

**This is why we can remember whatever we want—because within ourselves, we have the information of whatever.**

### The Law of Resonance in Memory

**The only way I can remember information is if I am in the same frequency and vibration of that information.**

We can only perceive one information if we have to be in the same vibration as that information in order for it to be seen, to be remembered.

This works like buildings very close to each other with many windows, many layers. You'll be able to see the layer in front of you of the other building because you're very close to it. If you change your floor, you'll see different information, a different perspective.

**This is what happens with the universe.**

**According to which level you are in, which information you are aligned to, you will have a perception and information specifically to your level.**

To remember is to put the different parts together. **I will only be able to put together those parts that I can see, that I can resonate with.**

**I will be able to remember only according to the resonance, the vibration that I have.**

### Experiencing the Same Event Differently

We used to remember according to the perceptions that our tree of life has experienced.

**Example:** If your tree of life has experienced the good part of Atlantis when everything was great, you will remember having very good memories of Atlantis.

But some other person who maybe lived the flood and the end of Atlantis will have passed the information through the cells that they lived the horrible part of Atlantis. That other person will remember something horrible from that civilization.

**This is exactly the same as when you gather with friends or siblings and talk about things that happened when you were a child. Suddenly everyone remembers something very different.**

**What you remember is not what happened. What you remember is YOUR EXPERIENCE of what happened.**

Before we try to remember past lives, what we have to do is exercise ourselves to understand how we are currently, in this moment, and how we relate with information in the here and now.

### What is Oblivion? What is the Goal of Forgetting?

Remember that oblivion is to get lost.

In the spiritual path, people usually say: "We have to be more in the present. We have to be present in ourselves. We have to live more here and now."

**This is why oblivion is what helps you to be in the present.**

To understand what oblivion is, remember that oblivion meant the darkness where you fall down in that cave.

To be in that darkness, not being able to see what is around you, not having any point of reference outside—**what is the only point of reference?**

**It's myself. Me. That's the only thing. It's myself, the only one I can use.**

**This is why oblivion is something that helps you to be yourself, to be here and now, to focus on the details of who you are here and now.**

### Oblivion Sets You Free

**The oblivion of the past and the oblivion of the future set yourself free.**

In which sense?

When you remember what you have been, when you remember what you are going to be, you are conditioned by all the things that you have done and all the things that you will do.

**You lose yourself in the possibility to see what you are NOW.**

In order to understand the whole, **you need to get to your core, what you call the essence.**

**And the essence can only be felt here and now, by us being.**

**This is why the universe needs for you to forget—because to forget is the only way in which you recognize the potential, the essence that you have here and now.**

### The Balance of Remembering and Forgetting

Both concepts are useful.

Sometimes people say to Matías: "It's very easy for you because you can do your mission because you remember everything."

But it's not like that. **Remembering for him is a tool.**

He has lost a lot of time in his life living more in the future and in the past than in the present. Because he was trying to do things to solve things from the past and to do things for the future, but **never putting energy in the present.**

**There are lots of people who have done much more in life by forgetting than by remembering.**

The process of remembering is not something that will help you accomplish your mission here and now. It's not something that will help you accomplish your purpose in life—**it's just a tool like any other.**

**To remember is not a key to living better.**

**To live better, the person must live in the present.**

Even if you remember, you have to live in the present besides remembering.

### The Greatest Gift

**The great gift and grace that we may have in our lives would be the ability to live in the present like a kid**—not thinking about the past, not thinking about the future, just living the present.

**But with the wisdom of an elder one** who knows what happened in the past and is open to what is going to happen in the future.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Stretch the body. Yawn. Cross your limbs.

Relax the body, focusing on your breathing.

### Becoming Wind

Start to perceive the air coming inside your body.

Feel how it moves inside you, making you feel like you are empty.

Only air and wind is spinning. Feel the air around your body connecting with the air within your body.

Feel yourself soft and light like a feather.

### The Soul's Energy

Perceive the energy of your body moving like wind within your body in a spiral of colors.

Expressing outside through the skin like a twister around you.

### Illuminating the Third Eye

Put your hands facing the sky at the height of your heart.

Perceive the light of the I Am, of the sun, coming towards you, going through the crown and anchoring in the third eye in the center of your brain with a beautiful indigo color.

Perceive the indigo light coming inside your body through your eyes like two rays of indigo color heading to your hands, filling up your hands with this beautiful light.

### Integration: Remembering in One Hand, Oblivion in the Other

**In one hand, perceive the concept of REMEMBERING.**

All your memories, all the data and information that you have within your brain is there, connected in the concept of remember.

**In your other hand, you have OBLIVION.**

The empty void of nothing, darkness, that makes you be here and now.

### Understanding Both

Become aware that **remembering is the tool that helps you understand the past and the future, connecting both of them with the present.**

Become aware that **oblivion is the one helping you to be fully here and now in the present.**

**This is how both of them unite within you to help you understand who you are here and now.**

### Unification

Take both hands to your heart, bringing your remembering and the oblivion both as one within your heart.

Unify them with the vibration of your being:

**SSpal... SSpal... SSpal... SSpal...**

**"I Am the Flux of Thoughts."**

All my memories, all my thoughts, are the different parts that create my memory.

**I am the memory and the oblivion.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and start to spread this consciousness, stretching, caressing, and yawning.

Come back here and now, opening your eyes.

### Important Note on Trauma

Remember that **a negative aspect of oblivion is when the brain is trying to defend ourselves from a trauma.**

This is a negative aspect of forgetting because it doesn't allow us to transcend—it just stores the information, locks it away.

This is where the good aspect of remembering comes in: **to give meaning, a logic to what happened.**

So having that in mind, let's integrate both.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Connecting Your Scattered Parts

Today's practice is to begin gathering the scattered parts of yourself:

**Choose one aspect of your life** (a relationship, a repeated pattern, an emotion that keeps arising, a challenge you face).

**Gather the data:**
- When did I first experience this? (smell, color, feeling)
- Where else have I experienced something similar? (connections)
- What information do I have about this scattered in different memories?

**Put the parts together:**
- What pattern emerges when I see these scattered experiences as connected?
- What logic appears when I join these separated parts?
- What memory is created when I connect these dots?

This is true remembering—not going to the past, but **connecting what you already have within.**

### Practicing Oblivion: Being Present

Counterbalance the remembering work with oblivion practice:

**Set aside time each day to be in the present without reference to past or future:**

- Sit in nature without thinking about what happened or what will happen
- Engage in an activity (walking, eating, creating) with full presence
- When past memories arise, acknowledge them and let them pass
- When future concerns arise, acknowledge them and let them pass
- Return to the only reference point: **I am here, now**

**This is healthy oblivion**—not forgetting who you are, but **forgetting the weight of past and future so you can BE in the present.**

### Recognizing Your Unique Gift

Stop trying to remember like Matías remembers. Stop trying to be spiritual like someone else is spiritual.

**What is YOUR gift?**

Maybe you don't remember past lives, but you:
- Deeply understand people's hearts
- Create beauty that touches souls
- Heal through presence
- See patterns others miss
- Feel the truth in situations
- Connect people and ideas

**Your gift is a part of yourself.** Stop wasting time imitating others. **Put your own scattered parts together.**

### Memory and Resonance

Understand that what you remember is determined by your current vibration:

If you're vibrating at fear, you'll remember fearful experiences.  
If you're vibrating at love, you'll remember loving experiences.  
If you're vibrating at possibility, you'll remember moments of potential.

**You're not remembering "the truth of the past"—you're remembering what resonates with your current frequency.**

This is why working on your present vibration changes what you "remember" about your past.

---

## Q&A

### Q: If remembering is just connecting parts I already have, why do I have memories I don't think I experienced?

**Because you have access to information beyond your individual experience.** Remember: there are no "other" lives, no separation. You are part of the universal memory. The water you drink was drunk by dinosaurs. The atoms in your body were in stars. You have access to the collective memory of existence—but you can only access what resonates with your current frequency.

### Q: How do I know if a memory is "real" or if I'm just connecting random data?

**All memories are "real" in the sense that they're data your consciousness has organized to create meaning.** The question isn't "Is this objectively true?" but "What meaning does this memory create for me? What understanding does it bring?" Even if the "facts" aren't historically accurate, the pattern, the teaching, the connection your consciousness created—that's real and useful.

### Q: Isn't forgetting dangerous? Don't we forget history and repeat mistakes?

**There's a difference between healthy oblivion (being present) and unconscious repression (hiding from trauma).** Healthy oblivion means not being conditioned by past and future when experiencing the present moment. It doesn't mean being ignorant of lessons learned. The wisdom of the elder includes knowing the past—but not LIVING in the past. Remember the teaching: "Live in the present like a kid, but with the wisdom of an elder."

### Q: I have traumatic memories I wish I could forget. Is that what you mean by oblivion?

**No. Trauma-based forgetting is the brain's defense mechanism, which locks away information rather than integrating it.** That's not the oblivion we're teaching. For trauma, you need the REMEMBERING process—gently connecting the scattered parts, giving meaning and logic to what happened, integrating the experience. Then, once integrated, you can practice healthy oblivion (being present without the trauma conditioning every moment).

### Q: If I'm constantly present (oblivion), how do I learn from past experiences?

**You're not choosing one over the other—you're balancing both.** At certain times, you gather the scattered parts (remembering) to create understanding and wisdom. At other times, you release past and future to BE fully present (oblivion). Both are necessary. The wisdom elder lives present but draws on integrated past experience when needed—not as conditioning, but as resource.

### Q: How can I improve my memory if it's just about connecting data I already have?

**By becoming more present to capture richer data, and by practicing making connections.** If you're distracted during experiences, you're not fully recording the smell, color, feeling—so there's less data to connect later. Be more present during experiences. Then practice seeing patterns, making connections between seemingly separate experiences. This strengthens your remembering capacity.

### Q: You said we're all stardust, all one memory. Does that mean there's no individual "me"?

**The individual "you" is a unique perspective, a unique organization of the universal data.** Think of it like this: the ocean is one, but each wave has a unique shape, movement, expression. You are a unique wave in the ocean of universal memory—individual expression of collective existence. Both are true: you're unique AND you're inseparable from the whole.

### Q: What's the practical benefit of understanding remembering this way?

**Freedom from the tyranny of "the past."** When you understand that what you remember is your current organization of data (influenced by your current vibration), you realize you can reorganize it. You're not a prisoner of past events—you're the consciousness that creates meaning from data. Change your vibration, change what you remember. Change what you remember, change your present. This is profound liberation.

## Closing Reflection

Today we've explored **Remember and Oblivion**—two concepts that seem opposed but are actually complementary tools for consciousness.

**Remembering is not what we thought it was.** It's not going to the past to retrieve fixed truths. It's the sacred act of connecting the scattered parts within us, creating meaning and logic from the data we carry.

**Oblivion is not what we feared it was.** It's not ignorance or weakness. It's the sacred act of releasing past and future to BE fully present, to touch our essence in the here and now.

Both are necessary:

**Without remembering**, we cannot create wisdom, cannot see patterns, cannot integrate experience into understanding.

**Without oblivion**, we cannot be present, cannot access our essence, cannot experience the freedom of NOW unencumbered by the weight of past and future.

The great gift is to **live in the present like a child** (oblivion—free, open, experiencing fully) **but with the wisdom of an elder** (remembering—integrated understanding, recognized patterns, learned lessons).

**You are not trying to remember past lives to prove you're special or to explain your present.** You're learning to connect the scattered parts of yourself, to see the logic and meaning in your own data, to create understanding from your own experience.

**You are not trying to forget everything to escape or to be ignorant.** You're learning to release the conditioning of past and future so you can BE, so you can touch your essence, so you can experience the eternal now.

**"I Am the Flux of Thoughts"**—the eternal flow of connecting and releasing, remembering and forgetting, creating meaning and dwelling in presence.

Both are sacred. Both are necessary. Both are you.

See you tomorrow for Day 73, as we continue the Emotional Week.

Rest well. Drink water. Notice which parts of yourself are asking to be connected.
