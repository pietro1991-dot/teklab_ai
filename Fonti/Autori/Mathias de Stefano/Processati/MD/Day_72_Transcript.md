## Introduction

Hi everyone. How are you? All good?

So for those who are reading and following everything every day , so I did imposed the in the blog today until 20 minutes ago , because they just wrote it.

So today I had a very liberate day. I have a very old day , no inspiration , and like just nothing.

So it was very hard.

So today was one of those days that I could n't do anything that I had no will for anything.

So I was just sitting there and reading the whole day. Weird day.

So the feeling that I had today , I guess , is like I 've been realizing today that I have been doing exactly the same every day , and every day I do the same. And I see the same people , the same plays. Even if I feel fine because I 'm feeling fine , I have everything that I need. I am very like weird.

It 's not my nature.

So basically I 'm not feeling bad.

So I 'm fine. But it 's very weird because I usually want to do stuff , but it 's not even that what I want is like I do n't want to do different things. Like if I have the opportunity to go and do something , I would say no , I would rather stay here and read , which is something that I never would do it.

So just to say that if you feel me weird explaining things today , it 's just that I am having a very weird week.

So let 's begin with today 's topic. Is Surya de Nozartnada? This is tireless of not doing anything. Anyway , we do n't have any secrets.

So today is the topic we 're going to discuss today is. . . That 's a problem to begin with like this , because the topic for today is remember , and forget oblivion , better said.

Remember and oblivion.

Today I 've been trying also to try to think about what is happening to me , to say maybe some planet , and yes , today we started with. . . I mean , we started with.

. . Mercury , and we are also in Mars retrograde.

So of course this is very heavy weeks that we expect to in terms of communication. But even if I was trying to. . .

If I was trying to look for astrological explanation , I guess this is because since July 25th , I 've been doing the same , I 've been doing these videos , I 've been doing exactly the same , going to the pyramid every day. And of course , I 'm tired. Kind of like that. I 'm going to use to the day by day.

So even with all weekends , so I do n't even know which days today.

So it 's. . . Who!

I 'm sorry , but it 's what we have. The topic for today is to remember and to forget the oblivion.

So let 's try to think about this.

Remember that we are in the Libre month , so we are trying to balance topics that are usually opposite to each other , but we are trying to put them together as one.

So for sure to remember and to forget , there are two very deep things that we usually set as opposites to each other.

So let 's go to the origin of the words , so we could know what is the origin of the concepts we are talking about.

So first of all , let 's go to the word remember.

Remember comes from the Latin word re and remember. Re is to go back to , to do it again , and remember is parts. The members of the body , the members of our congregation , the members of something.

So this means basically to join all the parts that are separated , all the different concepts that were divided through the experience , through the life , that through history , we have been dividing as different memories. All these memories , when you try to remember , must be put them all together , we should put them all together in order to. . .

To can see them , to make a logic of all of them.

So that 's what remembering means to unite all these different parts , to make a logic of them. In Spanish language , we used to call this like a record this , that means to come back to the heart.

So come back to the heart , is because they thought that the center where everything could be joined is the center of a person which is the heart.

So in the other hand , to forget , and we are going to use the word oblivion , which comes from the Latin words. Oblivion means comes from the word from the Indo-European word that is slippery , means slippery.

So something like the math on the rock , when it 's in a cave , where everything is dark , and there is a lot of humidity , and a person can fell down because of the slippery rocks.

So kind of you fall into the darkness of the cave.

So this is basically what oblivion means to fall down , to lose the balance.

Something like that. What oblivion would mean is for the ancient ones is to lose the balance , to lose the balance of where I am and fall into the darkness because I can not have a point of reference.

So basically to make a summary of this , if remembering would be to see the different parts and put them together in my axis , so to forget would be to lose the axis and do n't be able to see the different parts.

So basically our society is based on the will of remembering , because for us to remember is something that is important because it 's something that we need to understand history , not to forget what happened. And to have memories important , so this is why we always remember , we always hear this sentence like remember , you have to remember , it 's important to remember. And to forget , oblivion is something but it 's something that it 's ignorance.

So for example , I am kind of a remembered and most of you maybe are following everything that I do because I remember everything that I 've done before I was born. I can remember my past lives , everything what I did. But this is my gift and a lot of people used to say , how can I do to remember to like you do? And it 's very difficult to say exactly how because it 's not that I did a process to remember it was something that I was born with.

And to understand this is like if you take a person that has the gift of music , there are some people that just born with the ability of the music. And there 's other people that they are willing to become musicians.

So with much time and a lot of practice and study , that people that those persons can become also musicians can complain instruments. But for the person that was born with that is difficult to explain how because they did n't study they just know music. And this happens to all of us in different aspects.

So when when some people used to tell me , how can I do to remember to remember as you do , I would say no , first try to figure what is your own gift because maybe you are , you are losing time. And trying to imitate the others because you think that is good , but the best way is to awake your own because you have it there constantly with yourself and trying to imitate others , you just lose a lot of time. And here we come about the concept of remembering because when you realize this , you will know that your gift is a part of yourself.

So all you have to do is start to put the different parts of yourself together. When you start all the different parts that you never pay attention to and you put them together , you start to give them a meaning. A sense , you understand the logic of all that and that process is remembering remembering is precisely that to give a logic to all the parts that I have within that are disorder or separated. Separated from each other.

So you put them together and you remember.

So this is why to remember is not about to remember history is not about to know what happened in other lives or in the cosmos to remember is to be able to connect all the different parts that I have for myself. And to put or to connect them again so I can see the logic of all of that.

Sometimes I do n't remember because I just go to the past. I remember because I am able to connect the dots of the things that are separated.

So I understand the logic and suddenly the everything opens and you can understand the memory of it. To understand how this works , we have to understand how the brain works. The brain is like a computer. It 's a computer that registry data constantly all the time.

So it 's writing information all the time. But the brain has many folders where or boxes where it puts all the information.

So you have a box or a folder of smells another one of colors , another one of feelings. And the brain takes one smell , one color and one feeling and put them together. It creates a memory which comes from information which which is the word memo.

Okay. That 's memory. It 's a data. It 's an information all together.

So remember what would be remember would be to take the information from the smell , the color and the feeling and put them together creating a memory. And that memory , this process of putting together a memory , we call remember. The process of creating a memory , we call it remember. But we have to understand this.

That remember is not something that your brain does going to the past to look for information. What your brain does is to take the information of the data that you have taken from those experiences. Put them together. I hope you got this because it 's very important.

Remember is not the past to bring memories.

Remember is to put data that you already have within to understand the data that you have from an experience that you had.

Okay. The memory , the remembering is not something that you go to look in the past.

Remembering is the concept , the action of looking for information that you already have within already organized in your brain. And it put it together to the memory so you can understand what happened.

## Q&A

So this is why to remember is to give logic to something that happened. But not only what happened , also all the things and data that maybe has a relation with that that I am trying to solve. The questions would come now that so how is possible that I can remember other lives or other beings or whatever. Well , we have to remember everything that we have spoken in previous videos that there is not such a thing as other because the universe is a constant is everything one.

So there is not other lives. It 's only one life being expressed in different shapes.

So this helps us to understand that whatever we remember is information data that is not only ours , that is from the whole world. Because even the word that you have drinking , that you drink every day was also drunk by a dinosaur someday.

So that 's why we can remember everything. Basically , we are not separated beings. We are a constant of the universe.

So when I say something that I remember is information from the whole universe is from everything. The information is in the atoms in the energy of atoms. And my atoms are the same atoms that are also in the stars. We are star dust.

So from the very beginning , we are the memory of the universe. And we are memory , we are memory because we are data of the universe information.

So this is why we can remember whatever. Because within ourselves , we have the information of whatever. The only way I can remember an information is if I am in the same frequency and vibration of that information.

The reason why we can only perceive one information is because we have to be in the same vibration as the other information in order to be seen to be a remember. This works like if you have to build things very close , want each other. And you have many windows , many layers.

So you will be able to see the layer in front of you of the other building because you are very close to it.

So if you change your ground , you will see a different information and a different perspective.

So this is what happened with the universe. According to in which level you are in which information you are aligned to , you will have a perception and information specifically to your level. Let 's say it again to remember is to put the different parts together. I will only be able to put the parts together , those parts together , those that I can see , that I can rest rebound.

So this is why I will be able to remember only those that I can see.

So this explains why you will be able to remember according to the resonance , the vibration that you have. We used to remember a sample. We used to remember according to the perceptions that our tree of life has experience.

So first of all , if I , if my tree of life has has experience , the good part of Atlantis when everything was great.

So I will remember I have very good Atlantis. But some other person that will , that maybe had lived the flood and the end of Atlantis , we have passed the information through the cells to us now that they lived the horrible part of Atlantis.

So that other person will remember something horrible from that civilization. And me , I will be remember something good from us. And this is exactly the same as when you gather with friends or with brother siblings , whoever , and you talk about things that happen when you were a child. And suddenly everyone remembers something very different from , from the rest.

And this is because what you remember is not what happened. What you remember is your experience of what happened. To remember is to put together data that I have within me. Before we start to try to remember past lives , what we have to do is to try to exercise ourselves to understand how we are , diversionally in this moment and how we relate with information in this here and this now.

So now we have to answer the idea of what is to forget , what is oblivion , what is the goal of this process of forgetting things.

So remember that oblivion is to get lost. Have you seen that in the spiritual path , people usually say we have to be more in the present. We have to be present in ourselves. We have to live more here and now.

So this is why oblivion is what helps you to be in the present.

So to understand what is oblivion , remember that oblivion meant the darkness where you fall down in that cave.

So yet , to be in that darkness , not being able to see what is around you , not having any point of reference.

So if there is no point of reference outside , what is the only point of reference? It 's myself. Me , that 's the only thing. It 's myself , the only one I can use.

So this is why oblivion is something that helps you to be yourself , to be here and now , to focus in the details of who are here and now.

So basically , the concept would be this , that the oblivion of the past and the oblivion of the future , set yourself free. In which sense that when you remember what you have been , when you remember what you are going to be , your condition , by all the things that you have done and all the things that you will do.

So you lose yourself in the possibility to see what you are now. And in order to understand the whole , you need to get with your stuff , what you call the essence. And the essence can only be felt here and now , by us being.

So this is why the universe needs for you to forget , because to forget is the only way in which you recognize the potential , the essence that you have here and now.

Okay.

So both concepts are useful.

Sometimes there are , there are people saying to me , it 's very easy for you because you can do your mission because you , because you remember everything. But it 's not like that because remembering for me is a tool. And I have lost a lot of time in my life because it was living more in the future and in the past than in the present. Because I was just trying to do things to solve things from the past and to do things for the future , but never putting energy in the present.

There are lots of people that have done much more in life by forgetting than remembering. The process of remembering is not something that will help you accomplish your mission here and now. It 's not something that will help you to accomplish your purpose in life is just a tool as any other. That 's it.

So to remember is not a key to live to live better. To remember in order to live better , the person must live in the present.

So you will do that even if you remember , but besides remembering , you have to live in the present.

So the great gift and grace that we may have in our lives would be the ability to live in the present like a kid. Not thinking about the past , not thinking about the future , just living the present. But with the wisdom of an elder one that knows what happened in the past and it 's open to what is going to happen in the future.

## Daily Practice Elements

Okay , so let 's go to the information for today. There I , the vibration for today is five. The statement for today is , I am the flux of thinking of thoughts.

## Energy Work

So the code for today is the physical pattern , Paul , which is the last letter in the Atlantic alphabet. And it says , for that , the sites to go to the deepest part of the world , letting go the idea of going to the stars and certain for the nucleus of the world through its roots , going through darkness , knowing that it does n't exist anymore , going to the roots , pillars of the past , knowing that they are the foundations of its existence and acknowledges that in the , that in a sphere , they only come and point among its 360 degrees , it 's not on the top , but in the center.

So , other thing that I want to say before we start according to the last letter that we have read now and all explanations that we are doing in Libre is that for sure for people that is new and that it 's looking not by doing the process , but from the outside. You may be , or they can , they can perceive that maybe I am bringing you to the darkness and trying to , to push you towards the , I do n't know , like , to be lost in the universe or whatever. I am explaining this because I know that there 's a lot of people that maybe believe that that I am using this energy and controlling everyone and trying to take energy from you.

## Q&A

So , I just want to say this because I know there 's a lot of people that maybe would ask to you , what is , why are you doing this? I 've heard that he is trying to do this control of energy or whatever. And the reason why I speak so well about the darkness and the light as common as both the same is because , because one of the main keys that I always have heard from humanity is that is the will of change. That we want to change to do something different to do something new transcendental and it 's weird that people is trying to do something different with the same tools.

Same that there is a bad guy and a good guy and always like that , always the same.

So , you are not going to change the world in a different perspective if you do n't transcend the tools that you have used for thousands of years.

So , we need to change that. I am one thinking that I rather change my tools , my perceptions , then keep following this absurd fight between light and darkness and so on.

So , I guess we can do better than that. We have done that always and never worked.

So , this is why I do this in this way. And if people is willing to make me the bad guy of the movie , I will love that because being the good one in the movie is so boring. Without the bad guy , there is no movie.

So , I am glad.

So , another thing is that I have been reading people that said please sing or channel something. But I ca n't control channeling. I just , it just happened. It can happen tomorrow.

It can happen five months. In five months. I do n't know. I do n't control that.

So , channeling is something that just happened.

So , it happens.

Today I am very alone and there is no one here , no one in other level of consciousness , no one I am alone here.

So , sorry but you will have to hear me. No one else.

So , we begin stretching the body , warning , crossing. And I relax the body , focusing in my breathing. I start to perceive the air coming inside my body. I feel how moves inside me.

Making me feel like if I am empty. Only air and wind is spinning. I feel the air around my body. To connect with the air within my body.

I feel myself soft and light like a feather. I perceive the energy of my body to move like wind within my body. In a spiral of colors. Expressing outside through the skin like a twitter around me.

## Energy Work

I put my hands facing the sky at the height of my heart. I perceive the light of the eye of the sun coming towards me. Going through the crown and on-cream in the third eye in the center of my brain with a beautiful indigo color. I perceive the indigo light coming inside of my body through my eyes like two rays of indigo color heading to my hands.

Feeling up my hands with this beautiful light. I perceive in one hand the concept of remembering.

So all my memories , all the data information that I have within my brain is there connected in the concept of remember. And my other hand I have the oblivion. The empty void of nothing darkness that makes me be here and now. I become aware that remembering is the concept , the tool that helps me understand the past and the future.

Connecting both of them with the present. And so I become aware that the oblivion is the one helping me to be fully here and now in the present. This is how I become aware that both of them get united within me to helping me to understand that I who I am here and now. I take both hands to my heart , bringing my remembering and the oblivion both as one within my heart.

And I unify them with the vibration of my being.

So all my memories , all my memories , all my memories , all my memories. I am the flux of thoughts. And all my thoughts are the different parts that create my memory. I am the memory and the oblivion.

I take the breath and start to spread this consciousness , stretching , crossing and winning. And I come back here and now , opening my eyes. And remember that a negative part of the oblivion is when the brain is trying to defend ourselves from a trauma.

So this is a negative aspect of oblivion of forgetting because it does n't allow us to transcend. It just starts , it just starts information.

So this is the good aspect of remembering which is to give a meaning , a logic to what happened. And what happened?

So having that in mind , let 's go to make the drawing of what oblivion and memory means for us.

So thank you for being there and as always , see you tomorrow at the same time. Bye-bye.
