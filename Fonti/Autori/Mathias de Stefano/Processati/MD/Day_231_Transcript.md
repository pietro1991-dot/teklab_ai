## Overview

Today we begin the Physical Week of Pisces, working with the Crown Chakra. Our topic is psychology—the study of the soul and its movement through life.

Psychology is a relatively young field, less than 150 years old, yet it addresses one of humanity's oldest questions: what is the soul, and how does it move us through our existence?

---

## The Etymology of Psychology

### Psyche: The Animated Soul

Psychology comes from the word "psyche," which means soul. Psyche is the concept of the thoughts that move you through life. In Latin, the equivalent is "anima," meaning animation—the animated things, the things that are in movement.

Psychology is everything related to the movement of the soul. For the ancient ones, the idea was that soul was the movement that pushed us to action, the things we had within that made us move through our life.

### Two Cultural Views of the Soul

For some cultures, the soul is the part of the being that is living within, helping the body to have life and move. The idea of this culture was that the body was like a prison for the soul. What we needed to do was set ourselves free from the body, from this oppression of reality that we suffer. The soul needed to be released from this prison.

For some cultures and religions, the soul is part of the being that is trapped in the body and needs to be released to be free from the oppression of reality.

But from some other cultures, the soul is not something trapped within—it is the essence, the main energy, the movement that makes our body alive. It doesn't need to be released; it needs to be expanded according to these other traditions.

## Religion vs Philosophy: Two Approaches to the Soul

### The Religious View

From the point of view of religion, the story of the soul is that we were souls in heaven, and then we were sent to life because of our sins or our mistakes. During our lives we need to make ourselves possible to make our soul much more lighter so we can set ourselves free.

But for other religions, the soul is something that must be fulfilled with wisdom by doing questions, by wondering about the truth.

Through thousands of years, the soul was taken as a spiritual concept—something from other levels of reality, from other perceptions, from other dimensions. It's something divine living in this matter, in this reality.

### The Philosophical View

But from another point of view—the philosophy point of view—the soul was not something divine; it was something human. They started to work with the idea of the soul that is human. Philosophy didn't see the soul as something spiritual related to religion.

For religions, the soul was something that needed to be released, but for philosophy it was something that needed to be fed by knowledge.

### Philosophy Means Love of Wisdom

According to this, philosophy is kind of against religion because philosophy means the love for wisdom. The way you achieve wisdom is by questioning, by doing questions to yourself all the time, questioning the world—which is exactly the opposite idea of religion.

Religion is guided by dogma, which are kind of enormous tips that say what to do and when to do it. It's better to follow. And philosophy basically is against that. It says that we need to question everything.

### The Problem with Philosophy

Philosophy has a problem for ancient times and also today: it questions so much that you never find answers. And one of the main keys of cultures, religions, and society is to find stability in people so they can live secure and safe.

Because of this, philosophy was not the best system to follow if you want social order.

---

## Why Religion Dominated Society

### The Need for Structure

This is why even though the caesars and the emperors used to ask for advice from philosophers to see a different perspective, for the bigger population, religions were the best system. In that time, we needed structure because they didn't have many tools like we have today. They needed to be guided to have order in society. They needed religion in a way to keep the people safe and secure.

Remember that when we understand this, we should not judge history. It was the best tool they got in that moment because they didn't have all the tools like we have today.

Through all the centuries, it was better for systems and society to find order through religion because religion helped politics and economics work better and much more ordered in that time.

### The Creation of Norms

That's why they created the laws of the system that in Latin you know as "norm." The norm is the name for the law of the Roman society, and that's the origin of the word normality—something that is normal. It means that it depends on the law, on the established law for an empire, for a government.

This is how religion was kind of this censor that could tell the system what is under the normative and what is not under the normative.

---

## Outside the Normative: The Crazy Ones

### Being Out of Place

Basically, the structure of society through religion created this idea that everything outside the normative is someone who is outside of place. That is someone who is not in the right place, which in Latin you may say "locus," which means place.

The word "location" for example is the origin of that word. In the romance languages we have this expression that is "loco," that means to be outside the location. When you are out of the normative of the system, you are outside—so that's "loco."

### The Etymology of Crazy

"Loco" in English is "crazy," and crazy is the adjective of being cracked—something that is broken.

When you break the law that is established by the government, you are broken. And if you break the law, you are cracking, and this cracked person is a crazy person.

So the crazy person is the one that is cracking the system. Basically, throughout history, the people that were considered crazy were the ones that broke the idea of the system, that were thinking in a different way.

### Crazy People Were Geniuses

The crazy people used to be geniuses usually, but the system said, "You are doing something different, so you are not good."

The crazy people are the ones that start to question the systems. When they question the system, they start to nourish the soul, to nourish the inner aspects of themselves.

---

## The Renaissance: Awakening the Soul

### The Conflict with Science

Besides all these crazy people that were asking questions and saying, "How can we understand the reality of the world, the soul of the being? We need to look for more questions within ourselves, but we need to understand how the body works."

To make science, to question, the religion said, "We don't allow you to open bodies. We don't allow you to investigate how the human body works because the soul must be protected."

They considered it a sin to make an autopsy in the past. You could not open the body to see the soul—you needed to protect that unity within. This represented a great delay in the understanding of the human being.

### The Return of Greek Ideas

Remember that in the Renaissance, people started to question again because they brought all the ideas from the Greeks. They took back the idea of the psyche. They started to awaken the soul again with the arts, with the body, trying to understand the beauty of nature, questioning nature. That's why they created science as a way of understanding.

### The Birth of "Logos" Studies

From that moment, they created the study of things. The study of things in Greek you may say "logos"—so everything that ends in "-logy" represents the study of something.

One of the studies that came out in the 1880s was the study of the soul, and this concept was brought because they were trying to understand where was the soul. Trying to find the soul, now that you can open bodies and you have permission to do autopsies.

---

## The Birth of Psychology in the 1880s

### The Soul in the Brain

Nobody found the soul within the body. If the soul was the movement, the will of the body, what was moving the body? The nervous system. And the nervous system was related to the brain.

So the soul must be in the brain that is moving the entire body. But you cannot investigate a brain that is dead. You need to investigate how it works when you are alive.

This is why they created the study by experimentation and questions to look for the patterns of how the brain works so you can understand the soul. This is how in 1880 in Germany they started to find the study of the soul that we call psychology.

### Psychology Studies Attitudes

Basically, psychology is the study of the attitudes of humanity, of humans.

Now psychology doesn't have more than 150 years. In comparison to religions and systems that have thousands of years, all this history lets us know that basically we were designed to find stability through systems. We are used to having systems that tell us what to do, not to question the systems—otherwise we lose stability, we can feel unsafe.

## The Modern Fear of Psychology

### Questioning Ourselves

Because of this construction that we have in our psychology, in our mind, most people have a preconception of psychology that they don't want to know anything about it. Because psychology makes you question yourself. It makes you find the cracks in your mind and makes you find the answers that will change your life.

Psychology basically helps you to question yourself, the tools that you have, and helps you to transcend yourself, to transform into another thing—which is basically the fear that everyone has in their lives.

### The Misconception

Basically, today people used to think that psychology is like the medicine for the head, for the crazy ones. But it's not a doctor, it's not a physician like, for example, a psychiatrist. It's a helpful way to understand the things that you don't know how to order within yourself.

Usually we say that to go to psychology is to be crazy. You have to be crazy because of that.

### Why We Wait Until We Crack

Basically what happens is that through our lives, we usually try to protect ourselves from others. We hold and hold all the trauma within until we cannot hold them anymore. So we crack.

When we crack and we lose our center, we become crazy. That's why we usually relate going to psychiatry or psychology in the moment when we crack—because we have been holding it a long time.

Culturally, socially, we have been prepared not to share our weakness. We have been prepared to protect ourselves and not to show the weak parts of ourselves and not to share our feelings.

This is why we relate psychology with something that is an illness from the head.

---

## What Psychology Really Is

### Accompanying Through Life

Psychology is not about helping someone that got crazy. It's about accompanying people during the whole life to handle and to know the tools and the things that they have within and how to handle them.

Of course, if we had this company of psychology throughout our entire life, we would be able to share what we feel, the emotions we have within, to understand how to listen to others, and we would be able to expand our soul.

Throughout our life, we would be much more ready, much more permeable to receive information, to expand the soul as the ancients used to say.

## Daily Task

Two things I will say as a task for the Physical Week of Pisces, but for your entire life:

1. Question everything that you have within
2. Go to a psychologist

---

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Acknowledge the constant thoughts in your breathing. Take a deep breath and start to caress, massage each part of your body from your feet towards the head. Softly, smoothly.

Become aware of each part that you touch. Become aware of your feet, your legs, your genitals, hips, waist, back, chest, arms, hands, shoulders, neck, face, and head.

### Massaging the Ears

Softly, start to massage your ears, touching each corner of it, inside and outside. Softly, start to massage your ears. Start to go up to the side of the head. Start to massage your ears.

Softly, caress from the back, stretching all the tension until your feet.

### Feeling the Brain

Feel the heat in your ears and how it goes within the center of your brain. You can feel the two parts of it, the right and left hemispheres.

Take a deep breath and perceive an explosion of colors from the center of your brain towards each part of it.

### Finding the Pearl

Perceive the memories, the thoughts, the emotions, all the records that make you be what you are here. Find a beautiful pearl that radiates all these colors.

Remember that this gland is the one that makes you be who you are, that makes you feel emotions, that creates your thoughts, and that pushes your actions.

### The Essence of Being

I am here to see what I can find—the essence, the whole, all the knowledge of my being, of the learning of my soul.

I am here to see what I can find. I am here to see what I can find. I am here to see what I can find.

### Sound the Vibration

Ta. I am the manifested spirit. I am the manifested spirit.

I am here to see what I can find. I am here to see what I can find.

## Integration

### Questioning Everything

Today, begin the practice of questioning your inner world. What beliefs do you hold that you've never examined? What patterns do you repeat without understanding why?

Psychology is the tool for this inner exploration.

### Seeking Support

Consider seeking psychological support—not because you're broken, but because you want to expand your soul, understand yourself better, and have a companion in your journey of self-discovery.

There is no shame in this. It is wisdom.

## Q&A

### Q: Is psychology against spirituality?

No. Psychology is the study of the soul's movement. It complements spirituality by helping us understand how the soul works through the mind, emotions, and body. True spirituality includes understanding yourself.

### Q: Why do people think going to a psychologist means you're crazy?

Because historically, we've been conditioned to hide our weakness and only seek help when we "crack." But psychology is not for the crazy—it's for anyone who wants to understand themselves and expand their consciousness.

### Q: Didn't religion help society function?

Yes. We should not judge history. Religion provided the structure and stability that society needed when we didn't have the tools we have today. It was the best system for that time.

### Q: What's the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist?

A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who treats mental illness, often with medication. A psychologist helps you understand your patterns, emotions, and thoughts—accompanying you in your process of self-discovery and transformation.

### Q: If philosophy questions everything, how do we ever find answers?

Philosophy finds answers through the process of questioning itself. The journey is the answer. Each question leads to deeper understanding, even if it doesn't lead to absolute certainty.

### Q: Why were "crazy people" actually geniuses?

Because they thought outside the normative, questioned the system, and saw reality differently. What the system called "crazy" was often visionary thinking that eventually transformed society.

### Q: How does psychology help us expand the soul?

By making us aware of our patterns, traumas, beliefs, and emotions, psychology helps us integrate our experiences. This integration allows the soul to expand, to receive more information, to become more permeable to wisdom.
