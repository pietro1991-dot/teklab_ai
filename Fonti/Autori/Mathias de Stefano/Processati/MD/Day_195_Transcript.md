## Overview

Day 195. The baby is about to be born—but not yet. False alarms. Interrupted sleep. Matias is tired, living with others, his energy shifting, his axis adjusting. He apologizes for what happened yesterday (the channeled being speaking through him), clarifying:

**"I don't judge whether they come or not. I perceive that if they are here, it's because one part of me is expressing that. They are not different beings—they are myself, expanded around."**

This is the essence of today's teaching on **Cancer**—the understanding that **what we perceive as "other" is actually part of us, nourishing us, connected to us, like a mother and child**.

We connect with the **plexus chakra** (solar plexus)—the center of personal power, identity, the sense of "I am."

And our topic is **Cancer**—the constellation of the **crab, the shell, the protector, the nourisher**.

Cancer is the **soul** (emotional aspect) of the **Trinity of Water**. Yesterday we learned Pisces (spirit/ocean). Today, Cancer (soul/rivers). Tomorrow we'll complete with Scorpio (body/depths).

Cancer teaches: **Attachment is not the enemy. It's a tool. The question is: What are you attached to, and is it nourishing you or draining you?**

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology of Cancer: The Hard Shell

The word **Cancer** comes from the Proto-Indo-European root **"Kar"**, which means **"something that is hard, like a shell, that protects something soft in the center."**

This same root gives us the word **"carapace"**—the hard outer shell of a turtle or crab.

The **crab** is the animal that perfectly embodies this: a hard, protective shell on the outside, and a soft, vulnerable body on the inside.

This is the essence of Cancer: **Protection around vulnerability. Hardness around softness. The shell around the heart.**

### Cancer the Disease vs. Cancer the Constellation

Matias clarifies an important linguistic point: **Cancer the disease is NOT named after the constellation because of some mystical curse.**

It's named Cancer because ancient Greek physicians observed that **the disease created a structure of dead cells surrounding an organ—like a hard shell covering something soft**.

Linguistically, they used the same word—**"karkinos"** (crab/shell)—to describe both the animal and the disease, because **the visual structure was similar**.

So it's not about the constellation or the zodiac sign being "bad." It's simply **linguistics**—the same word used to describe similar forms.

Once we separate the disease from the constellation, we can move forward into the true teaching.

### Why the Constellation Is Called Cancer

All the explanations Matias gives about constellations relate to the **northern hemisphere**, because northern astrology and astronomy became globalized and are now known worldwide.

(In the southern hemisphere, the same constellation might be called "the llama" or "the ñandú" or something else entirely—but everyone knows "Cancer" because of cultural globalization.)

The constellation **Cancer** was born in the **Mediterranean region** (between Europe and Africa) and the **Mesopotamia region** (between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers).

**Mediterranean** means "in the middle of lands" (Africa to the south, Europe to the north).

**Mesopotamia** means "in the middle of rivers" (Euphrates and Tigris).

And in Africa, we have the **Nile** with its two main tributaries: the **White Nile** and the **Blue Nile**.

This region—where three great river systems meet—is where the concept of Cancer was born.

### Cancer and the Rivers: The Soul of Water

In the Trinity of Water:

- **Pisces** = the **ocean** (wide, open, holding everything—the spirit)
- **Cancer** = the **rivers** (flows that create links between bodies of water—the soul)
- **Scorpio** = the **locked wells** (deep, internal, contained—the body)

Cancer represents the **soul** because it's the **connection, the flow, the relational energy** that links different parts.

Rivers **nourish**. They bring water from the mountains to the valleys, from the source to the sea. They carry life. They connect.

This is why Cancer is associated with **nourishment, family, care, protection**—because the rivers were what kept ancient civilizations alive. The Nile, the Euphrates, the Tigris—these rivers were the **mothers** of civilization.

### Cancer and the Summer Solstice

The constellation Cancer appears in the sky around the **summer solstice** (late June), which is the **longest day of the year** in the northern hemisphere.

This is the moment when the Sun is at its highest point, directly above the **Tropic of Cancer**—the northern boundary of the tropics.

(The Tropic of Cancer is literally named after the constellation that the Sun appears to "touch" at the solstice.)

At this moment, the day is longest, the Sun is strongest, and the light is at its peak. But it's also the **turning point**—after this, the days begin to shorten again, moving toward darkness.

Cancer, therefore, represents the **peak of light**—but also the awareness that **nothing stays at the peak forever**. Everything cycles. And we must **prepare, protect, store, nourish** for the times of darkness.

### The Crab: Protection and Vulnerability

The crab has a hard shell to protect its soft interior. It can retreat into its shell when threatened. But it cannot **live** inside the shell—it must come out to eat, to move, to interact.

This is the teaching of Cancer: **Protection is necessary. Boundaries are healthy. But if you hide in your shell forever, you cannot nourish yourself.**

Cancer teaches the balance between:
- **Openness and protection**
- **Vulnerability and boundaries**
- **Attachment and freedom**

You need the shell. But you also need to **leave the shell** when it's time to receive nourishment.

### Attachment as a Tool for Evolution

One of the most misunderstood teachings in spirituality is about **attachment**.

Many teachings say: "Detach. Let go. Attachment is suffering."

But Matias offers a different perspective: **Attachment is not the enemy. Attachment is a tool.**

Cancer teaches: **What you are attached to determines whether that attachment nourishes you or drains you.**

A baby is attached to the mother. This attachment is **nourishing**—it keeps the baby alive, safe, loved. Without this attachment, the baby would die.

A person is attached to a memory of the past, replaying trauma over and over. This attachment is **draining**—it keeps the person stuck, unable to move forward.

**Attachment itself is neutral. The question is: What are you attached to, and why?**

If you're attached to something that **nourishes, protects, and supports your growth**, that attachment is **healthy**.

If you're attached to something that **drains, controls, and keeps you stuck**, that attachment is **unhealthy**.

Matias says: **"I realize that everything I am attached to are just tools for my own evolution."**

Attachment is not a prison. **It's a river.** It flows. It connects. It brings nourishment—if you choose what to attach to consciously.

### Tears as Nourishment

At the end of the teaching, Matias does a beautiful practice (which he may have been guided to do):

**"I take with my hands the information of Cancer and bring it in front of me, and I bring it as nourishment of tears from my body."**

Tears are **water**. They are the **emotional release** of what we've been holding.

Cancer, as the soul of water, teaches that **tears are not weakness—they are nourishment**. They cleanse. They flow. They connect us to what we feel.

When you cry, you are **releasing** what you've been holding in your shell. You are **letting the river flow**.

## Practice

### Finding Your Shell and Your River

Today's practice is about **recognizing what protects you, what nourishes you, and what you're attached to**.

**Step 1: Feel Your Shell**  
Place both hands on your **solar plexus** (just below your ribcage, above your navel). This is the plexus chakra—your center, your "I am," your personal power.

Close your eyes. Ask: "What is my shell? What do I use to protect myself?"

It might be:
- Physical boundaries (walls, distance, solitude)
- Emotional armor (sarcasm, coldness, control)
- Mental defenses (analysis, rationalization, detachment)

Don't judge it. Just notice it. **You need your shell. It keeps you safe.**

**Step 2: Feel Your Soft Center**  
Now, beneath that shell, feel the **soft, vulnerable part** of you—the part that feels, that loves, that hopes, that fears.

This is the part the shell is protecting.

Say: "I honor my vulnerability. I honor my softness. This is my humanity."

**Step 3: Ask About Your Attachments**  
Ask: "What am I attached to right now?"

It might be:
- People (family, friends, partners)
- Memories (past experiences, traumas, joys)
- Beliefs (about yourself, the world, what's possible)
- Things (possessions, roles, identities)

For each attachment, ask: **"Is this nourishing me, or draining me?"**

If it nourishes (supports growth, brings love, creates flow)—honor it. Keep it.  
If it drains (keeps you stuck, controls you, blocks flow)—recognize it. Consider releasing it.

**Step 4: Sound the Vibration**  
With your hands still on your plexus, sound the vibration **"Sï"** three times, feeling it resonate in your center.

This is the frequency of **personal power, identity, the centre of self**.

**Step 5: Speak the Statement**  
Say aloud: **"I Am the Path to the Centre."**

You are the one who knows your center. You are the one who chooses what enters your shell and what you attach to. You are sovereign.

**Step 6: Let the River Flow (Optional Tears)**  
If you feel emotion rising—sadness, grief, relief, joy—**let it flow**.

Place your hands in front of your heart, palms up, as if receiving. Let tears come if they come. Let sound come if it comes.

Say: "These tears are my river. They nourish me. They connect me to what I feel."

**Tears are not weakness. They are the soul of water, flowing.**

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**The Nourishment Audit:**  
Make a list (mental or written) of what you're currently attached to:
- People
- Places
- Beliefs
- Memories
- Things
- Roles/Identities

For each one, ask: **"Is this nourishing me (supporting growth, bringing love, creating flow) or draining me (keeping me stuck, controlling me, blocking flow)?"**

If nourishing—gratitude. Keep it.  
If draining—awareness. Consider release.

**Shell Check:**  
Notice your protective mechanisms today. When do you retreat into your shell? When do you come out?

Both are necessary. The question is: **Are you using your shell consciously (to protect when needed), or unconsciously (to hide from life)?**

**Let the River Flow:**  
If you feel emotion today—especially sadness, grief, or overwhelm—**don't suppress it**.

Find a private moment. Let it flow. Tears, sound, movement—whatever the emotion needs.

Say: "This is my river. It flows through me. It nourishes me."

### Applying This Teaching

Cancer teaches: **You need protection AND vulnerability. You need boundaries AND openness. You need attachment to nourish you, not trap you.**

In a world that often says "be open, be vulnerable, let go of everything," Cancer reminds us: **No. You need your shell. You need your boundaries. You need to protect your soft center.**

But in a world that also says "be tough, don't cry, don't attach, don't need anyone," Cancer also reminds us: **No. You need connection. You need to let the river flow. You need to attach to what nourishes you.**

**The wisdom is in the balance.**

Know when to retreat into your shell (when you're overwhelmed, when you need rest, when you're unsafe).

Know when to come out of your shell (when it's time to receive nourishment, when it's time to connect, when hiding is no longer serving you).

And consciously choose **what you attach to**—not to avoid attachment altogether, but to attach to rivers (that nourish and flow) rather than chains (that bind and drain).

## Aquarius Physical Week Context

We are in the Physical Week of Aquarius, and today we connect with the **plexus chakra**—the center of personal power, identity, and self.

Cancer, as the soul of the Water Trinity, teaches us that even in the new Aquarian age of networks and freedom, **we still need nourishment, protection, and healthy attachment**.

The network is not built by isolated individuals. It's built by **connected individuals** who know how to protect themselves AND open to others.

Cancer shows us: **The path to the center is through knowing what nourishes you.**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does "Kar" (the root of Cancer) mean, and why is it significant?

**"Kar"** means "something hard that protects something soft"—like a shell. This is the essence of Cancer: **hard exterior, soft interior**. Protection around vulnerability. The crab embodies this perfectly—a hard carapace protecting a soft body. This teaches us that **boundaries are not coldness; they are care for the vulnerable self within**.

### Q: Why is Cancer the disease named the same as the constellation?

Because ancient Greek physicians saw that the disease created **a structure of dead cells surrounding an organ**—like a hard shell around something soft. Linguistically, they used the same word (**karkinos** = crab/shell) to describe both the animal and the disease structure. **It's not mystical—it's linguistic observation.**

### Q: How is Cancer different from Pisces in the Trinity of Water?

**Pisces** = the **ocean** (spirit)—wide, open, holding everything, where you feel all as one.

**Cancer** = the **rivers** (soul)—flows that create links, connections, and nourishment between different bodies of water.

**Scorpio** = the **wells** (body)—deep, locked, internal, contained waters of transformation.

Cancer is the **relational, nourishing, connecting** energy.

### Q: What does "attachment is a tool, not a prison" mean?

Attachment itself is **neutral**. It's not inherently good or bad. What matters is **what you're attached to and whether it nourishes or drains you**.

A baby attached to a mother = **nourishing** (supports life and growth).  
A person attached to trauma = **draining** (keeps them stuck).

**Choose your attachments consciously.** Attach to what supports your evolution.

### Q: Why does the summer solstice relate to Cancer?

The summer solstice (longest day of the year) occurs when the Sun is directly above the **Tropic of Cancer**. This is the **peak of light**—the moment of maximum solar power. But it's also the **turning point**—after this, days begin to shorten. Cancer teaches: prepare, protect, nourish, because nothing stays at the peak forever. The cycle turns.

### Q: How are tears related to Cancer's teaching?

Tears are **water**—the element of Cancer. They are the **emotional release**, the river flowing. Cancer teaches that **tears are not weakness; they are nourishment**. They cleanse. They connect us to what we feel. When you cry, you're letting the river flow, releasing what's been held in the shell. This is **healthy, necessary, and sacred**.

### Q: What does "I Am the Path to the Centre" mean?

The plexus chakra is your **center**—your "I am," your personal power, your identity. **You are the one who knows your center.** You are the one who chooses what enters your shell, what you attach to, what nourishes you. You are the path to your own sovereignty. No one else can walk it for you.
