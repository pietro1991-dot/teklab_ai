## Introduction

Foreign I don't know if you can hear me or not just to tell you that I had so much low energy I I was feeling so bad yesterday that in the moment I finished the transmission and I closed the window of them that I was working with here for YouTube the the video disappeared and and the whole screen disappear and everything went down and the computer couldn't run it didn't work until today so today after I went to the pyramid and I started to be much more relaxed so today I align myself in the pyramid I felt better and I went back to the to the room and the computer worked so it was connected to me but it did an update it and we need to updated I don't know something happened with the plugin of the camera and it's not working so I guess it's gonna be like this today so I'm trying to speak with someone I'm speaking right now with someone for the phone to try to solve it but I don't know so so only with my with my state of vibration yesterday I almost broke the computer so imagine so now you know that it's better not to be close to me when I when I am in a low vibration and to open it in the phone but I don't have I only have 50 of battery sorry that also because I am really really bad with technology nobody gave me the the passwords for the things unless it's really necessary so I'm waiting for someone to give me possible how am I doing this is a mess so anyway Asylum I don't think that there is much more to speak about because I guess that today has been very to the point in the blog I think that everything is already set so I don't have all the things here to solve the problem also because there's a wedding of course and I'm not in my place so the thing that I wanted to talk about today was regarding the the two visions of the ego that I speak at the beginning of the post today in the blog so just to to let you know for all the new people that is following the path that that all the information of what we are talking about and what am I am I because why am I referring to to the post I'm referring to in every one of these videos is www. Yosoi. Red you saw it meaning I am in Spanish and red meaning Network in Spanish so you have all the information there for those who don't know what am I talking about so something that I wrote today in the post that I would love for you to understand better which is regarding the ego so we have two fundamentals two fundamental things in in the universe in the mental Universe which is the ego and the essence so we have spoken about what Essence is but I would like for you to for us to see that again for a moment so remember with me the etymology of essence essence comes from three words one that is s that means to be in in European languages the other one is and that means the one the subject the one that makes the action and the third one is yeah that in English becomes an e a letter e meaning the quality of something the quality of something so Essentia essence means the quality of a subject to be the quality of a subject being something okay that's what Essence means essence Essentia has the concept of Essence has the concept in the universe of the one that simply is that's why that's why the last sentence to summarize the entire universe is this is it this is it so or is like this so the idea of of this is that the Universe basically is what it is it's nothing else what it really is so the universe is basically a subject expressing the quality of being the only thing that really exists in the universe is this being expressing itself being itself so that would be the essence the quality that reminds us that everything is what it is so Essence is the center of all the things of every being because all are related to the topic of to be so in the other hand of essence we have existence so we have two things in the universe the essence and the existence so if Essence is the quality of a subject just being just being existence existence is the quality of the being that is out of itself is out of the essence so existence come from the word X that means to go out from there comes the word ex exit and it comes from the word study that means to be in a place to stay so X study means that you live the place where you are to go into another one existence so this means that the essence is the being that it is that is in one place and the existence is the being that gets out from that place so how does this being exist meaning going out well it is by expansion expansion is to expand so X meaning out and pan mean everything so expansion is the action to go out to the everything to the whole so remember as we have said that the essence is just to be it's just to be there is that one particle that starts to move through different times and spaces that projects itself projects means to be thrown a way to project in this projection is what we spoke about the particles being only one projected in many okay like multiplied by thousands by many in different times and different spaces that's how the essence starts to exist starts to expand around in many other particles so what are these particles around doing in the periphery which is around the sphere around the center what they are doing there is to create networks to connect around synapses of many new ideas of itself so the essence the being can transform its idea of itself so each one of these dots of these particles coming from the essence will be how to refer to themselves referred to themselves in order to look for tools for the essence to learn and to expand and because these particles are referring to itself we call them egos so remember the essence is only one spot the essence just is there's nothing else that the essence can do so in order to know itself to understand itself it needs to expand to exist to move away this Essence in order to observe itself it will go out expand and from this expansion is it starts to exist and by existing moving out these other particles of itself these other projections in different times in space will understand will give to the essence different points of view different projections ideas of itself and those particles are called egos so as you can see now every ego in the universe every individual that refers to itself that can see around the universe the reality is just a projection of the essence of the Divine Essence it's just a projection of the Divine Essence through time and space the egos then are just extensions of the Divine Essence trying to understand itself to experience itself so the egos are basically the tools of the essence to understand itself the tools that move forward creating networks around synapses changing and exchanging points of views so they can create tools to understand better and can become okay so now from the point of view of existence we look into the ego from a very different way because we see that the ego is like this being full with Things fill up with many different things this is why we see the ego as something that doesn't allow us to see the essence to connect with the essence because it's so full with many tools and stuff that doesn't allow us to see the pureness what usually happened when we make the questions ourselves who am I what is the essence how can I reach the essence of myself the first thing that people teach us is how to get rid of the ego because the ego is the one that doesn't allow us to see that essence and it's in thus in that moment when we start to confuse ourselves and to judge the ego so this point of view is not the reality because when we see it from the point of view of the essence the ego is the one that has been harvesting all this data from the biological point of view the emotional point of view the the beliefs that help the essence to have a new point of view so as you see the problem here is not the ego the problem here is that we are not taking responsibility on the tools that the ego has in order to see the essence so it is when we are not responsible of our biological history of our traumas emotional world when we are not responsible of our beliefs and our values that's the moment when the ego becomes an impediment something that denies us to connect with the essence so we can understand now that the essence is that being that has the quality of just to be and the ego is the one that through the existence allows that being to have a different point of view to be able to open ourselves to have different points of views allows us to expand and that's the key of evolution when we start to connect with the essence we start to realize that everything that exists is referred to myself that everything around is just a reflection of me when we start to connect to the essence we suddenly start to feel that we are very important that we had other lives and we start to remember other lives and that we have a mission and that we are part of something that unites us all and when we start to connect with the essence suddenly we start to say I am very important when I have come to do to this world is really important it's my mission and also we start to perceive ourselves as very important that we have come to this world to do something very important that from the beginning of the universe from The Source the main source of the universe of the cosmos we have been sent by someone bigger greater than has sent us to do something important to this world and when we start to do is to decorate those things that we feel from the essence with the tools of the ego and we start to leave that mission from the essence Through The Eyes of the ego and when you start to get much more aware of the things suddenly a question comes up which is really me I'm mine the chosen one to do this the ego starts to do the question when we start to connect with the essence suddenly we realize that there is no one else around that it's just a projection and suddenly the ego asks itself am I the only one that exists and the only possible answer to this is yes it is it is like this so the thing is that the essence is the only thing that exists so everything that we see everything that we experience what we are is simply a way of that essence so the only possible answer is it is we are all important we are all that essence and here we have two types of egos in the existence the ego that believes is important because of his history and the ego that knows that is important because he choose that history the ego that believes is important that believes that is important shouts out loud that is important the ego that knows that is important keeps the calm and don't shut up and don't speak out loud is calm and I guess that it has been really important that today we don't have an image of my face and speaking about this Essence and existence and this two faces of the ego we don't have my face we have only one dot that is expanding everything is perfect the vibration for today is the statement for today is I am the Eternal Vision the code for today is Kenny's manual Orion the giant had two hunting dogs that helped him in his hunting trips the younger and the older the major dog the other one is the most known one for its heart is the brightest star serious it is the guide dog the faithful friend that showed the direction that shows us the way and protects us from what we can't see like the ego let's go to the alignment sit comfortable close your eyes and concentrating your
