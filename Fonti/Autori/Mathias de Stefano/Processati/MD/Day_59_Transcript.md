# Day 59: Decision and Election - Choosing from Essence

## Daily Practice Elements

**Morning Intention:** "I elect from my essence, not from my needs."

**Key Affirmation:** "I am the greed of experiences."

**Soul Pattern Vibration:** SCOOL

**Physical Focus:** Ankles, feet, foundation of movement

**Meditation Practice:** I Am integration - unifying ego and essence through higher self

## Overview

Today we distinguish between two fundamentally different ways of choosing: **decision** and **election**. The Latin root of "decision" means "to cut" or "divide" - it eliminates options. "Election," however, means "to choose" or "recreate" - it affirms what you want to create, not just what you want to avoid.

This teaching explores the difference between choosing from **need** (the ego's external hunger, the "I") and choosing from **essence** (your being's internal truth, the "I Am"). The feet and ankles - our contact with ground, our foundation for each step - represent where these choices literally land in physical reality.

The radical proposition: **I and I Am are not separate**. The ego isn't the enemy; it's one kidney in the organism of self. The higher self - vibrating as "Gun" - integrates both into unified choice from essence rather than desperate reaction to need.

## Core Teaching

### Decision vs. Election: Etymology Reveals Purpose

**Decision** comes from Latin *decidere*: "to cut off, divide, separate."
- When you decide, you eliminate options
- You cut away possibilities
- The focus is on what you DON'T want
- It's reactive: avoiding pain, escaping limitation

**Election** comes from Latin *eligere*: "to choose, select, pick out."
- When you elect, you affirm what you're creating
- You select your desired reality
- The focus is on what you DO want
- It's creative: moving toward essence, expressing potential

Both have value, but election creates while decision merely eliminates. Make decisions about what to avoid; make elections about what to become.

### Need (Ego/I) vs. Essence (Being/I Am)

**Need** originates from external lack:
- "I need love" (because I feel its absence)
- "I need security" (because I fear danger)
- "I need validation" (because I doubt myself)
- The "I" that needs is the ego encountering the world

**Essence** originates from internal truth:
- "I Am love" (regardless of external circumstances)
- "I Am secure in being" (regardless of external threats)
- "I Am valid" (regardless of external opinions)
- The "I Am" that is needs nothing because it already contains everything

Choosing from need creates dependency - you remain enslaved to whatever fills the lack. Choosing from essence creates authenticity - you express what you already are.

### I vs. I Am: Unity, Not Opposition

The common spiritual error treats ego (I) as enemy and essence (I Am) as goal. But this creates internal war. The truth: **I and I Am are one organism with different functions**, like two kidneys.

The **ego (I)** interfaces with external reality:
- Navigates physical world
- Manages relationships
- Handles practical needs
- Accumulates experiences

The **essence (I Am)** maintains internal reality:
- Holds your core being
- Knows your truth
- Provides direction
- Generates meaning

Both are necessary. A person without ego can't function in the world. A person without essence has no authentic self to express. The goal isn't killing the ego; it's integrating ego and essence under the direction of the higher self.

### The Higher Self: Gun Vibration

The **higher self** - vibrating as "Gun" - is the organizing intelligence that unifies I and I Am. It's not "higher" in the sense of "better than" the ego; it's higher in the sense of "overseeing, integrating, directing."

Like a conductor with an orchestra:
- The ego plays its instrument (external interface)
- The essence plays its instrument (internal truth)
- The higher self conducts both into harmony

When the higher self directs, your elections come from essence while your ego implements them in reality. This is choosing from I Am (essence) through I (ego) - unified action.

### From Ideology to Biology

**Ideology** says: "I should choose X because my beliefs/culture/values say so."

**Biology** says: "I choose X because my being recognizes itself in this."

The shift from ideology to biology is the shift from external programming to internal authority. Your body knows what nourishes it; your being knows what expresses it. This isn't rejecting wisdom from others - it's testing that wisdom against your own organism's truth.

When you elect from biology (essence), even difficult choices feel aligned. When you decide from ideology (external shoulds), even "correct" choices feel forced.

### The Controlled vs. Autonomous Paradox

The false dichotomy: "Am I controlled by external forces, or am I autonomous?"

The truth: **You are an organism within larger organisms.** Your cells are controlled by your body while being autonomous cells. Your body is controlled by Earth's ecosystem while being an autonomous being. Control and autonomy coexist.

The question isn't "controlled or free?" but "Am I consciously participating in the larger organism, or unconsciously reacting?" When you elect from essence, you participate consciously. When you decide from need, you react unconsciously.

## Practice: I Am Integration Meditation

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Preparation:**
- Sit or stand with feet flat on ground
- Feel your ankles and feet as your foundation
- Breathe naturally, following breath to your root

**The Meditation:**

1. **The I - Ego Interface (5 minutes)**
   - Bring attention to the front of your body, your face, your hands
   - This is your "I" - your interface with the world
   - Notice all the needs arising: comfort, validation, security, love
   - Don't judge them; simply witness: "This is my ego navigating reality"
   - Feel the external orientation: reaching out, responding, reacting

2. **The I Am - Essence Core (5 minutes)**
   - Shift attention to your spine, your core, your center
   - This is your "I Am" - your essential being
   - Notice the presence that needs nothing because it already IS
   - Witness: "This is my essence, my truth, my ground"
   - Feel the internal orientation: resting in being, knowing, existing

3. **The Gun - Higher Self Integration (5 minutes)**
   - Expand awareness to include both front (I) and core (I Am)
   - Visualize a golden light above your head - the higher self, the conductor
   - This light descends, connecting ego and essence like two kidneys in one body
   - Neither is rejected; both are integrated
   - The Gun vibration harmonizes: "I Am choosing through I"

4. **Grounding the Election (3-5 minutes)**
   - Feel your feet on the ground, your ankles stable
   - From this integrated state, bring to mind a current choice you're facing
   - Ask not "What do I need?" (ego reaction) but "What am I?" (essence election)
   - Feel the answer in your body, not your mind
   - This is election from essence: choosing what recreates your truth

**Integration:**
Place hands on your belly. Speak: "I am the greed of experiences. My ego and essence are one organism. My higher self directs both. I elect from I Am through I."

## Key Insights

- Need originates from external lack (ego/I); essence originates from internal truth (being/I Am)
- I and I Am aren't enemies but one organism with different functions, like two kidneys
- Choosing from need creates dependency; choosing from essence creates authenticity
- The higher self (Gun vibration) integrates ego and essence like a conductor harmonizing instruments
- Ideology imposes external programming; biology recognizes internal authority
- The shift from ideology to biology is testing others' wisdom against your organism's truth
- Control and autonomy coexist - you're an organism within larger organisms
- Conscious participation (election from essence) vs. unconscious reaction (decision from need)
- Make decisions about what to avoid; make elections about what to become
- Feet and ankles represent where choices land in physical reality - your foundation for each step
- True choice comes from essence while ego implements it in reality - unified action

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Morning:** Before your feet hit the floor, ask: "What am I today?" (essence) rather than "What do I need today?" (lack). Let your first step on the ground be an election from I Am.

**Throughout the Day:** When facing choices, pause:
- **Decision check:** "Am I choosing to avoid/eliminate?" (cutting away)
- **Election check:** "Am I choosing to create/become?" (affirming truth)
- Shift from decision to election whenever possible

**Evening:** Review your day's choices:
- Which came from need (external lack)?
- Which came from essence (internal truth)?
- Were your ego (I) and essence (I Am) working together or fighting?

### Applying the Teaching

**With Major Life Choices:**
- Don't ask "What do I need?" (dependence on external filling)
- Ask "What am I?" (expression of internal truth)
- Test the choice in your body: Does it feel like grasping (need) or recognition (essence)?
- Make the election from I Am, then use your I to implement it practically

**With Daily Decisions:**
- Notice when you're deciding to avoid pain vs. electing to create joy
- Both have value, but favor elections when possible
- "I elect health" is more powerful than "I decide to avoid sickness"
- The energy moves toward what you elect, away from what you decide against

**With Ego-Essence Integration:**
- Stop treating your ego as the enemy
- Recognize it as your necessary interface with external reality
- Practice: "My ego handles the world; my essence holds my truth; my higher self directs both"
- When ego-needs arise, don't suppress them - trace them back to essence:
  - "I need love" → "I Am love needing expression"
  - "I need security" → "I Am seeking alignment with my truth"
  - The need reveals the essence trying to express itself

## Q&A

**Q: How do I know if a choice is from need or essence?**
A: Need feels like grasping, urgency, dependency - "I must have this or I'll be diminished." Essence feels like recognition, resonance, expansion - "This expresses what I already am." Check your body: need contracts; essence expands.

**Q: Aren't some needs legitimate and necessary?**
A: Absolutely. Your body needs food, shelter, safety. But even these can be approached from essence rather than desperate lack. "I need food" (lack) vs. "I Am a being that nourishes itself" (essence). The action is the same; the consciousness is different.

**Q: What if my ego wants something my essence doesn't?**
A: Usually, this means your ego has misidentified what will satisfy the need. Trace the ego's want back to its source - often you'll find an essence truth trying to express itself but targeting the wrong object. The higher self helps redirect the ego's energy toward what truly serves your essence.

**Q: How is "election from essence" different from "following my desires"?**
A: Desires often come from need (external lack). Essence comes from being (internal truth). Ask: "Does this desire come from feeling I'm missing something, or from recognizing what I already am?" The second is essence.

**Q: Can I make elections for other people?**
A: No. You can only elect for yourself. You can decide for others in certain roles (parent for child), but you cannot elect their essence - only they can know and choose what they truly are. Attempting to elect for others is control, not love.

**Q: What's the practical difference between decision and election?**
A: Decision: "I decide not to eat sugar" (cutting away). Election: "I elect vitality" (affirming). Both might result in not eating sugar, but election is creative and positive while decision is reactive and negative. Election has more sustainable power.

**Q: How do I access my higher self (Gun)?**
A: You don't access it; you already are it. The practice is recognizing it. Sit in meditation with awareness of both your ego (external interface) and essence (internal being). The awareness that can observe both IS the higher self. It's not somewhere else; it's the perspective that includes everything.

**Q: What does "greed of experiences" mean?**
A: The insatiable appetite to know through living, not just thinking. The universe's hunger to experience itself in infinite forms. Not greed for possessions, but greed for the fullness of existence. Your I Am expressing itself through endless I encounters.

**Q: What's the SCOOL vibration?**
A: SCOOL is the signature of experiential learning - the vibration of the eternal student who learns through being rather than studying. It's the sound of essence accumulating wisdom through lived experience, integrating I Am with I through actual participation in life.
