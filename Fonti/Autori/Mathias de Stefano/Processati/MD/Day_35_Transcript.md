## Overview

Day 35 takes us deep into the solar plexus chakra and the complex web of **attachments** that define our personality and shape our relationships with the external world. Matias begins by sharing that through doing this daily homework himself—going to the pyramids, doing meditations, focusing—he's been surprised by how many things he's solved in such a short time. This is the power of consistent inner work: transformation happens faster than we expect when we actually do the practice rather than just thinking about it.

Today's teaching reveals that attachments are not inherently bad things we must "cut away" in some spiritual bypass. Rather, attachments are **energy links** created when we receive energy from the outside world, retain it out of fear of losing it, and fail to complete the natural cycle of giving it back. These links connect us to people, situations, emotions, beliefs, and substances. They become problematic not because connection is wrong, but because we've interrupted the flow.

The heart chakra gives and receives. The plexus **processes** what the heart receives. It's like a digestive system for energy. When we receive something—love, food, an idea—we're meant to take it in, transform it, and give something new back out. But when we're afraid we won't receive again, we hold onto it. That retention creates stagnation, and stagnation creates the quantum link we call attachment.

The teaching uses powerful examples: the apple we eat should nourish us and then be released as waste back to the earth, creating compost for the tree. Love from a relationship should activate love in us, which we then share in new ways. An idea from a conversation should be processed and returned as new thinking. The circuit must flow. When it stops, we get sick—physically, emotionally, mentally.

Most radically, Matias explains that some of the "good things" from our past create stronger attachments than the "bad things" because we desperately want them to continue and fear their loss. Meanwhile, terrible events sometimes push us forward precisely because we want to move away from them. The task is not to judge attachments as positive or negative, but to recognize them, understand their origin, and learn to adjust the "guitar strings" of our energy rather than cutting them entirely.

## Core Teaching

### Matias's Personal Experience with Daily Practice

Matias shares an important update: Since beginning this daily work—going to the pyramids every day, doing the meditations, focusing on all the concepts—he realized he had solved many things in such a short time. He was surprised about all the things he'd worked through in this tiny, short period of time. Of course, he's doing it every day constantly.

He reminds us: "Don't worry, you can do it whatever, at the moment you feel ready to do it, at your own time."

### Understanding Attachments Through the Plexus

Today is about the plexus. The plexus means the attachments. For sure, in the consciousness world, something we usually hear a lot is "Can we detach ourselves from other things?" This is—it's important to realize and understand what it means to be attached and what it means to be detached, to get detached.

The reason we relate the attachments to the plexus is that from the plexus is from where we weave all these links around. All these links we have to the outer world come back to the core, to the plexus, creating the idea of the personality. **The links create that personality we are.**

### The Circuit from Heart to Plexus

To relate and to understand, we need to go to understand the relation the plexus has with the heart chakra. We saw yesterday, let's remember: from the mind level, the heart means the service, to be on service. Remember that in order to be in balance with your service, you have to realize about the circuit of the energy from the giving and the receiving.

These are the two extensions of the heart—my arms and my hands—realizing that the heart is the middle of the giving and receiving. This means that everything I will receive will come to my heart.

Let's try to pay attention to the mechanism of how it works. At the moment I receive something, it goes through my heart, and I have to give something in another point of view. I give something, and the universe must give me something back in order to feel—to fulfill, filling up is better—yeah, to fill up my heart, the vacuum that I created.

All the time I give, I have to receive in the same amount of energy. Let's be clear about this: **the energy that I receive back is in the same vibration as I give it.** Pay attention to that.

### Vibration Versus Intention

It's not—it's vibration, not intention. It's a very different thing: vibration and intention.

To picture the difference: **Vibration is what I feel. Intention is something I would love it to be.**

For example, I am sad today. I am sad, and I am willing to be happy tomorrow. That will be the intention. I said it's for the future. The vibration is what it is.

Pay attention to this example. Maybe you feel related to this. You say, with a specific face, sound, sentence, I don't know: "I receive bad things. I give and give and always give in my life."

But what you are giving is just pain. It's just sadness, heaviness. Even if I am trying to give something really beautiful to someone else, the energy that I am putting to that beautiful thing I gave was low, was sad. I am just giving sadness.

You could know that it's not the same vibration and intention. Next time you maybe complain, "Why is this happening to me if I am doing all well?" That's that—because you are just complaining.

Remember that **the universe doesn't have any ethics or moral. The universe only sees energy and vibration.** If you are giving sadness, you will receive sadness just to understand. The universe is just trying to fill the voids with the same energy that went away. It's trying to reach the balance.

What you do is: if you are giving sadness, the universe will give you sadness because sadness was in the same vibration. Makes it make me understand that if I am willing to receive joy, I have to give joy for balance.

This is very important, fundamental to understand how the circuits work.

### Multiple Vibrations in Different Chakras

Remember, we are not only one emotion in our body. We are many. In each one of the chakras, we have different types of vibration. Also, we have to acknowledge: if the emotion is coming, or the thing I am giving is coming from the intestines, that's coming from the head, from that level. It's not about "if I want to feel joy, I have to give joy, and then I will be happy." No, it's not like that.

It's about to realize what I need is what I don't have in between all of them. It's not to become myself all happy constantly. It's about to use my own energy to use it to create joy.

### Using Low Vibration to Create High Vibration: The Comedian Example

Let's make an example of this. I can use a different energy to create a higher vibration to receive that other energy—new energy I don't have. This is **to laugh of your own disgrace, your own conflict.**

I take my lower vibration, my suffering, and I make it into a humor monologue. Suddenly, I create the lower vibration into laugh, into joy, and I receive joy.

Usually, this happens in people that have depression. The comedian people, usually, are not happy people. The comedians usually suffer depression in their lives. What they are doing is try to raise their vibration constantly to keep alive through taking the sadness and turning it into laughs, laughter.

What happens usually with many of the comedians is they are unaware, unconscious. They use the same energy of happiness they receive, but they don't know what to do with it, so they create more depression.

If you become aware, you use that energy to wake up.

**Two of the most clear examples for the whole world in this:** Robin Williams—he went down. Jim Carrey—going up. It's something that happens to all of us, normally, besides these examples.

### Retaining Energy Creates Attachment

We can use a dense energy to create another energy, a new energy. Let's remember and try to understand the level. Let's picture: when I create, when I recognize the circuit of giving and receiving, if I am unaware, if I am unconscious, I receive the energy, and I am afraid I may lose it. I keep it to myself.

"This is full, and I am afraid to give it. I don't want to lose it. I don't give. I just retain."

What happens? The energy starts to get stuck. I start to receive all the energy I can. I have so much, so much, I don't know what to do with all that I cannot process.

Do you usually send all the things you eat, you cannot process? Something is really difficult to be processed. Where does it go? **To the liver.** The liver tries to process the information.

### The Liver, Pancreas, and Stomach: Processing Energy

Do you know what the liver does in your body? It assimilates all the information as part of your personality. Once the energy was processed as information, as part of yourself, maybe there are some parts of the energy that is not being able to be processed. That is turned into another energy we call **anger**, we call **rage**, we call **hate**. It goes all to the liver.

The rest that was processed, it's taken as a nutrient to nourish the body. Where does it go? The thing that is being processed to be assimilated, it goes to the pancreas, it goes to the stomach. There it stays. It becomes part of myself.

But that energy is not mine. Remember, it was an energy I received to do something, then give it away. Because I was afraid to lose it, I retain it inside myself.

### The Quantum Link of Attachment

What that means? The energy I have within right now is not in resonance with me. It's in resonance with the object or the subject from where it came from. Does it generate, in the quantum level, **a link of attachment**?

Do you follow? Do we explain what is that? The energy that is inside of me doesn't belong to me. I was just supposed to receive the energy to do something, to create something, then leave it away. Because I keep it inside, it still is related with the outside.

We will always need—for the external energy in a world—in a physical world, we are interacting in a network. Usually, these nutrients we are going to receive from the outer world to create ourselves will be coming from the food, from emotions, and from thoughts. All that energy is something I take, I transform, and I give away. Take, transform, give away.

### The Apple Example: Natural Energy Cycle

A simple example: I have an apple. I take the apple from the tree. I eat it. The apple gives me everything I need in my body. The rest I don't need, I give it back to the earth with the shape of poop. I just simply giving and receiving, giving and receiving.

The apple I ate becomes compost for the tree.

In the emotional level, we usually—what we are supposed to do is: I meet someone, I get in love. That person loves me, gives me its love. I activate the love. I feel it. Suddenly, it activates many things within me. Then I supposedly have to deliver back, saying, "I love you," giving the energy again to the person.

Through the mind, for example, I meet someone. We discuss about something. That person gives me an idea. I process the idea. I think about the idea. I absorb every idea. Then I transform it within, like in a new kind of concept. I give it back. I deliver again in the chat, talking about, "Oh, this is my thinking about what you have talked to me."

Everything is just a cycle.

### Positive and Negative Energy in the Circuit

Someone was asking about the negative. The negative is not bad. It's just another energy. Try to picture that it's not—it's also not good to have a lot of positive energy within. The positive energy makes the machine constantly work, constantly. You lose a lot of energy. You are constantly working with the energy. It goes too fast.

The negative energy does to slow, make the machine work slower. Also, the negative energy can stop the machine at all at the end. This is why both of them are necessary.

That's why it's so important the circuit, constantly.

### Getting Stuck in the Sacrum: The Attachment Point

Let's go to what it means to be attached to an energy. Picture the idea: you eat the apple. Suddenly, your body is afraid to leave away the apple by going to the bathroom. You are afraid you don't know what you're going to eat anymore. Suddenly, you hold the apple inside.

Imagine you have received love, lots of love. Suddenly, the relationship ends. You say to yourself, "I don't know if I'm going to be able to love again. I don't know if I am even beloved again." What I do? I just hold the love, the emotion inside. I'm afraid to leave it away.

For example, with a belief, it also happens. I receive an idea. I transform the idea. Suddenly I say, "If I say this, everyone will believe I'm crazy. I better shut up. I don't give anything." I made it. I believe.

### The Digestive Process Metaphor

The simple aspect to understand how this process of energy works is just by: you eat, you eat something. Digestive process—nutrients stay in your body, then shit goes away. The process is constant in the physical, the mental, and the emotional level.

If I eat, I receive, I make the process of digest, the digestive process, I take the nutrients, take the nutrients—but I don't do it, I don't leave it away, I don't give it away. **It stops. It gets stopped.**

In the physical level, for example, I get addicted to something I would eat. In the physical level, we can relate that with: I cannot live away, I cannot leave away the energy. **I am attached to a food.** For example, maybe chocolate. For example, "I need chocolate to keep living. I need chocolate. I need chocolate." Or also a drug. You become addicted to some drug, whatever, whatever you ingest—something physical you became addict to, addicted to.

In the emotional level, it's in relation with a person or a situation. For example, in a situation, maybe I put myself in a situation constantly once again. It makes me feel safe even if I know it makes me bad.

For example, in the emotional with a person: you had a very deep love with someone. It was terrible. It ended. You will look for different people that will remind you to that first love. You could still be living the same. That's an addiction to an emotion.

For example, in the mind, the ideas: it's like you had a belief that makes you feel good. You you know it's not good, even though you are attached to it, and you go, you go once and again to the same belief, even if you know it makes you bad.

I'm not speaking about things I feel attached to that make us fine. I'm speaking about things that I do that I know they make me bad, but I do it anyway. Basically, it's to repeat something I know that makes me bad.

### Love Versus Attachment

For example, we talk about music. You cannot be addicted to music. For example, it's like maybe you love music. You need music to live. It doesn't make you bad to just love music. It's like saying, "I love family. I love to be with my family." That's not an attachment. That's just I'm loving my family.

When do you realize it is an attachment? You want to go with your family even if they are shouting at each other, screaming at each other, they make you bad, and you still want to be with them.

The moment I detach from something I was attached to is not by saying, "I just don't want this anymore. I leave. I leave the way. I cut the relation." No. It's not that.

### Adjusting the Guitar Strings: The Origin of Attachment

The moment I really detach from something is I go to the origin of why I started to enjoy it, why I started to suffer with it.

The example given today in the blog was: **if the chords of my guitar are entangled, they are not sounding very well. I won't go and just cut the chords to solve the problem.** What I am supposed to do is to recognize which chord is the one that is attached, then go to the origin and adjust it.

It's not about to cut the cords. It's about to adjust the cords by finding the origin of that chord.

For example, I am feeling I cannot love someone. It was the first relationship I had in which I felt I wouldn't be able to love someone else. This is not the month to make the adjustment. This month is to just recognize. Adjustment is the month to recognize. We are working with Virgo.

Virgo is not asking what is the sense, the meaning of all. Virgo is saying, "Okay, I have all this mess. How do I organize all these parts?" This is not the month to make the adjustment, just to recognize the chords.

## Practice

### Preparation

Remember, sit properly, comfortable. Stretch the body, yawn, massage the body, caress the body. Honor the body for being the anchor of the spiritual in the matter. Relax the body, focusing in the breathing.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Solar Plexus

1. **Deep breathing.** Take a deep breath. Go with the oxygen through your nose, your lungs, heart, blood, organs, and muscles. Take a moment to feel the heat within my body going outside through my skin, filling up my magnetical field, my aura.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Be aware of the light of the I Am over your head. Bring all the energy with your imagination from around the body, going in a spiral, making the I Am brighter and brighter.

3. **Descend through the chakras.** Take a deep breath. Feel and recognize the light of the I Am coming down, going through the crown of beliefs, the center of my head filled with qualities, my throat of truth, my heart and its service. How it shines going down, filling up all my plexus.

4. **Recognize the octopus of links.** Take a deep breath. Recognize and become aware that in this center are united all the links that connect me with the outer world. Become aware that it's all the energy that creates my personality. Observe the energy from the core of my plexus shining out with the streams and links, like if they are an octopus, a jellyfish.

5. **Acknowledge attachments without judgment.** Recognize all the links I have, all the attachments I perceive are just the reaction of my incapacity to give, to live away, to let it go. Recognize that all these links I have are not something I must cut. They are just unbalanced links of energy I need to take back to the equilibrium. Just simply observe and recognize the links, the attachments I have. Recognize them.

6. **Bring consciousness to the links.** Take a deep breath and bring all the light of the I Am to the plexus to bring clarity and consciousness to all these links and attachments that create my personality.

7. **Pronounce the vibration.** Take a deep breath and start to pronounce the vibration: **Nï... Nï... Nï...** Expanding the light of the I Am, transforming the paws of the octopus of energy into brighter rays of light, like a brighter sun.

8. **Embrace unity.** Yes, in its light, I recognize: "I am the Emissary of Unity. For every link are connected to me and only me. From my infinite potential, I am ever able to balance them. I am the Emissary of Unity. I am the Emissary of Unity."

9. **Recognize the learning.** My message is that I have to recognize each one of these links has given me something to learn, and now I must be able to also learn to give. I am the Emissary of Unity.

### Closing

Take your hands to your heart. Recognize: "Every attachment and detachment find in summary word in the process of learning and being. For everything I give and receive, everything is inside and outside is one. I am the Emissary of truth, of unity. I am the Emissary of Unity."

From my heart, bring all the consciousness towards all my body. Caress, stretch, massage, yawn. Come back and gently open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write down the things you feel you are attached to and the things you feel detached from.

Don't judge these attachments as good or bad. Simply recognize them. Some attachments might be to people, some to substances, some to emotions, some to beliefs, some to possessions. Some detachments might feel like freedom, others like loss or disconnection.

Remember, the work right now is not to cut the strings or force detachment. It's to recognize which guitar strings are entangled, which are making discord. Later, you'll learn to adjust them at their origin.

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice when you're holding onto something—a feeling, a thought, an object, a relationship dynamic—out of fear of losing it. Notice the tightness in your body, the way your energy stops flowing when you grip instead of allowing the natural cycle.

Also notice when energy flows naturally: you receive something, you transform it, you give something new back. That's the circuit working. That's detachment in action, not as cutting away, but as participating in the dance of exchange.

When you catch yourself in victim mentality ("I give and give but only receive pain"), check your actual vibration, not your intention. What are you actually broadcasting energetically? Sadness? Resentment? Fear? That's what's coming back to you.

Consider the comedian example: Can you take your suffering and alchemize it into something that serves? Can you transform low vibration into higher vibration consciously? That's using the circuit, not just being used by it.

## Q&A

### Q: If attachments create our personality, and we detach from everything, do we lose ourselves?

No. Detachment doesn't mean severing all connections. It means allowing the energy to flow rather than gripping it in fear. The links remain—they're what connect you to the world—but they become balanced, adjusted, harmonious rather than tangled and stuck. Your personality isn't destroyed; it's freed to express more authentically.

### Q: How can I tell if I'm attached to something or if I just genuinely love it?

Ask yourself: "Can I let this go if I need to? Can I enjoy it without clinging to it? Does it make me contract in fear of loss, or can I appreciate it while it's here and release it if it changes?" Love flows. Attachment grips. Love transforms energy and gives it back. Attachment holds energy and refuses to let it cycle.

### Q: The teaching says Robin Williams went down and Jim Carrey went up. What does that mean?

Both were comedians who transformed their suffering into humor, taking low vibration (depression, pain) and creating high vibration (laughter). Williams, despite bringing so much joy to others, couldn't find a way to use the joy he generated to heal himself—he remained unconscious of the circuit, and his depression deepened until it took his life. Carrey, facing similar struggles, became conscious of the pattern. He's actively working to transform the energy he generates, using it to wake up, to expand awareness. Same starting point, different levels of consciousness about the process.

### Q: If I'm attached to chocolate or coffee, is that really the same as being attached to a person?

The mechanism is the same, even if the intensity differs. You're retaining energy (the comfort, the stimulation, the feeling the substance gives you) because you fear you won't get that feeling again without it. The circuit gets interrupted—you take in but don't transform and release. Whether it's a substance, a person, an emotion, or a belief, the pattern of attachment functions identically at the energetic level.

### Q: What's the difference between going to the origin of attachment and making adjustments?

Going to the origin means understanding why and when the attachment formed. "I started holding onto this love because in my first relationship, I was abandoned." That's recognition. Making adjustments means working with that origin to heal it, transform it, release the energy. "Now I'm going to process that abandonment, feel it, understand it, and let it go." Recognition is Virgo work (this month). Adjustment is work for other months. Don't skip ahead. First, you must see clearly what's there.

### Q: The liver processes information and unprocessed energy becomes anger? Can you explain that more?

The liver, in energetic/emotional anatomy, assimilates experiences and integrates them into your sense of self. When you receive energy you can't process—too much, too intense, too foreign to your current state—the liver tries to break it down. What can't be integrated often converts to anger, rage, frustration. That's why people with liver issues often have anger issues, and vice versa. The organ and the emotion are linked. Detoxifying the liver (physically through diet, energetically through releasing old angers) helps process stuck attachments.

### Q: Is it possible to have too few attachments? To be too detached?

Yes. That's actually another form of attachment—attachment to non-attachment, to isolation, to self-sufficiency. True balance is participating fully in the circuit of exchange without gripping. If you're afraid to connect, afraid to receive, afraid to form bonds, you're still operating from fear, just in the opposite direction. The goal isn't to have zero links—it's to have flexible, flowing links that can adjust and adapt rather than rigid links that strangle.

### Q: How do I know if something I'm attached to is actually bad for me or if I'm just afraid?

Feel it in your body. Attachments that harm you create contraction, tension, depletion, even if they also give you something you crave. Healthy connections create expansion, ease, nourishment. But you must be ruthlessly honest with yourself. We're very good at convincing ourselves that harmful things are actually fine because we fear the discomfort of letting them go. Check: Does this consistently make my life smaller or larger? Does it consistently drain me or feed me? Not in moments, but in patterns over time.
