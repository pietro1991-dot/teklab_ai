## Overview

Day 34 brings us to the heart chakra, but not in the way we typically understand it. In the Mental Week of Virgo, the heart is not about love or emotion—it's about **utility and service**. This teaching radically reframes what it means to be useful or useless, transforming these loaded words from insults into essential tools for understanding how we exchange energy with the world.

Matias acknowledges that many people are struggling with the lists, finding them difficult or overwhelming. He emphasizes that this work is not school—there are no grades, no deadlines, no judgment. The lists are tools for your life, to be used whenever you feel ready. The reason for doing this work together, day by day, is to create a collective wave of energy and focus, but each person must honor their own timing and capacity.

The heart chakra, from the mental perspective, functions as a **transmitter**—a center that exchanges energy through giving and receiving. The two hands represent this circuit: one gives, one receives. The critical insight is that what we give and what we receive must be in balance, and more importantly, they must be aligned in **vibration**, not just intention. We might believe we're giving love, but if our vibration is actually sadness or heaviness, that's what we transmit. The universe responds to energy, not to our ideas about our energy.

The teaching on being "useful" and "useless" dismantles cultural conditioning from the Industrial Revolution, which taught us to see humans as tools for factories. Being "useless" at something isn't failure—it's recognition of where we need help, where we can receive from others. Being "useful" at something isn't superiority—it's recognition of what we can give. Both are essential for teamwork, for community, for the dance of energy exchange that creates harmony.

The core task today is brutally honest: write down what you are useful for and what you are useless for, without judgment. This isn't about self-flagellation or arrogance—it's about accurate assessment of your tools so you can participate fully in the collective work of existence.

## Core Teaching

### The Heart as Service and Utility

Today we work with the heart chakra. From the point of view of the mind—remember, we're in the Mental Week—the heart has no relation with love or emotion. Nothing. From the point of view of the mind, the heart is related with **service**.

Matias shares a personal moment of disconnection. He was trying to do something different with worship in English, trying to prepare linearly, step by step. But that's not how his higher self works. With his higher self, he sees the whole picture at once. So he had to wait for the complete information to come through, to reconnect with that higher vision rather than forcing a linear mental process.

This moment of waiting, of feeling disconnected, illustrates something important: being present with what is, rather than pretending. Maybe some people watching would ask, "Are you sad? Are you bad? Are you tired? You have to rest!" But no, he's fine. He's simply in the process of downloading information. If he felt bad, he would say so—there's no problem with that.

### The Relationship Between Beliefs, Qualities, and Truth

Let's download everything we've spoken about in these past days according to the blog. We have to understand the relationship:

**Beliefs** are the things I am expecting to be like. I suppose they are like this. I suppose they should be like this. That's a belief.

**Qualities** are the tools I inherit from those beliefs. My qualities, what I do, is to build my truth using these tools.

**Truth** is the fact I assimilate from that which I was perceiving.

Here's the difference: Belief is what I expect for things to be. Truth is what I accept that it is. Like this: I would like to clarify once again, for example, to make a difference between both of them.

A **truth** is, for example, the sentence: "The pencil is red." I can see it. I can touch it.

A **belief** is: "I believe that the pencil will only paint red."

Do you understand the difference?

The pencil is red—I can see it, I can touch it. That's truth. But the belief would say, "I believe that this pencil only paints in red." It's not the truth. You can paint with red, yes, but you can do other colors with it. You can do different colors from the red. It's something we need to make the difference between: what we accept as the truth and what we are waiting for it to be a truth.

### Tools of Beliefs and Tools of Truth

These are the tools for the belief. The **qualities** are the tools for the beliefs in my life. The qualities I have are going to be according to my beliefs. The qualities will be according to my beliefs. I will act in my life according to those beliefs and perceptions of my truth.

Remember that most of the abilities we have are coming from our history. I hope this is going better. The beliefs can come as a heritage—they can come from very far in the history. Remember, another great difference between beliefs and truth is that the belief can be inherited. We can bring information from the past, from the culture, inheriting it.

The truth is something I recognize myself, I have received for myself, interpreted by myself.

The qualities are the tools from the beliefs that I also inherit. The qualities are with me since I was born. It's not something I was creating through my life. The qualities are those things I have in my body, in my genetics.

We have on one side the qualities and the beliefs—a way to understand is that here in the crown chakra, the beliefs are the perceptions. Here in the third eye, the qualities are the tools of those perceptions. This will be repeated.

In the throat chakra, the **truth** will be the perception of truth. Here in the heart, we will have the **tools of that truth**.

From the third eye to the crown is something I can create myself or I can inherit—mostly I inherit from everything I see, that I receive. Those are things I can inherit from others. These are the two chakras that are in my present. This is related with my own truth I recognize and absorb.

Here, the heart—the heart is the tool that I myself am doing, that I myself am realizing in the present. It's not something I inherit or I have since I was born. It's something **I am deciding to do**.

### Giving and Receiving: The Circuit of the Heart

From my point of view in the reality, I share my truth or I share my lies. I receive truth or I receive lies. This brings us to the tool we have to share information: **giving and receiving**.

From the heart, the hands, the arms—we reach from the heart. If I give truth in balance—truth is balance of vibration—I will receive truth in the same direction. If I share a lie, the distortion of that vibration will be the same. I will receive lies.

This giving and receiving implies these two hands go to the heart. As I said, if the qualities are the tools I inherit related to my beliefs, what I have in my heart—my giving and receiving—are according to the truth or the lie I have within.

It could be like this: if I am vibrating low or bad, in distortion, I open myself with the distortion. I will receive distortion and lies.

### The Trap of Victim Mentality

I would love us to be very sincere with this. Sometimes we usually put ourselves in the victim side. We used to say, "I am totally open to love and all, but I have received is lies and bad things."

I am not speaking about love or to be like, "like, open." No. This is not emotion. This is mind. We are in the Mind Week. The heart is not love for the mind. For the mind, it's a transmitter. It's something that exchanges energy.

Everything I receive in my life will be according to the vibration of my heart. One thing is believing I am giving love. The other thing is that my heart is balanced on giving love.

We usually believe things. We don't usually do things.

Am I saying we need to do in order to prove that we are in balance in the vibration? The heart has two hands. **Do.** It says we need to do things, not only to believe things.

"I am giving love. I believe I am giving love. I believe I am giving love. I only receive hate." It's that I am believing, not that I'm giving.

For as much as we love—all of us—to say "I am living from the heart," it's very... for sure we are not living from the heart. It's all mind.

In order to really live from the heart, we have to do, is to be very clear, to analyze. Do we think? Otherwise, we will always be living through what we believe, what we think.

### Useful and Useless: Tools of Our Truth

In the system is: we have to acknowledge our **utility**—our usefulness—how to be useful or to be useless. That's easy in English. The way we have to understand the way of tools we have inside, the tools we have inside for our truth or our lies, is: How useful we are for others? How useless we are for others?

Matias wrote something today about being useless, and being useless is not something bad. **Being useless is the key to teamwork.** We wouldn't be able to work all together if I wouldn't be useless for some things and you wouldn't be useful for some other things.

The conflicts of useless, the conflict we have with the word "useless," comes from—it comes from the moment of the Industrial Revolution. In the Industrial Revolution, humans had been seen as tools for the factory—whether you are useful or whether you are useless.

After the Industrial Revolution, school was created in order to create tools for the factories, for the work—not people. This is why for a society that has been built for work, the worst word we could say to one of them is: "Useless. You are useless."

From there is that from there we have the conflict with the word.

### Recognizing Weakness Opens the Door to Help

We have to understand about the concept of useless is: recognizing myself as useless in some aspects helps me to realize I am weak in some parts of myself. To allow myself to ask for help to others.

Really, it's all a perception thing. By knowing, acknowledging myself I am useful for some things and useless for some others, helps me to know I have tools and stuff to help others that doesn't have what I have. And that I can allow myself to receive help for some other people in the things I don't have.

The reason we fail as individuals is that since we were children, we were taught: "You can do everything. You don't need anyone to do it. You can do it." They taught us to compete, to fight with the others. "I can do everything." We don't know how to work in community.

We want to do everything. Just look: the key to heal the competitive civilization we have is just to recognize to be useless in some stuff. It's not an insult. It's to recognize I need help.

We have put a negative weight in what it means to be useless and useful. I'm sure everyone has felt useless in your own life. We are 3,626 people. And all of you feel useless. If I dare myself to say, "I am useless for this," for sure there will be like 1,500 people that would say, "Oh, I know how to do it. Do you want me to help you?"

We usually say, "No, I can't say that I am useless. I met—the power is within me. I can do it." It's useless to say because it's a loss of time.

### The Example of Politicians

Now I'm going to say in something we all maybe recognize. For sure, you have heard these politicians that say they are going to be president. They say, "I can do it. I will change it. I will do blah blah blah blah."

Can one only person solve the problems of 50 million? It's impossible. We have to have 50,000 people to solve problems, but we all put our faith into one only person to solve the problems.

This is cultural. We have created a culture through a basement of competition. I am not speaking about capitalism. I'm speaking about every system.

If I recognize freely I can be useless and useful at the same time, I can work with a team.

### The Limitless Self vs. The Limited Personality

It's good to say also: "I can do whatever I want. Within myself, I have the potential of the whole universe. Everything is within me. I am limitless."

We have a problem that we ourselves are limitless, but our personality is not. We are limitless. Our cells can transform itself in thousands of things. We can die and transform and become anything we want through time and space. But our personality disappears. I am completely limitless.

But I am, in this tiny part of my experience, I have only these tools. I'm limited.

This is what I have to recognize: I need from the other infinite beings to make myself complete. Then we can go to the essence of all: that suddenly, I realized I am everything. I am the whole thing.

If I am everything, the other who I'm asking help to is another part of me. I am myself helping me in another shape. It's me.

Look how much we have separated ourselves as humans. When we say, "I can do everything," I think it's my personality. My personality is just another tool of everything I can do. I am everyone.

### Surrender is Not Defeat—It's Teamwork

To say to myself, "I cannot with this," is not just—it's not surrender to life. It's just to say, "I cannot do it. I will look for another tool, another one that can do it." Then we call it **team**. Recognizing that is how we can recognize.

Write down: "In what I am useless? Why? In what I am useful?"

It's a teamwork. The team is myself with everything.

## Practice

### Preparation

Remember, we start by doing massage, caressing the body. Remember we thank the physical body for being the anchor of the spirit in the matter. Focus on your breathing. Allow the weight of your body to fall down. Become aware of the oxygen going to your lungs, your heart, blood, organs, and muscles.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Heart Chakra

1. **Feel the heat within.** Allow yourself to feel the heat within your body, how it goes out through your skin, filling up your aura and all your magnetical field.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Think about the I Am as a light over your head. Feel, with your imagination, bringing all the energy around towards that light, making it irradiate brighter and brighter.

3. **Bring the I Am through your chakras.** Allow the light of the I Am to come down through all your body. Take a deep breath. Crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacrum, root. Then light your root chakra and the genitals.

4. **Bring light to the heart center.** Recognize—bring the light of the I Am through the crown of beliefs, through your qualities inside your head, through the truth inside your throat, shining in your heart, the center of your service.

5. **Recognize giving and receiving.** Recognize that from the center of your heart towards my shoulders, it expresses physically my arms and hands. The right is the giving. The left is the receiving. I become aware that in my right arm and hand is located the potential of all I have to give—everything in which I am useful. Try to think about your own perception of the things you are useful for. Recognize that.

6. **Acknowledge uselessness.** In the left side, your hand and arm, the receiving anchors the energy, the concepts of everything in which I think I am useless. Try to think and recognize all the things that you perceive yourself as useless.

7. **Pronounce the vibration.** Take a deep breath and start to pronounce the sound: **Ni... Ni... Ni...** As you see, shining brighter and brighter, the I Am in your heart going through your arms and hands, irradiating light and clarity to the concepts of being useless and being useful.

8. **Recognize the power of both.** I recognize, as I pronounce the vibration, that everything in which I consider myself useful is a service for others. Everything in which I consider myself useless is the service from others I can receive in me. It's my way of communication with others.

9. **Unite both hands.** Bringing the light of the I Am to my both hands, I recognize the power that both of them have. I recognize: "I am an Emissary of heart. I am the Emissary of heart. I am the Emissary of heart. I am the Emissary of the heart."

### Closing

Take both hands to your chest. Become fully aware: "I need both hands to be able to create. I recognize the power I have within to give is to accept. I can give my hand to somebody. I recognize I have the power to activate within the ability to ask for a hand when I am in need. I need help. I am giving and receiving. I am the Emissary of the heart."

Take a deep breath. Start to bring all the consciousness through all your heart, from your heart to all your body. Caress, massage, stretch, yawn. As you come back, gently open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write down two lists:
1. **In what I am useful** - The things you have to give, the areas where you can help others, the capacities you bring to the collective
2. **In what I am useless** - The things you cannot do, the areas where you need help from others, the gaps in your capacity

Write these **without judgment**. Being useless is not failure—it's recognition of where you need team, where you receive. Being useful is not superiority—it's recognition of what you contribute.

This is not about being exhaustive or complete. It's about honest assessment of your tools in service and exchange.

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice when you're struggling to do something alone that you could ask for help with. Notice the pride or shame that prevents you from saying, "I don't know how to do this. Can you help me?"

Also notice when someone asks you for help in something you're good at. Instead of thinking, "Why can't they figure this out themselves?" recognize: "Oh, this is where I'm useful and they're useless. This is the exchange. This is teamwork."

Start to see usefulness and uselessness not as judgments of worth, but as descriptions of capacity and need. You're useful in some things, useless in others. So is everyone. That's what makes collaboration possible.

When you find yourself saying, "I am living from the heart, I am giving love," check: Are you actually DOING acts of service and exchange, or are you just BELIEVING you are? The heart, in the mental week, is about action, not feeling. What are your hands actually doing?

## Q&A

### Q: How is the heart chakra different in the mental week versus the emotional week?

In the mental week (where we are now), the heart is about **utility, service, and exchange**—the mechanics of giving and receiving energy. It's about the circuit, the tools, the actual doing. In the emotional week (coming soon), the heart will be about the feelings associated with that exchange—love, connection, emotional bonds. Same chakra, different lens of examination. The mental lens asks: "How does this work?" The emotional lens will ask: "How does this feel?"

### Q: If I give from a place of sadness or distortion, why do I receive sadness back instead of the love I intended to give?

Because the universe responds to vibration, not intention. Your intention might be to give love, but if your energetic state is sadness, that's what you're actually transmitting. It's like trying to send a radio signal on one frequency while broadcasting on another—the receiver gets the actual frequency, not the one you wished you were on. This is why the work of examining our actual vibration (not our beliefs about our vibration) is so crucial. You must calibrate yourself to the vibration you want to transmit.

### Q: How do I know if I'm actually being useful or if I'm just telling myself I am?

Ask for feedback. Look at results. Being useful produces tangible effects in the world—people receive benefit from what you give. If you believe you're a great teacher but everyone who learns from you is confused, you're not useful as a teacher (yet). If you believe you're helping someone but they keep getting worse, you're not useful in that way. Usefulness can be measured by actual exchange and result, not by how good it makes you feel to think you're helping.

### Q: Isn't it selfish to focus on what I can receive from others (where I'm useless) rather than just being grateful for what I can give?

No. That's the old competitive programming talking. In true teamwork, recognizing where you need help is just as important as recognizing where you can help. If you refuse to receive, you block the circuit. Someone who's useful in that area doesn't get to give their gift. You deprive them of their service by refusing to acknowledge your need. Receiving is not selfish—it's completing the circuit.

### Q: What if I feel useless at everything? What if I can't think of anything I'm useful for?

That's a lie you're telling yourself, and a very deep one. It might come from depression, from trauma, from conditioning. But it's not true. You exist, therefore you have utility in the universe—even if it's just transforming oxygen into carbon dioxide for the plants. Start smaller. What can you do today that helps one person, one creature, one element of the ecosystem? Start there. Also, consider that feeling useless everywhere might be protecting you from risking yourself in the world. What are you afraid would happen if you acknowledged your utility?

### Q: The teaching says we need 50,000 people to solve problems, not one leader. But don't we need leadership and structure?

Yes, but there's a difference between leadership and messianic thinking. We've been conditioned to believe one person can and should solve everything—the president, the guru, the savior. This is a setup for failure and disempowerment. True leadership recognizes and coordinates the usefulness of many, acknowledging its own uselessness in areas where others excel. Structure built on teamwork is resilient. Structure built on one person's supposed omnipotence is brittle and fails.

### Q: How does this relate to the pencil example about truth and belief?

The pencil example shows the relationship between perception and expectation. "The pencil is red" is what you accept as true (perception). "The pencil only paints red" is what you expect to be true (belief). Similarly with service: "I am useful at teaching" might be true (perception). "Therefore I should be able to teach anyone anything" might be a belief that's false. The truth is bounded and specific. The belief often overgeneralizes. Understanding this prevents us from becoming rigid in our sense of usefulness or uselessness.

### Q: What should I do with this list once I've written it?

For now, just observe it. Notice patterns. Notice what surprises you. Notice what you resist acknowledging. The list is a diagnostic tool—it shows you your current assessment of your capacities. Later, you might discover you were wrong about some things (you're actually useful in areas you thought you were useless, or vice versa). The list will evolve. But it starts with honest acknowledgment of where you currently perceive yourself to be. That's the baseline for consciousness.
