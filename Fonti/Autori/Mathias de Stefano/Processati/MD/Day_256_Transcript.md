## Overview

Today we explore **struggle**—one of the most natural and misunderstood forces in existence.

In spiritual communities, there's often a belief that we should be peaceful, calm, never fight, never get mad, always maintain spiritual peace and love.

**But this is not reality. This is not even spiritual.**

Struggle is **natural**. It's **essential**. It's how all life survives, evolves, and thrives.

Understanding struggle means understanding life itself.

## Core Teaching

### Matias' Personal Note: The Spiritual Paradox

"I've been thinking about how this path is going to end. I don't know if by the end of this year I'm going to be a very zen-axis person or a very horrible person. I really don't know."

This honesty reflects the Aries energy of this week—direct, fierce, real.

If Matias were "loving and patient" this week while teaching about Aries emotional energy (anger, fight, struggle), it wouldn't be authentic teaching.

The teaching embodies the energy it's exploring.

### Struggle is Universal in Nature

Struggle exists in all living beings: insects, plants, minerals, mammals, reptiles, humans. Every living being struggles to survive.

The only difference with humans is that we've added culture, ethics, and morals to this natural process.

All struggle in nature relates to two fundamental needs: reproduction (transcendence) and defense (survival). Every being wants to transcend through reproduction and stay alive as long as possible through defense.

These two drives make us strive, make us fight with the environment to survive.

### Territory and Expansion

In order to thrive, living beings need food, space for reproduction, and space for security. This leads to the search for territory.

Beings expand and fight for territory—this is natural, not wrong.

This mechanism ensures survival. Each living being finds their own way to fight for space, protect their territory, and ensure reproduction.

When humans entered this process, we added culture to the pursuit of reproduction, territory, and defense.

### Etymology: The Hostile

When cultures organize territories, they expand beyond borders and acquire new territories through fight. This led to the concept of hostile.

Hostile comes from host (Latin), meaning foreigners, people from outside.

In ancient times, when foreigners came, it was often to conquer, take territory, or do harm. So "hostile" meant: those trying to do something bad from the outside to the inside.

But interestingly, we also use host to mean someone we expect from outside (a guest), and hospitality (welcoming the outsider). Same word, different context.

### Lucha: To Bend

The Spanish/Latin word Lucha (struggle/fight) comes from Léoq, meaning to bend.

Léoq became Luctatio (bending one another).

Related words include luxation (when bones separate and don't connect—they bend apart) and laxus (easily bending, flexible).

Lucha describes how people fought: bending one another with their bodies.

### Why Sex and Fight Share Etymology

In very ancient times (before "love" as we know it today), both sex and fighting involved similar physical movements: grabbing, bending, rough physical engagement.

Sex was not gentle and romantic—it was about reproduction as survival.

So struggle and reproduction were energetically and physically similar: both involved bending, flexibility, and force.

### Struggle: Fixed vs. Flexible

The English word struggle comes from stréo, meaning fixed or standing still.

Struggle equals something so fixed it needs to break.

The difference: Lucha (Latin/Spanish) addresses the problem of being too flexible (bending too much), while Struggle (English) addresses being too rigid (can't bend).

Two perspectives on the same challenge.

### Flexibility: The Key to Survival

The word laxus (flexible, easily bending) is key.

To survive struggle, you must be flexible.

If you're too rigid (struggle), you break. If you're too flexible (lucha), you collapse.

Balance between the two equals strength.

### The Sacral Chakra and Struggle

The sacral chakra governs creativity, reproduction, sexuality, and adaptability.

Struggle lives here because reproduction requires flexibility (bending to create new life), creativity requires flexibility (adapting to new forms), and survival requires flexibility (bending without breaking).

### Struggle in Spiritual Context

Modern spirituality often teaches: "Don't fight," "Let go of struggle," "Be at peace always."

This denies a fundamental life force.

Struggle is natural, necessary, and creative.

The question is not "How do I eliminate struggle?" The question is: "How do I struggle with wisdom?"

### Creative Wisdom

"I Am Creative Wisdom"

Wisdom in struggle means knowing when to be flexible (bend), knowing when to be firm (stand), using the force of struggle to create (not destroy), and fighting for life (reproduction, defense) not for ego.

### Reflection on Beliefs and Struggle

"What is my biggest struggle regarding my beliefs?"

This connects to the root of struggle: What am I defending? (belief system) What am I trying to reproduce? (spread my truth) What territory am I protecting? (my worldview)

Inflection equals bending inward (examining). Reflection equals bending outward (expressing).

The practice asks you to inflect (bend inward to examine your struggle) and reflect (bend outward to express/release it).

This is Lucha—the sacred bending.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Become aware of your breath, body, and space.

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark. Bring this light to your sacral chakra.

### Main Practice

Crown - Beliefs: Think about your biggest struggle regarding your beliefs. Do you fight for them? Defend them? Try to spread them? Inflect (bend inward): Examine this struggle. Reflect (bend outward): Release it to the crown.

Third Eye - Thoughts: What is your biggest struggle regarding your thoughts? Do they bend too much (confusion)? Too little (rigidity)? Inflect and reflect this struggle.

Throat - Truth: What is your biggest struggle regarding your truth? Are you fighting to be heard? Defending against others' truths? Inflect and reflect.

Heart - Feelings: What is your biggest struggle regarding your feelings? Are you defending your heart? Fighting to feel safe? Inflect and reflect.

Solar Plexus - Being: What is your biggest struggle regarding who you are? Are you fighting for identity? Defending your sense of self? Inflect and reflect.

Sacral - Creation: What is your biggest struggle regarding your creativity? Are you fighting to create? Defending your creations? This is the center of struggle—reproduction and creation. Inflect and reflect.

Root - Reality: What is your biggest struggle regarding your reality? Are you fighting for survival? Defending your existence? Inflect and reflect.

Knees - Path: What is your biggest struggle regarding your path? Are you fighting for your direction? Defending your choices? Inflect and reflect.

Ankles - Purpose: What is your biggest struggle regarding your mission? Are you fighting to fulfill it? Defending it from obstacles? Inflect and reflect.

Sound: Ry

I am creative wisdom. I am creative wisdom. I am creative wisdom.

I am. I am. I am.

### Closing

Recognize that struggle is not wrong. Struggle is the force of life fighting to survive, reproduce, and thrive.

The question is not "Do I struggle?" (you do, by nature). The question is: "Do I struggle with wisdom?"

Take a deep breath. Stretch. Yawn. Return here and now at your own time.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Notice where you struggle today. Don't judge it as "not spiritual."

Ask: "What am I defending? What am I trying to create/reproduce? What territory am I protecting?"

Then ask: "Am I too rigid (can't bend) or too flexible (collapsing)?"

Find the balance.

### The Wisdom in Struggle

When you feel yourself fighting for something, pause:

1. Is this defense? (Protecting what I need to survive)
2. Is this reproduction? (Creating/spreading what I value)
3. Is this territory? (Establishing my space in the world)

If yes to any—the struggle is natural and right.

The question becomes: "Am I struggling wisely or reactively?"

### Flexibility Practice

In one area where you're struggling:
- If you're too **rigid**: Practice bending (consider other perspectives, adapt)
- If you're too **flexible**: Practice standing firm (set boundaries, hold your ground)

Wisdom knows when to do which.

## Q&A

### Q: Isn't struggle a sign I'm not aligned spiritually?

No. Struggle is a sign you're **alive**. Every living thing struggles. The question is whether you struggle with wisdom (creative) or reactivity (destructive).

### Q: How is struggle different from suffering?

Struggle is natural effort to survive and thrive. Suffering is resistance to what is. You can struggle without suffering if you accept that struggle is part of life.

### Q: Why does the sacral chakra govern struggle?

Because sacral governs **creation and reproduction**—the two main reasons beings struggle. We fight to create, to reproduce, to bring forth new life.

### Q: What if I'm too flexible and keep collapsing in struggles?

Practice **standing firm**. Set boundaries. Learn when to say "no." Flexibility without structure is collapse.

### Q: What if I'm too rigid and keep breaking in struggles?

Practice **bending**. Consider other perspectives. Adapt. Rigidity without flexibility is brittleness.

### Q: Is all fighting justified as "natural struggle"?

No. Wisdom distinguishes between: (1) Fighting for survival/creation (natural), and (2) Fighting for ego/power over others (destructive). Know the difference.

### Q: How do I know if my struggle is wise or reactive?

Ask: "Am I defending what I truly need? Am I creating something valuable? Am I protecting necessary territory?" If yes, it's wise. If it's just ego protection or power games, it's reactive.
