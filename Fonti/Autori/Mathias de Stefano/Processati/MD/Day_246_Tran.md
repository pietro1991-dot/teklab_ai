## Introduction

Foreign good morning good afternoon good evening to all of you especially you just saw I am holding the computer with a combo with a cup of coffee That's My Style how are we going with our list of questions today which is the Sacrament day of the mental week of Aries the question for today is how today was is the first day I'm alone again because all the people just left went away and my mom too yesterday she kept home she's lying now so I came back to main natural state of being alone which I like as always before we begin let's remember the etymology of the words so remember etymology of the word how how comes from the in the European language meaning the object met is the measure the the way to measure things and then from there in the all English we have hallway Huawei that means how we remember is the world things which gives the origin to y two so for those who are new I remind you that I usually explain the etymology of the words because when we understand from where the things come the words that we usually use come from it helps us not only to know how to use it properly but also to understand the beliefs because the words were created According to some beliefs so it's important to know the etymology to know how also not only the words but also our beliefs and point of views have been created so now for us to get this question remember that means what shape what the shape of these things so this is the right question so this means that the question how is trying to describe the shape of the things the way in which they are shown okay so let's go to the meaning and the concept of the word how so from our cultural point of view of the question how when we say how really refer to the idea of how can I do this or how can I reach this place how the question how is trying to go into the ways in which we can end our project and the ways in which we can accomplish our mission or goals in something particular so it describes the shape that we have to take the modus the the the way in which we have to to do something now picture this structure here we go from point A to point B in our way since we are the letter A we are the subject the subject that has an ID object has an idea and this idea is a projection is projected to an end a final thing yes final thing so project comes from projecta is to throw objecta Pro ahead projecta to throw ahead so idea that is projected to an end to a final destination which is B after we have the object here we have the subject with the idea and the final projection is the object of the idea that's why the idea of the subject is subjective and the object where it goes to is objective the goal this one here is who this one here is what and the way in which the subtitude will achieve the object is called the how it might be like a silly thing what I'm explaining here but is the basis to understand the next things hmm so why this line here is the how because this way here this line here is the shape of the what shape of the what which is the object so this here from point A to point B is a line hmm it's a line to go there is erect so rect is its origin is Latin that gives the word rule sorry ruler hmm the ruler so what is a ruler is an instrument the distance the shape of point A to point B this means that the how is under rules it has rules to follow so a rule a rule a ruler taken as an object is a line a rule take it as a subject is Allo foreign we have here many objects so remember that when I connect all the dots I have a rule from point A to point B so here we have the same structure that we saw before so now when you take only one we take this line here this line is equal to because this line is a way to connect point A to point B hmm now If instead of taking this line A to B I erase the B here and I name this one like the B now the how won't be just one line going from one spot to another so once erase the point B from here and I put it here I will have many ways to reach this so in the moment when this line stops being a rule align a law of the how a way to do it and it becomes a question so in the animation of the universe the point a to reach the point B here it's online is one rule is a law easy it's one way to go to an object but when I take the point B from input it here suddenly the affirmation of the rule changes and we transform a question that is how how can I reach this one meaning what is the New Path this means that we can do this path this way this is one how I can also go in a straight line is another how I can also do this path that's another how this means that there are many paths so many ways so now let's go to remember who does this path do you remember the two kind of who remember we have two ways of asking who one is who like me and the other one is who like the being can you remember from yesterday so what important of importance of am is that reminds me that the being is all this is all of this every line every Dot everything what was the importance of the I am afraid of the me what is the importance of me what is the importance of me me is the one that is the gravity that creates one of these dots without me without I without I this dot cannot exist so it needs the energy of the way of the other ones around in order to exist and create new ones so the I me is important to know at least that it takes that represents within a network and the am is important to remind me that is a part of a whole network so no one of them is bad or good both of them are needed in order to exist so me is the one that we call Eagle the am is the one that we call the Bean thank you so if District ego is a an ego must reach the point B the ego from its perspective will have to go and look for ways to reach foreign a is the subject and B is the object so the ego this being the ego the subject will its life trying to reach the objective the goal it seems complex because I'm explaining it very slow but actually all this in here equals life this is life so we have the subject ego that through its life we'll try to find a goal adaptive and the path the ways that it reaches to accomplish its objective its goal will the how now when I ask the question in my life how can I accomplish accomplish my purpose how can I publish my mission how can I reach my goals how can I get to happiness How can I find the peace how can I find Harmony every time that we ask how is this tiny being from here me the ego asking itself what is the path to get here so that's why every person will ask ourselves how can I do something we do it from the ego because the ego is the one that tries to understand this the ego and the being I and am has interesting foreign attributes the arm is eliminated and the ah is limited if you see blurry just listen to me don't read the arm is infinite the sorry the the m is infinite the I is infinite the m is indeterminated and the I is terminated so this is eliminated because it doesn't have any limits it goes openly to everywhere it keeps going it's infinite because it doesn't have a purpose it's always the same constantly replicating in the shape it doesn't have an end it's endless and is interterminated because it doesn't have terms it keeps going constantly because the am the being is eliminated infinite and indeterminate doesn't have the opportunity to experience one concrete thing it's impossible for it to understand a specific thing so this is why the am creates a being that is limited finite and determinated so in this way the am is able to create the I the ego in order to create and to experience that Creation in only one of the cells of this infinite universe the ego is a tool for the am the universal being and what does stealth the ego it has patterns and loss to accomplish patterns rules and laws so this means that the ego is the Oneness within itself the question how can I accomplish the the things how can I go through all the patterns that I have so the ego is the one asking constantly all the time how project itself from the subject to the object in a projection projection towards the future how can I know which is the goal which is the objective how can I know this is the right path I know how to get there how can I know how to accomplish my mission so the ego is the one protecting itself into another thing asking how can I but the am the being doesn't ask that the being is everything so the question of the being is how am I how am I for the being this all is the same how am I when a person leaves from the ego the questions that it does are always outside when someone is living from the big the question is how am I because it knows that the point a and the point B is oneself the question how am I is the one that helps me to accomplish my mission how am I can help me to understand the tools that I have to accomplish my mission my purpose my goals how am I encodes the idea of all the answers to how was the meaning of how how means the shape of of something literally means that how means the shape of something so basically from the ego point of view the question how is talking about what is the shape that I have to follow in order to reach something from point A to B so the filling the the point of view of am of the being regarding the question how is not only one path it's the whole thing is the shape of something the shape of who I am so that's why for the being when you know the entire shape of yourself what is the way in which I feel what is the way in which I think the way in which I am when I ask myself what is my shape what is my way now I can start to understand the whole pattern the ego what's the question in the future the being that's the question in present and in the question made impressant I figure out the shape of the thing the point a in point B all together here and now and I want to clarify something to Clarity to clarify something about this I am not saying here or judging the ego or the according to this structure okay I'm not saying that I'm saying that this we can understand shape the idea of where we are where where we find ourselves because both are important the ego and the and I is a map is okay so it's not about if I am asking the questions so wrong no don't think that this is normal it's just to picture the whole idea so now once we understand the conceptual idea we have to remember that if we do these questions how can I reach my goal how can I find this how can I do that we are always constantly every day asking ourselves things how to do the things so remember that what we do when we ask ourselves these questions is because we look ourselves as separated from the world when we ask the questions in this way is because we're thinking that everything is apart from us that the things are not connected that I need to know something from the outside in order to what I'm willing to so we start to connect with the essence of our being or we start to look for for the connection to the essence of ourselves the question should be different the question is always how am I so I wrote the example today about myself I was asking completely all the time in my life to do the project I am the questions how can I do it how can I pay for it how can I communicate to the people what I'm doing how can I how can I reach the spot where I have to go how can I organize this trip to 32 nodes of the planet so I was always doing these questions and I was always doing these questions from the ego because I was trying to reach that from the ego and suddenly everything changed when all the ways in which I decided to do it all the house that I was trying to solve were impossible to do the quarantine the lockdown arrived and everything was ended so suddenly I real I realized that I cannot do this path as I was designing on how to do it that this if this path is the I am so the way of doing it is being myself I am so instead of going to the future to question myself how to do it I did the question in the present on how I am and I started to do it in my way the way in which I was able to do this project was by just being me by taking the tools of my personality the tools that I have with me what I am doing it just being myself and that's how everything worked I'm doing it because of I am doing it as I am I saw the entire picture of who I was and there were all the answers remember the question how is describing the shape of what it is when the question how is done by the ego everything will be always a projection of an idea when the question is done by the am by the self the B the subject and the object becomes the same thing and you become a goal your own objection objective foreign so that would be and now I'm sweating the vibration for today is the statement for today is I am the Creator's vision the code for today is Hercules the Great Hero remembered by everyone that had to fulfill the 12 worst cast of the ancient world to show that he was see his son and that he deserved a place with the Gods its path is the path of Enlightenment and this he is the guide to those who find themselves going through the great tests of life let's go to the
