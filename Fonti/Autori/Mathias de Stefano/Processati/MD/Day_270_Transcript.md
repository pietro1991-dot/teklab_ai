## Introduction

Well , welcome to everybody to the last day of the month of areas , which is exactly nine months from the beginning of this path.

So , it 's been nine months since we begin.

So , it 's a perfect cycle. And so , in all these times , we did n't have any weekend , any holidays , no day out.

So , we 've been straight nine months till today.

So , thank you to all of you who have been every day here with me and thank you to all those who have been joining me in the next months and weeks. And we have three months more ahead to finish this.

So , let 's keep doing it.

So , for the closure of this month , the day of tourists , I 'm sorry , the day of the of the thought right. We will talk about the topic of free will. I 've been reading the post just right now , tried to understand a little bit what I was supposed to explain right now. And it 's really , I know that some concepts are really complicated.

I would recommend you to read it once and again , once and again , until you get kind of the idea. I was trying to make a summary of the concepts. And I know that topics are complex sometimes , but those are the ways in which I 've found to explain it today.

So , I was just saying , do we have free will? No , we do n't have.

So , that 's it.

So , have a good night. See you later in the next moment. Let 's go to deeper into into this. Actually , we do n't have free will.

## Practice Structure

And this is something that is really heavy to get for some people because we have put so much of expectation and weight into the concept of free will that we kind of expect for us to be free in the universe to have this freedom. But we actually do n't have free will in the universe. But what we do have is the possibility of create free will. And that 's what we are going to work with today.

The idea of free will is something that philosophical was born in the religious way of thinking , in which we started to build the idea that we are free to make a choice in our life. That we can do any choice in our reality.

So , for example , like in the matrix movie , we have the red and the blue pill and we have to choose one of it , one of them.

So , in the movie , they tell you you have to pick one and your path will be determined by what you pick. Well , now take that into the next level. Like related to people , you have to choose in between to people or to projects or to path or to careers. Whatever you have to pick in between two things or more , is the concept is that you are free to do so.

But you have the free will to choose that.

Remember , that will comes from the concept of world in the European languages , which means to desire something , to be to want something.

So , when we say to the free will is the freedom of choice upon something that I want this and I am free to choose this.

Okay , so that 's the will. This idea then is the one take us to today to the concept that we have this ability to choose in between different things. According to what we want or desire in our life. First of all , to understand why we say freedom , free of will.

We have to understand what is that this concept of free will is related to the way in which humans perceive freedom , not how it actually is. Freedom from the point of view of humans is when you set yourself free from the relationship with others , with the links with others. Like when you are oppressed by something , so you release the pressure.

So , you go into another path , into another way , with another people.

So , we could picture this like , if we have these humans here and all are acted so kind of oppressed. And this one here says , I do n't want to be like that. I do n't want to be oppressed by these other links.

So , I want to be with this one here.

So , it connects with this one and breaks with this other set in itself free from the other group.

So , in the concept of human , in the concept of our point of view , that ourselves free is basically to change a group and go into another one , which is something obvious for us , but it 's not like this for the entire universe. Let 's imagine this. We have this structure here. We have here oxygen , oh , and to hydrogen.

So , it 's two ions and one oxygen , H2O. We all know what is this. This is water.

So , what would happen if then here says , no , I do n't want to be part of this anymore. I have the free will to choose to go here. What happened with this structure?

So , what happened here? When this one here says , I do n't want to be part of this anymore and go so suddenly it 's not to He. It 's H2O. Suddenly it 's just that.

It 's not water anymore. In the universe , the organization like this is not like because simply happened. It is organized by resonance , by resonance. And the resonance we can understand it as electrical charge , whether it 's positive or negative.

So , by resonance , particles get together to create an atom. By resonance , these particles get together to create an atom and atoms. By resonance , get to create a molecule and a molecule. By resonance , get together to create a chemical and so on.

By resonance. They do n't do this by wheel.

So , what this means that in the microcosmos and the microcosmos , all things are attracted by resonance , not by wheel. I will try to explain this.

So , what would make then for you to choose in between one of the other? The thing that makes you choose between one or other is not free will. It 's the interpretation of your brain , which is evolving according to interpretive the wavelength of the photon that moves through the life reflecting this object into your brain and the brain interprets that data and according by resonance in that wavelength , to be much more attracted to one color or the other. Just because your brain is designed better than one or another.

So , this is like killing the magic.

Sorry , but so.

Now let 's humanity this. This interpretation.

The reason why we choose one or another because of the brain interprets , oh , this one I know is because , along my history , since the moment I was born , everything that happened to me was related to some color. For example , every time was happy or every time that something good happened or something romantic happened or something a laughter happened , my brain usually saw something that was blue.

So , because I was watching something blue around when things were going fine , my brain was seemed to interpretive that when I see blue things can come better. Things would be fine. And that 's why when I have to choose something , I would pick the blue one because my brain says it would be fine.

So , actually this is like send it to hell , free. We can tell that with a person. For example , with a person , we also in which choose someone that we like , that we love. When we have to pick someone apart in our lives , we will usually try to pick a person to do that.

That reminds us the first laughter , the first structures of the face of mom or dad or someone that we loved a lot when we were born. Because the brain says this is good. And that 's why we usually pick people. There are similar to our family.

So , the same thing happened when we choose a place to go to on holidays , if it 's called hot or cold , if it 's a place that is order or a place that is mess. And even when you had an election when you have to vote , socialism or conservatism , the blue ones , the red ones. Actually , our brain is designed. Our human brain is designed in order to capture information , to receive data and receive information all the time.

So , before we , we were born , we started to capture all these data through the sentence by the voices , the touch , the smells , the colors , the situations around everything. And in the first seven years of your life , your brain has designed the entire structure that will determine your choices for the next 80 years.

So , now we go a bit more complex because I was just about an individual. A unique being , only one human being. The thing is that when you start to think bigger , you remember that your body is a constant reproduction of cells that has the information of the entire history of the human being , not only grandfathers and grandmothers , then tire cells of human beings to the origin of our history , millions of years ago.

So , we have within the conditions of fear , of hunger , I do n't know , many , many data that we do n't even know about , that is conditioning every day what we do , what we choose. And now let 's think even much more bigger. Human beings are inside the homicide branches. The homicide are in the mammal branches.

The mammals come from other vertebrae beings that connect us with the birds and the reptilians , the reptiles. And then we go to the oceans connected to the fishes. And then we start to remember that under the Bra , how to say this in English , without vertebrae , without bones , beings.

So , from them we reach the amoeba and from the amoeba , we reach the first cell. And the first cells we reach the conjunction of chemicals that creates an organism , or starting.

So , all of that information from all those history is connected to ourselves , the turning , what we are , what we choose every day.

So , going back in the time , this chemicals came from disguise , through asteroids , comets , that came from other worlds , other planets , even in other galaxies.

So , we have also the memory of others ' relations , of other beings in different stars , all that that are within us. And of course , some aliens that came in between.

So , everything that we are , everything that exists in ourselves , in everything that we can touch here , basically came from the interaction of a network of particles that are together by resonance.

So , where this is taken us to , to what we spoke yesterday , when we said everything that exists , is just a network of data information. And what is the word that makes a summary of a network of data information? The word is mind.

So , where this is taken us to , that in the origin of everything , when this first wave become a particle and starts to exchange data , everything that comes after that is a constant condition , is a constant projection that is conditioned by this data.

So , basically , everything that exists is just an idea , connected through or expressed through time and space.

So , this helps us to understand something that we have to take out of our minds , which is that we have not been created by the universe online. We humans , existence , have been , have n't been , we were not created by the universe. We are the mind. We are data manifested.

So , the mistake that we usually do is that we want to put a name a who to that interaction of data in the mind. When the word who is basically another projection of the expansion of this network.

So , this is why we are manifested data. Manifested information. We were not created by the mind. We are the mind.

If we are information , it means that we are mind and the mind is this network that is exchanging data all the time , which means that we are conditioned by data.

So , we do n't have freedom. And here I want to go deep into this concept of freedom. Because when I say we have not freedom in the universe , suddenly we start to think that , oh , so we are not free. We have to break something , set ourselves free from this oppression of the universe because we are not free.

But that 's a human vision. Humans have been trying to escape from oppression through history. It 's not. But in all this explanation that I did , I never said someone , I never said that the universe is someone that has ourselves in a place.

So , from who? We have to be free from. If there is no who.

So , the idea of freedom is not to escape from one spot. The idea of be free is to recognize that I am that spot.

So , the idea of how we can set ourselves free is when we recognize that all this network of data , all this entangled links of information is ourselves. And those things are the ones that are conditioned , conditioning us in what we are. This is us , is ourselves. It 's everywhere.

So , when we recognize that we are that entanglement of data.

So , we recognize that we are oppressed by ourselves , not by something outside. And there is no network outside or inside that is expressing us. Because in the universe , everything is a constant. The fertilization of the mind.

So , we are consequence. This is why we do have free will. Because when I am willing something , it means that I wish for something that I need for something that I want something.

So , if I want something , this is connected to all the codes and the data that programmed me in order to survive by saying this food is the right one , this person is the right one , this path is the right one.

So , I am willing to take that food because is a good one. I am willing to relate with this person because it is the wood one.

So , the wheel is kind of the intention that is moved by the data that conforms myself , that shape myself.

## Q&A

So , the question here is , Am I able to have free will? Well , yes , we can. But first of all , we have to understand that all the choices we are already taken. Why?

Because the choices are not made by us , are made by the network of data that create us that we are.

So , this means that all the choices have been made in the time in the moment when I was designed as what I am now.

So , all the choices have been taken. The only thing that I am doing here is to figure out how to leave that choice.

So , the choices that I made in my structure of information and structure of data , the choices that I did , are taking me to have a will that is condition. We are conditioning our will according to what we know from the world that we felt from the world through all this collection of data. As I did example , the red , I will relate red with something wrong. For example , according to if my brain have lived experience acknowledging that the situations where the red was present were not good for me.

Or for example , and of course , that data will create an emotion-regard the red.

So , then my will according to the red color will be determined , but what I know from the red and what I just from the red. You got that because that 's important.

So , we are determined conditioned in our choice of will or will of choice. By the emotions that we have that our structure of data feels and the knowledge that was storageing as data. It means that before , when we have before , is that the structure that I am is conditioned by a knowledge that is conditioned and a feeling that is conditioned by the experiences that will determine and conditioned my will.

So , we have three kind of conditions here. The condition of what I know , which is the condition of wisdom , the condition of what I felt , which is the condition of love and the condition of what I will , I am willing to do , which is conditioned by I think , I know and what I feel. If I am willing to set myself free and have free will , what I have to do is get out of the conditions of will.

So , I need to become unconditional in my will and the way I can only do it is if I become unconditionally loving and additional wisdom. You got that because this is important. For you to see it , what we have here is that if I am vibrating low , I will attract things that are also vibrating low. By resonance , I will attract the same things that I have.

So , I connect to that and when I do that , we 'll have the same level of vibration.

Okay , so that creates an knowledge and experience from that vibration , that creates a wave of energy that we call love and the love , the feeling , will be conditioned by that acceptance that will take me to have action to take action in my life in my will.

So , according to that level of vibration , this is why our will is conditioned by what we feel and where we know which is exchange of data. In order to have free will , what we have to do is to set ourselves free from the conditions of that will.

So , we have to become to take for ourselves and conditional will. And the way we can reach and conditional will is if we look into our relationships and our emotions and we start to heal our connections and how we feel the world and the others ourselves. And we start to transform into unconditional love. And that takes us to the path of information which is our beliefs , our patterns of action.

I have this faith or I have a belief and nobody can change it.

So , that 's wisdom that is conditioned by our experience. But if we open ourselves to the world to learn new things , to allow ourselves to change our point of view or amplify our point of view , we will be living through unconditional wisdom. If we free ourselves from the attachments and the conditions of love , we start to live through unconditional love. And the two , conditional wisdom and love , will take me to set myself free from all the previous conditions that takes me to action.

So , my next action will be free. This is why , this is why unconditional will or free will is not a universal love. If something that we built up , the key here is not unconditional love. The key here is unconditional in every sense , because the universal mind which is the connection of data is conditioned by resonance.

So , the answer is no , we do n't have free will. Unless we become beings that are completely unconditional. Just to wrap this , it 's not a must that we have to be have free will. It 's not something that you have to to work for having it because you must have it.

No , this is the choice , okay , in your path that I went to work with the free will in myself. For example , I am rising capricorn. I do n't warm free will. It would be really uncomfortable for me to have free will.

I would n't be here. I need myself not to be free in that will in order to accomplish everything that I 'm doing.

So , I am feel that , okay , I know the stages , I know what to do.

So , it 's not a must. It 's just that.

So , when the reason why it 's not a must is because , for example , when you start to be connected to the net , the lies that you are the net , the web , is you do n't feel any more like you are oppressed or you are not free , because you are.

So , you simply say , I am , I am the network. That 's it.

## Daily Practice Elements

So , information for today , the statement for today is I am the eternal designer. The code is South America. The second American continent on the path to ascension is the expression of the universal third eye chara that manifests in South America played in two priorities , the inner dream and the vision and external purpose. This manifests in the contention of life and its gestation on the great Amazon rainforest.

When adverse the Andes Mountains elevate its lands were the last one on being populated and therefore , the ones that mark the future possibilities. This is the last day with the music for tomorrow.

So , moreover , we begin with a new one.

## Guided Meditation

So , thank you to Gig and his brother and the people that help him to do the music for our path. I become aware of the space that is surrounding the body that I inhabit on my own breathing. And on their my feet , I have served the light of the consciousness of my body in the shape of a divine spark. I breathe , and take an eye to it.

I ascend this divine spark to my feet. I have no eyes. The sacred legs of my feet initiating this inishatic path along my inner being. And I set the intention of the hypnotic condition of him and his feet.

I breathe on the night when feet. I ascend this divine spark to my knees. I ascend this divine spark to my feet. I am very recognized in the connection of the feminine and the masculine human history.

I set the intention to be an unconditional in my future. I breathe in the night my knees. I ascend this divine spark to my genitals. And I recognize in it the vital energy , the lake of the criminality.

And I set the intention to be unconditional in my will. I breathe in the night when genitals. And rise up , this spark to my creative center in the scrum. I recognize in it the temple of the mother of creation in between the lights and the darkness.

And I set the intention of being unconditional with my creations. I breathe and ignite my scrum. I ascend this spark to the inner night towards my plexus. And I recognize the temple of the body in my attributes.

I set the intention to be unconditional with every one of my relationships. I breathe and ignite my plexus. I ascend this divine spark to my heart. And I recognize in it the temples of life and love irredigging to the world.

And I set the intention to love and conditional. I breathe and ignite my heart. I ascend this spark to my throat chapter. I observe with them the temple of the sun with the rays of truth all over the world.

And I then attention to be unconditional in every truth and everyism and breathe and ignite my throat. I take a breath and ascend this divine spark to my third eye. And I contemplate in front of me the eyes of the sins of serving inside of me. I am conditioned to be unconditional in my wisdom.

## Energy Work

I have served how the inner nine opens itself in a beautiful , beautiful , and shining surrounded the crown of parents. I set intention to be eternally unconditional. I take a deep breath and ignite my heart. And I observe all the sparks that we have been working with all along this non-expanding crown towards my feet , creating this beautiful torus ignite my fire.

And I ignite the free will in me. I am eternal , the signer. I am the signer. I take a deep breath just to massage and carry this body coming back here and now slowly.

Thank you everybody for having a company for another month in this path. And as always , see you tomorrow at the same time. And this time to begin with the month of torus. Bye.
