## Overview

Day 32 marks the beginning of the Mental Week within the Virgo constellation, a ten-day cycle dedicated to bringing order and consciousness to the mind's intricate workings. This month-long journey through Virgo (September 3 - October 2, 2020) asks us to become analytical observers of our inner world, writing down lists, organizing thoughts, and examining the building blocks of our personality with meticulous care. Today's focus on **qualities** represents the second layer of this mental architecture, following the work on beliefs from Day 31.

The Virgo month operates like a teacher giving homework every single day, without weekends or holidays. This demanding structure reflects Virgo's essence: detailed work, analytical precision, and the willingness to examine even the smallest components of who we are. For those who resist making lists or doing concrete tasks, this resistance itself becomes valuable information. Perhaps childhood traumas around schoolwork, or a more fluid, imaginative nature that chafes against structure, reveals where we need balance. The list-writing practice isn't punishment—it's a tool for vocalization, attention, and making the abstract concrete.

Qualities differ fundamentally from beliefs. While beliefs represent what we expect reality to be, qualities are the **tools** we inherited from those beliefs. Qualities are attributes of our personality that exist whether we actively use them or not—they are things others see in us, things we've carried since birth, not skills learned through life. These qualities can be positive (helping us and others) or negative (helping us but not others), and they can be awakened (actively expressed) or sleeping (dormant potentials we haven't yet accessed).

Today's work with the Third Eye chakra illuminates this landscape of qualities. The Third Eye is the center that awakens and sleeps, the place where consciousness becomes aware or remains dormant. By activating the vibration **Nae** and embracing the statement "I Am Emissary of Consciousness," we bring light to these tools of our personality. The task is simple yet profound: write down your qualities without shame or false modesty. Recognize both your gifts and your limitations, for both are tools that shape how you navigate reality and serve the world.

## Core Teaching

### Understanding Qualities Versus Beliefs

The whole month of Virgo serves as a kind of classroom where we receive homework assignments daily. This might create conflict for many people, especially those who carry trauma from childhood schooling experiences. When we were children, teachers pushed us to write down words, correct our mistakes by repetition, make lists—all tasks that may have felt forced, done for others rather than ourselves. This creates a resistance to structured work that carries into adulthood.

The homework given in this course, however, is fundamentally different. This is work for yourself, not for external validation. If you don't want to do it, you simply don't. There is no exam, no judgment, no grade. The purpose of writing things down is to vocalize, to place your attention precisely, and to make abstract thoughts physical and concrete. Otherwise, your mind just flies away, wandering without anchor. When you write it down, the thought becomes real—you can return to it, check it again, examine it.

The resistance to doing concrete tasks like making lists often comes from being more mentally oriented, more imaginative and fluid. For analytical people who naturally love order, list-making calms the mind. But for those who fly freely in their thoughts, this structure feels constraining. Recognize that in the Virgo month dedicated to imagination (later in the year), analytical people will find that work challenging. Each of us has different strengths and weaknesses. The point of this work is to acknowledge where we need balance and to put order in our lives.

When we want to organize our lives, we must write things down. Organization requires externalizing the chaos, placing each issue in its proper place. This is for our own order, our own clarity—not for anyone else.

### The Difficulty of Identifying Beliefs and Qualities

Many people report difficulty writing down their beliefs. They think, "I have many beliefs in my life," but when asked to actually list them, the brain seems to freeze. "Wait—what ARE my beliefs? What do I actually believe?" This difficulty reveals something important: beliefs are the essence of who we are, and the body tries to protect that essence like it protects blood.

The blood is necessary to stay alive, so the body holds it inside. Similarly, beliefs are like the blood of the mind—the fundamental substance that makes us who we are. When we try to externalize beliefs by writing them down, the mind instinctively protects itself. This is why it feels so difficult. We're being asked to examine the very foundation of our existence.

Remember that we're not yet being asked to transform beliefs. We're simply trying to understand what they are. Is a belief positive (pushing us forward, helping us express and expand) or negative (pulling us back, limiting ourselves)? For example, a positive belief might be: "I believe I was sent by someone in the universe to change things, to help planet Earth, to have a purpose." Whether this happens or not is different—that's still a belief. It helps us move forward and do things for the world.

From the same energetic reality—the universe expressing vibrations through atoms and molecules—we could form a negative belief: "Nothing I know from the universe is real. It's just translated into my own perceptions. I'm just a formation of molecules. I don't have worth. I have nothing to give. I don't matter. Nothing I do is important. I'm useless." This belief, seen from the same biological or physical aspect of the universe, creates a completely different reality.

The crucial understanding is this: **none of our beliefs are actually true**. Not one. Beliefs are perceptions that give meaning and understanding to why we exist and what we're doing. They're not objective truth—they're tools for creating meaning.

### Virgo's Work: Organization Without Judgment

We're working with Virgo energy, which is not concerned with finding the ultimate meaning of life. Virgo doesn't ask existential questions like "What is the purpose of everything?" That's work for Scorpio. Virgo simply says: "I have all this mess. How do I organize all these parts?" For Virgo, it doesn't matter if beliefs are real or if anything has ultimate meaning. Virgo's question is: "Let's put order in life. Let's not do existential questions right now."

Beliefs won't tell us the ultimate truth. They're only perceptions of truth. We're not looking for absolute truth in this work. The only way to reach understanding of truth is through examining the tools we have. We must understand our tools in order to picture what truth might be.

The task given throughout this month isn't just for these few days—it's for our whole life. We move from one belief to another constantly. If we cannot acknowledge each of the tiny things that form us and have shaped us through life, we will never be able to find truth in ourselves, to understand it, to handle it. That's what brings us to today's focus.

### Qualities: The Tools of Our Beliefs

The Crown chakra is all about beliefs. The Third Eye chakra is about qualities. The Third Eye is a chakra that goes to sleep and awakens—it operates in cycles of dormancy and activation. Qualities can also be called abilities, characteristics, capacities, or attributes. These are things we can have—qualities, abilities, characteristics we possess.

We can have these attributes, these qualities, these abilities either awakened or sleeping. The qualities or capacities are not related to what we know how to do—not related to skills like finding things, painting well, or performing tasks. Qualities above all are related to things our personality has. It's not about what we can materialize or do; it's about what we ARE in our personality. These are things that simply exist in us.

People can notice these qualities by just watching us. It's not about knowledge from outside sources like astrology (though astrology can help). We're talking about the qualities we know we have within, that we express even if we don't understand them consciously. Usually, qualities are things that others see in us and tell us about: "You are kind," "You are patient," "You are creative." These are observations others make.

Most of us are really ashamed to say or acknowledge the qualities we have. We think it would be selfish to state our own positive qualities. But recognizing qualities is not being selfish—it's realizing, "As I have beliefs, I also have qualities."

### Positive and Negative Qualities

We have qualities that are positive and qualities that are negative. We have qualities that are awakened (qualities we actively have and use) and qualities that are sleeping (qualities we don't have active). The qualities we have are the ones we share with others. The qualities we don't have are those we admire in others—we're drawn to them because they represent dormant potentials within ourselves.

Positive qualities are those that help us, nourish us, AND help others, nourishing them as well. Negative qualities are those that help us but don't help others—or may even harm the collective good while benefiting ourselves.

Matias shares personal examples. As a positive quality, he recognizes he has a gift for communication and education. He believes he's a good teacher. (He acknowledges that some people might say, "No, you explain yourself terribly, I don't understand anything," but he still believes this is one of his positive qualities.) As a negative quality, he recognizes he has a lack of empathy. Sometimes it's very difficult for him to feel another person's pain. He doesn't understand it. When he looks at someone suffering, he can hug them and put energy into them, but internally he's thinking, "Wow, I would love to have that capacity for deep feeling."

These are just two examples. Each person is different, and individual examples won't fit everyone. That's why Matias shares his own—you must find yours.

### Qualities Are Inherent, Not Learned

Remember: qualities are not things we learned in life. They are things we've had within ourselves since we were born. For example, explaining, teaching, making speeches—Matias did this since he was a child. Nobody taught him to make speeches, to talk, to teach. That's something in his soul. It's not a quality acquired through life; it's a quality he's carried from birth.

Each person must work with qualities at their own time. When you feel like "I can't do it, I don't know how to write, I can't do this," then take the double effort to write down your list. Maybe stay one hour, go back again, try again. For some people—like those with strong Cancer placements—it might take even a month trying to complete the list. They'll meditate, cry a bit, process slowly. For Aries people, they'll make a long list in five minutes and immediately ask, "What's next?"

Each person at their own time. Remember that qualities are attributes of our personality. What we're doing is trying to understand each part of our personality to understand who we are.

### Qualities as Tools of Beliefs

To summarize the relationship: **Beliefs are what we expect reality to be. Qualities are the tools we inherit from those beliefs.** Beliefs push us to do things in our life. Qualities are the tools we have to achieve those things.

After all, when someone tells us, "What you're saying is not true," we can respond, "Yes, I know. But my truth is helping me." This acknowledgment that beliefs aren't objectively true but serve a purpose brings us full circle to understanding the tools—the qualities—that make those beliefs actionable.

## Practice

### Preparation

Find a comfortable seated position. Begin by massaging your body, caressing it gently. Yawn, stretch your limbs. Honor and thank your physical body for being the anchor of the spiritual in matter. Let the weight of your body settle downward as you focus on your breathing. Relax completely.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Third Eye

1. **Breathe deeply.** Bring oxygen through your nose into your lungs, heart, blood, organs, and muscles. As you breathe in, feel the heat within yourself—the temperature you carry. Notice how it moves through your skin, filling up your aura, expanding outward in all directions.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Become aware that the same energy within you that goes outward is connected with the I Am above your head. With your imagination, bring all the energy around you toward your head, filling up that greater, brightest light over you.

3. **Draw the I Am inward.** Feel and perceive the I Am coming inside your body through your crown chakra. Feel your crown made up of all your beliefs.

4. **Activate the Third Eye.** Take a deep breath and bring the light of the I Am to the core of your head, to your third eye. Recognize that in this center lie all your potentialities—the ones projected into the outside world, all the projections and perceptions the outside world has of you.

5. **Recognize consciousness.** Acknowledge that here in the Third Eye is where your consciousness awakens or sleeps. This is the center of your personality. Ask yourself: "Who am I for myself? Who am I for the world?"

6. **Pronounce the vibration.** Begin to sound: **Nae... Nae... Nae...** As you activate all your qualities with this vibration, take a moment to realize that each one of the qualities creates your personality. Some are awakened, some are asleep. These are the tools that help you realize who you are. Recognize them. Pronounce your qualities—the first that comes to your mind. Say to yourself: "I am... I am... I am..." Recognize and activate them with your sound: **Nae... Nae...**

7. **Expand the light.** As you pronounce the sound Nae, allow the light of the Third Eye to expand, bringing light and clarity to make up your qualities. Recognize that each one of them makes you who you are—these qualities help you understand in what aspects you are aware, you are conscious.

8. **Embody the statement.** Activate by recognizing: "I am the Emissary of Consciousness. I am the Emissary of Consciousness. I am the Emissary of Consciousness. I am the Emissary of Consciousness."

### Closing

Take a deep breath. As you take your hands to your heart, recognize: "I am capable to analyze my qualities. By understanding them, I become aware, conscious."

Say to yourself: "I am the Emissary of Consciousness."

Softly, take the awareness from your heart to all your body. Caress, stretch, yawn. Come back to the present moment. When you're ready, gently open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write down a list of your qualities—both positive and negative. Don't be ashamed and don't think you're being selfish. Be sincere with yourself about the positive qualities you recognize in yourself and the negative qualities you acknowledge.

Include:
- **Positive qualities:** Those that help you AND help others
- **Negative qualities:** Those that help you but don't help others (or may even harm the collective)
- **Awakened qualities:** Those you actively express and share with the world
- **Sleeping qualities:** Those you admire in others (often reflecting dormant potentials within you)

Remember, these are personality attributes you've had since birth, not skills learned through life. Take your time—some people will complete this in five minutes, others might need days or weeks to identify and write them down.

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice when others comment on your qualities. Instead of deflecting compliments with false modesty ("Oh, I'm not really that good at this"), practice receiving the observation: "Thank you for seeing that in me." This is not arrogance—it's consciousness.

Similarly, when you notice yourself admiring a quality in someone else—their patience, their creativity, their strength—recognize that you're seeing a sleeping quality within yourself. The things we admire most intensely often point to our own dormant potentials.

As you move through the Virgo month, keep returning to this list. Add to it. Refine it. The work isn't to change these qualities immediately—it's simply to become conscious of the tools you have. In Matias's words: "We have to understand the tools in order to picture the truth."

## Q&A

### Q: Why is making lists so important in the Virgo month?

Making lists transforms abstract mental concepts into concrete, physical reality. When you write something down, you vocalize it, you place your attention on it precisely, and you make it real. Otherwise, your mind just flies away—thoughts come and go without being examined. The list allows you to return, check again, and actually work with the material. For Virgo energy, which is all about organization and bringing order to chaos, the physical act of list-making is the primary tool.

### Q: What if I have trauma around doing lists or homework from childhood?

Recognize that the trauma usually came from being forced to do tasks for others—for teachers, for grades, for external approval. The lists in this course are entirely for yourself. There's no exam, no judgment, no one checking your work. If you don't want to do it, you simply don't. This isn't school. But understand that if you want to put order in your life, you need some tool to organize the chaos. List-making is simply a practical tool, not a punishment.

### Q: How can I tell the difference between beliefs and qualities?

Beliefs are what you expect reality to be—your perceptions and interpretations of how things are or should be. Qualities are the tools you inherited from those beliefs—the actual attributes of your personality that you express. For example, "I believe the universe is fundamentally loving" is a belief. "I am compassionate and nurturing" would be qualities that arise from that belief. Beliefs are the foundation; qualities are the structure built on that foundation.

### Q: What if I can't figure out if a quality is positive or negative?

At first, just make a neutral list of your qualities without judgment. Then, by thinking about them, differentiate each one by trying to understand which is positive and which is negative. The distinction is simple: Does this quality help me AND help others? That's positive. Does this quality help me but not help others (or potentially harm the collective)? That's negative. Remember, "negative" doesn't mean "bad"—it just means the energy moves in a different direction.

### Q: Why are we not trying to change our beliefs or qualities yet?

This entire month is Virgo work—analysis, organization, examination. We're not in transformation mode; we're in understanding mode. You can't effectively change something you don't fully understand. By the end of the month, after examining beliefs, qualities, truths, attachments, and all the other components, you'll have a clear map of your inner landscape. Then—in future months—you can work on transformation. For now: observe, write down, recognize. No judgment, no rush to fix anything.

### Q: What's the difference between awakened and sleeping qualities?

Awakened qualities are those you actively express and that others can see in you. They're operational right now. Sleeping qualities are potentials that exist within you but haven't been activated yet. Often, the qualities you most admire in other people point to your own sleeping qualities—you recognize them because they exist dormant within you. Both awakened and sleeping qualities are part of who you are; they're just in different states of activation.

### Q: How do I know if something is a quality I was born with versus a skill I learned?

Ask yourself: Have I done this since I was a child, before anyone taught me? Did it come naturally, even when I was very young? For example, Matias recognized his teaching ability because he made speeches and explained things since childhood—nobody taught him that. Learned skills are acquired through education and practice. Inherent qualities are things your soul brought with it, things that were always there even if they developed over time.

### Q: I'm worried about being selfish or arrogant if I acknowledge my positive qualities. How do I work with this?

This concern itself reveals cultural conditioning. We've been taught that recognizing our own gifts is somehow wrong or egotistical. But consciousness requires honest self-assessment. Recognizing qualities is not being selfish—it's simply being accurate. You're not claiming to be better than others; you're acknowledging the specific tools you have to work with. Someone else has different tools. When you deny your qualities out of false modesty, you're actually being unconscious, not humble.
