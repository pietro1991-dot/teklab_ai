## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you and a happy portal day 11 , 11.

## Energy Work

So first of all , I would like to remind you that every day is a portal , not just today. Every day is a portal because a portal means to go from one point to another to go through something.

So every day is a portal because you go through day to night , so it 's basically a portal. But this day 11 , 11 is a code that reminds us by 11 that we are one of serving the other one , which is ourselves. And when we repeat it , it 's a master code that reminds us that we are in the path to reconnect with the self-reunit.

So another thing to explain from this day is that it 's not about the day , it 's about the code. For sure , we have heard that the calendar that we have , the Gregorian calendar , does n't work because it 's not aligned with the moon , it 's not aligned with the sun , basically we 're telling there is not aligned with anything.

So there is people that may say , oh , but I do n't know why we are honoring this day , if it 's not aligned with anything. Well , because of that , it 's because of the code. It 's not because of something astronomical or astrological , it 's because of the code. When we see 11 , 11 is something that a lot of humans in the same day see the pattern 11 , 11.

And because we are all connected in a network being the neurons of the planet.

So when we all see that code is like if thought in the whole humanity starts to work like , who , there 's something different , something weird , okay.

So that 's why it 's an important day. It 's because of the code , not because of what happened in this guy 's.

So another important thing is that today is how for day 100 in the alignments that we are doing.

So it 's been 100 days doing this a lot.

So we accomplished that and precisely in the day 11 and 11.

So it 's very important and it seems like it was all prepared , but no , it was n't. We had no idea that 11 11 would be the 100.

So it 's perfect. Everything is perfect.

Another thing is that if this is 100.

So we have been doing around 200 hours of alignment to now.

So that 's a lot , I guess.

So another thing that we have today is that today our day is the tourist , the foreword.

So we are closing the week of the mind.

So it 's perfect that the whole thing is aligned with the , with the sororoidal day. Perfect.

So another important thing to remember is that if you have seen my social media.

So today we also remembered the two main gatherings that we did in 11 11 , which were the ones helping me to do what I 'm now. And also they were the ones helping me to connect with all of you. Because the first one in November 11 , 2011 , was the moment when I was able to co-everyone , and discover that the network was there , that all of us were there , that the only thing that we have to do was to call for it , to call for , for everyone to be connected.

So it was amazing on the second one , seven years after that because it was the subtenial. We did it in November 11 , 2018. The power of that gathering was to reactivated the project of the connection of the greed , the plans are agreed. And the network , the , the , the , the second geometry of the planet through the project , I am.

So here we are doing what we have received in that gathering.

So it 's perfect. And also the information that we are going to talk about is the reflexes and reflexes is basically that 11 11 is a reflection.

So everything is aligned for today. I 'll in y'all.

So everything is perfectly aligned.

So we have everything ready to connect. About , , about yesterday , I do n't exactly remember what he said , but I guess that kind of idea was that , he was from the sixth dimension. He was from the sixth dimension.

So , , his energy is very different from , from here , but he 's connected with the third dimension. Because six and three are connected.

Okay.

So that would be. And , , so he was trying to explain us from the sixth dimension that everything , the reality is basically like a clock.

So , , it has like this wheels like , like this. And , , so this means that a specific moment that are like the o'clock time.

Okay.

So , it 's like , , for example , the little hands of the clock , the one for the seconds , the one for the minutes , the one for the hour. Imagine this three little hands are like , , the body , the soul and the mind and the spirit.

So when it 's coming in time , like tick-tuck , to start another one , , to start a little bit more. , to start a new one.

So you have to be aligned. The three of them have to be aligned.

So you can start.

So we have to acknowledge that because it 's not like a game for them. And that point of view is like , all the clock.

So there are energies , very much , , strong and hard because , , they are very strict. The things are like this.

So when they say , you have to be aligned for a specific moment , you better do so , because it 's like the moment.

Okay.

So , so that 's why , , in some other dimensions , we can perceive everything like a game. But in some other one , in some other dimensions , they do n't.

So it 's more accurate.

So we have to respect that if we are working with everyone. Oh , another thing , , that she that he said was , , stop thinking , stop thinking , because to see the tick-tuck , you have to feel. You have to perceive it.

So if you 're thinking about how , why , when and all these things , so you 're not going to feel it. You have to perceive that. That is the only way by feeling by receiving. Another important thing that that he said is that it does n't matter if we do n't know everything that we are supposed to.

The important thing is to set the intention. If we set the intention for them , they will perceive it anyway , because it 's like an ocean.

So it 's moving forward with intention. I ca n't do anything with my signal. My signal is like a fine here.

So if you have any problem watching me or listening to me , maybe it 's your signal , because for most of the people , they are saying they 're , they see and hear fine. And another thing from my point of view , yesterday I was the one connected with the highest , with this part of me from the six dimension.

So I just wanted to clarify something in case you may miss on the student me. When I said , I do n't care about you. I could be doing other things. But I am here doing this because I want to work for Eric and blah , blah , blah.

That 's a part of the truth , of course , because from the six dimension , humans are basically systems that we use.

So from the point of view of the six dimension , it 's like this is like , oh , it 's not about you , it 's about something else. You 're just tools.

So that 's very from the six dimension.

So I hope you did n't misunderstand me.

So it 's just that. Maybe maybe it could seem like ego , or that when I speak like this. But it 's not about the ego. It 's about from where I 'm speaking , independent on the dimension.

It seems like ego because we are used to talk like friends and like humans and so on. When we speak from another point of view , they do n't see the emotions and the relations that we have here , the third dimension , it 's different , it 's from another point of view.

So that would be.

So the last thing I want to say about this is that since many years , I 've been working on that myself , but there has been some people that used to tell me , this is your network. This is your people , okay?

So you have to take care of the people of your people. And so I want to clarify these two concepts. One , network , the network is not mine. The network is the network and I am just one dot in the network and each one of you is another dot.

So we are all moving together. If I disappear tomorrow , so I expect for you to keep doing it because the network is all of us. It 's not one person , okay?

So that 's it. And the other thing is about taking care of the people or the people of my people of the network. And I want to say about this , that that 's a concept vary from the patriarchal system , okay? Where the father or the chairman or the leader has to take care of the people.

So the people could be safe on their his control or whatever.

So , so it 's not like that. I do n't want to take care of any one of you. I want to be clear about this. I guess that responsible is one key word for everything we are doing.

You have to be responsible for yourself. And we are just here working together. Each one of it is on its own part.

So we are not here to project any patriarchal system , okay?

So that 's it. The patriarchal system in which we can also take some Fraud explanations about it. But if we are trying to leave Fraud also behind because some things are not very from our days.

So we also have to leave those kind of things behind too.

So of course , my part of all this is to speak here. And I have to be very responsible for everything that I say here because of course , there 's a lot of people listening. But also I just want to remind you that I am just doing my part in the network. I am not the center of the network.

So each one of us has its own part and my part is this to speak.

So imagine that picture this that that we are all a big network. And each one of us is one dot. One twenty dot in all this network.

So now that each one of those notes , one of them goes up under one goes down and so on like moving constantly like on some of them up some of them down and it 's organic , okay?

So this movement , this organic movement.

Now we will see it as the waves in the ocean.

So like waves in the ocean. Do you have the image?

So now picture this that there 's no answer in that network , okay? It 's a whole and it 's very like with weird shapes.

So you have oceans , seas , inner sea , base , like for example , you have the Atlantic Ocean and just by 14 kilometers you have the draught or straight towards the Mediterranean , which is very big inside , okay?

So all the shapes of the water , they have no center. And even if we think that the center of the Pacific Ocean is the deepest part in the center of everything is not. Basically this deepest part is in a corner down Japan in the Mariana trench. All the waves in that ocean since sea is like one of those notes going up and the other one going down all the waves constantly.

So now imagine this that you have the sun above you , okay? And the sun reflects the pendulum in which moment of the day reflects the water and it starts to make shine the waves.

So maybe one wave going up will shine in that ocean and one wave just aside the other one will reflect into other direction.

So what is the light light are the parts of photons , the photon particles that come from the sun and they reflect in the water of our planet.

So these reflections is basically photons crushing with the waves , with the atoms of the water and reflecting in different directions.

So what we are looking in the ocean , like normally we see these stars like if it 's like magic and fairy , okay? All this movement that is beautiful in the ocean are basically particles of photons crushing the water in the atoms of the water. And reflecting in so many directions that we can not see perfectly perfectly the wave.

So we see all this light going everywhere.

So those things that we are lecturing right now is what we call reflexes. Reflexes.

So what is reflection? Reflexes comes from the red that means to come back and flick the red that means to bend and to turn back.

So this means that all the light that goes into something that we see that goes to some spot. It will bend itself turning back to me.

Okay?

So that 's reflection.

So the same way in which the light reflects the particles of light reflects in the atoms of the water. And we see the shining. Every living being with water inside will also do exactly the same.

So the reflection of this part towards me. But also we have to understand this that these tiny particles of light , the photons are basically everywhere. They create reality. Everything that exists is basically light.

This heat that we feel in our body and this where we call the aura is basically this particle. These particles that are moving through our own body and they expand from our body.

So they expand from our body. And this expansion is like if we are a sun. We start a sun in the sky. But now we reflect that we emit that light to the waves of the water of the people around us.

So basically our light , okay? Our inner light will expand and reflect in the water the blood and the eyes of the other people around us coming back to us.

So I do n't know if you picture this sometimes but the sun can not see its own light. It is the light but it is impossible for the sun to see its own reflection , some light.

So the only way in which some do that is by the light projecting in the planets around. Mercury in Venus , Earth , the Moon , Mars , Jupiter and so on. When this light from the sun goes to the planets , it touched the planets and it bent themselves again coming back to the sun.

So this light coming back goes through every planet because the photons does n't see matter , it just goes through.

So when the photons come and they reflect in some of our arms , a mole and modify our energy with the light of the sun reflected in the air of the sun.

So this is how I am getting molded by planets , so astrology.

So basically it 's because the photons are reflecting the light on the planet.

So basically if I take the example that I am the sun of my own solar system , so the people around are like the planets. I will project that light to the planets , the planets will reflect it into me with their own energy.

So this is how I am going to see what is happening.

So one thing that we have to understand is that the same energy they have and it 's only one that I project in the outside. But the reflection of that light will be different if the planet that reflected is Venus or the planet that reflected is Mars. Venus will reflect my energy with love and Mars will reflect my energy with war.

So this is why it 's not precisely and exactly that everything that I project outside will come as a reflection to me in the facts of others. Because we are missing the point that the others are planets with its own molecular composition. And the reflection that I receive is according to the molecules where it reflected. Basically as I said , it 's not that what you expand is exactly the same everywhere and you will receive exactly the same like a mirror.

No , basically what happens is that everything that I expand will be reflected according to the person that reflected the composition of that person.

So when I have something to learn to from myself that I do n't see for myself , I will of course understand what I have from the rage if I reflect it in Mars or from love if I if I project it in in Venus.

Okay , so it 's the same information but different people different compositions. I guess that with this you can picture it so if you did n't listen it again.

So as an example , imagine myself saying again , same for me humans are basically tools that we have to use for evolution. I say this and some of you will receive this information and you will answer back saying yes I totally rebound with this thank you you clarify this. And there will be some other people that does n't love to to feel used they will say I do n't like it I do n't want to be used by anything lot of that.

So I did a reflection I said exactly the same information but two different answers by the answers.

Okay , what I am going to be able to understand is okay , so I have to look at different way to explain this.

So other people can understand it more equally so my message is not mistaken.

Okay , but the message is this is what I have so there are two different ways in which it is reflected on me.

So I can see how can I change the way in which I express it.

Okay , this is to understand how reflection works that everything that comes to me is a reflection that I created but it 's distorted by the energy of the other person.

Okay , so it 's not about how can I change it in order to myself free from that is about how can I transform the way in which I express it.

## Daily Practice Elements

Okay , let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is. The statement is I am eternal expansion. The code for today is the fourth dimension while patterns limited bodies into its three deposition in the fourth dimension the key is evolution the constant modification of that body.

Thus it 's it 's related to the unlimited process this means that the movement of the bodies acknowledging different perspective of its development process here time is tangible and manageable. Let 's go to the alignment. See the comfortable seat comfortable. Move your shoulders.

And we focus in our breathing as we leave the weight all down. I become aware. Of the light around me. Receiving the photons going through my body to the core of it.

## Energy Work

I recognize myself as light within and outside as one light only for I am I am. Take a deep breath and recognize I am the higher self going down through my body crossing through the crown. Third eye. Third heart.

Plexus. Second. Root. Hmm.

Peace. One night goes. I become aware of the light of the eye on. You are engaging inside my body.

I set my intention. I desire to find the origin of all my reflections. I descend from my feet to the core of the planet. Going through the crust by the roots , stems and boroughs.

Feeling the heat and pressure of the maximum. Going faster and faster to the core , the iron core of the earth in the darkness in the pressure. I feel the darkness and the pressure in the core are all the things from the world comes to me. I feel the pressure pushing the iron to expand.

Going north , up and down in the south. And I feel the freedom of this pressure expanding in my feet and my family. I feel the pressure of the core. It 's a sense in light on my feet and crown creating the southern lights and the northern lights.

I feel the shining , and the bright light on the sky. The southern and northern lights , with this beautiful emerald and green color , through all my mental feel around the earth. The earth is from the deepest part of myself. I am the eternal expansion.

I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth.

I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth.

I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth.

I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth.

I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth.

I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth. I feel the energy of the earth.
