# Day 100 - The 11:11 Portal: Reflexes of Light

## Daily Practice Elements

**Vibration**: NEW  
**Statement**: "I am eternal expansion"  
**Chakra**: Feet (Toroidal Completion)  
**Law**: Law of the Fourth Dimension - While patterns limit bodies into its three disposition, in the fourth dimension the key is evolution—the constant modification of that body. Thus it's related to the unlimited process. This means that the movement of the bodies, acknowledging different perspectives of its development process—here time is tangible and manageable.

## Overview

Today is Day 100, the 11:11 portal, and the completion of the toroidal week of the mind—a perfect alignment of celebration and teaching. The 11:11 code reminds us that we are one (1) serving the other one (1), which is ourselves, and when we repeat it, it's a master code reminding us we are on the path to reconnect with the unified self. Every day is a portal (moving from one point to another, from day to night), but 11:11 is special because of the code itself—when millions of humans see this pattern on the same day, it's like the whole humanity's neurons firing together, creating a moment of collective awareness. It's not about the Gregorian calendar being aligned with anything astronomical; it's about the code, the pattern, the synchronization.

Today's teaching is about reflexes—how light reflects. We are like the ocean, a network with no center, constantly moving in waves. The sun shines photons onto the water, and these photons crash with atoms of water, reflecting in all directions, creating the beautiful stars and shimmer we see on the ocean surface. Those reflections are what we call reflexes. The same way photons reflect in water, they reflect in every living being with water inside. We are like the sun of our own solar system, projecting light to the "planets" around us (other people), and they reflect that light back to us with their own energy. Venus reflects our energy with love; Mars reflects our energy with war. This is how astrology works—photons reflecting the light of the sun (and our light) through the planets, modifying our energy with the composition of each planet.

Understanding reflexes teaches us that what we expand is not exactly what returns. The reflection we receive is according to the molecules where it reflected—the composition of the person or planet. If we say the same information, some will respond, "Yes, I resonate with this, thank you," and others will say, "I don't like it, I don't want to be used by anything." Two different answers to the same message. By the answers, we can see how our message is being refracted, and we can adjust how we express it. This is understanding how reflection works: everything that comes to us is a reflection we created, but it's distorted by the energy of the other person. It's not about changing ourselves to be free from that; it's about transforming the way we express, the way we shine.

## Core Teaching

### The 11:11 Portal and the Code

Every day is a portal because a portal means to go from one point to another—to go through something. Every day is a portal because you go through day to night. But this day, 11:11, is a code that reminds us: 11 means we are one (1) serving the other one (1), which is ourselves. When we repeat it (11:11), it's a master code that reminds us we are on the path to reconnect with the unified self.

It's not about the day itself; it's about the code. For sure, we have heard that the calendar we have, the Gregorian calendar, doesn't work because it's not aligned with the moon, not aligned with the sun—basically, we're told it's not aligned with anything. So people may say, "I don't know why we are honoring this day if it's not aligned with anything." Well, because of that—because of the code. It's not because of something astronomical or astrological; it's because of the code.

When we see 11:11, it's something that a lot of humans on the same day see the pattern 11:11. Because we are all connected in a network, being the neurons of the planet, when we all see that code, it's like the whole humanity starts to work like, "Whoa, there's something different, something weird." That's why it's an important day—because of the code, not because of what happened in the sky.

### Day 100: Perfect Alignment

Another important thing is that today is Day 100 in the alignments we are doing. We've accomplished 100 days doing this work, and precisely on the day 11:11. It's very important, and it seems like it was all prepared, but no, it wasn't. There was no idea that 11:11 would be the 100. So it's perfect. Everything is perfect. Another thing: if this is 100, we have been doing around 200 hours of alignment by now. That's a lot.

Another thing we have today: today, our day is the torus, the toroidal. We are closing the week of the mind. It's perfect that the whole thing is aligned with the toroidal day. Perfect.

### The Gatherings of 11:11

Today we also remember the two main gatherings that were done on 11:11, which were the ones helping to do what is being done now and helping to connect with all of you. The first one, November 11, 2011, was the moment when it was possible to call everyone and discover that the network was there, that all of us were there, that the only thing we have to do was to call for it, to call for everyone to be connected. It was amazing.

The second one, seven years after that (because it was the septennial), we did it November 11, 2018. The power of that gathering was to reactivate the project of the connection of the grid, the planetary grid, and the network, the sacred geometry of the planet through the project "I Am." So here we are, doing what we received in that gathering. It's perfect. And also, the information we are going to talk about is reflexes, and reflexes is basically that 11:11 is a reflection. So everything is aligned for today—everything is perfectly aligned.

### The Ocean and the Network

About yesterday's message, the being was from the sixth dimension, so his energy is very different from here, but he's connected with the third dimension because six and three are connected. He was trying to explain from the sixth dimension that everything, the reality, is basically like a clock. It has wheels like this, and this means that a specific moment—they're like the o'clock time.

For example, the little hands of the clock: one for the seconds, one for the minutes, one for the hour. Imagine these three little hands are like the body, the soul, and the mind and the spirit. When it's time, like tick-tock, to start another one, to start a new one, you have to be aligned. The three of them have to be aligned so you can start. We have to acknowledge that, because it's not like a game for them. From that point of view, it's like all the clocks. There are energies very strong and hard because they are very strict—the things are like this. So when they say you have to be aligned for a specific moment, you better do so, because it's the moment.

In some other dimensions, we can perceive everything like a game, but in some other dimensions, they don't. It's more accurate. We have to respect that if we are working with everyone.

### The Message: Stop Thinking, Start Feeling

Another thing he said was: stop thinking, stop thinking, because to see the tick-tock, you have to feel, you have to perceive it. If you're thinking about how, why, when, and all these things, you're not going to feel it. You have to perceive that—that is the only way, by feeling, by receiving.

Another important thing he said is that it doesn't matter if we don't know everything that we are supposed to. The important thing is to set the intention. If we set the intention for them, they will perceive it anyway, because it's like an ocean—it's moving forward with intention.

### Clarifying Yesterday's Message

Yesterday, the one connected was the highest part, the part from the sixth dimension. Just to clarify something in case there was misunderstanding: when it was said, "I don't care about you, I could be doing other things, but I am here doing this because I want to work for Earth and blah blah blah"—that's a part of the truth, of course, because from the sixth dimension, humans are basically systems that we use. From the point of view of the sixth dimension, it's like, "It's not about you; it's about something else. You're just tools."

That's very from the sixth dimension. It may seem like ego or arrogance when speaking like this, but it's not about the ego. It's about from where it's being spoken. Depending on the dimension, it seems like ego because we are used to talking like friends and like humans and so on. When we speak from another point of view, they don't see the emotions and the relations that we have here in the third dimension—it's different, it's from another point of view.

### The Network Is Not Mine

The last thing to say about this: since many years, there have been some people who used to tell me, "This is your network. This is your people. You have to take care of your people." And these two concepts need to be clarified.

**One: Network** - The network is not mine. The network is the network, and I am just one dot in the network, and each one of you is another dot. We are all moving together. If I disappear tomorrow, I expect you to keep doing it, because the network is all of us. It's not one person.

**Two: Taking Care of People** - This concept is very from the patriarchal system, where the father or the chairman or the leader has to take care of the people so the people could be safe under his control or whatever. It's not like that. I don't want to take care of anyone. I want to be clear about this. I guess that "responsible" is one key word for everything we are doing. You have to be responsible for yourself, and we are just here working together. Each one of us is on its own part. We are not here to project any patriarchal system.

The patriarchal system in which we can also take some Freudian explanations about it—if we are trying to leave Freud also behind because some things are not very from our days, we also have to leave those kinds of things behind too. Of course, my part of all this is to speak here, and I have to be very responsible for everything that is said here because there are a lot of people listening. But I just want to remind you that I am just doing my part in the network. I am not the center of the network. Each one of us has its own part, and my part is this: to speak.

### The Network Has No Center

Picture this: we are all a big network, and each one of us is one dot, one tiny dot in all this network. Now, each one of those dots, one of them goes up and one goes down and so on, like moving constantly—some of them up, some of them down, and it's organic. This movement, this organic movement, we will see it as the waves in the ocean. Like waves in the ocean. Do you have the image?

Now picture this: there's an ocean in that network. It's a whole, and it's very with weird shapes. You have oceans, seas, inner seas, bays—like, for example, you have the Atlantic Ocean, and just by 14 kilometers, you have the strait toward the Mediterranean, which is very big inside. All the shapes of the water—they have no center. Even if we think that the center of the Pacific Ocean is the deepest part in the center of everything, it's not. Basically, this deepest part is in a corner down by Japan in the Mariana Trench.

All the waves in that ocean, in that sea, are like one of those dots going up and the other one going down—all the waves constantly. Now imagine this: you have the sun above you, and the sun reflects. At which moment of the day does it reflect in the water? It starts to make the waves shine. Maybe one wave going up will shine in that ocean, and one wave just aside, the other one, will reflect in another direction.

### How Reflexes Work: Photons and Light

What is the light? Light is particles of photons—the photon particles that come from the sun and they reflect in the water of our planet. These reflections are basically photons crashing with the waves, with the atoms of the water, and reflecting in different directions. What we are looking at in the ocean, normally we see these stars, like if it's magic and fairy—all this movement that is beautiful in the ocean—are basically particles of photons crashing with the water, the atoms of the water, and reflecting in so many directions that we cannot see perfectly the wave. We see all this light going everywhere. Those things that we are watching right now is what we call reflexes.

**Reflexes**: Reflexes come from the root "re," that means to come back, and "flex," that means to bend and to turn back. This means that all the light that goes into something, that we see that goes to some spot, it will bend itself, turning back to me. That's reflection.

The same way in which the light reflects, the particles of light reflect in the atoms of the water and we see the shining. Every living being with water inside will also do exactly the same—the reflection of this part toward me. But also, we have to understand that these tiny particles of light, the photons, are basically everywhere. They create reality. Everything that exists is basically light.

### We Are Like the Sun

The heat that we feel in our body and what we call the aura is basically these particles that are moving through our own body and they expand from our body. They expand from our body, and this expansion is like if we are a sun. We are a sun. We are a sun in the sky, but now we reflect—we emit that light to the waves of the water of the people around us. Basically, our light, our inner light, will expand and reflect in the water, the blood, and the eyes of the other people around us, coming back to us.

Have you pictured this sometimes? The sun cannot see its own light. It is the light, but it is impossible for the sun to see its own reflection of light. The only way in which the sun does that is by the light projecting in the planets around: Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and so on. When this light from the sun goes to the planets, it touches the planets, and it bends itself again, coming back to the sun.

This light coming back goes through every planet, because the photons don't see matter—they just go through. When the photons come and they reflect in some planet, the light goes back to the sun and modifies the energy with the light of the sun reflected in Mercury or the sun. This is how the sun is getting molded by planets—astrology. Basically, it's because the photons are reflecting the light on the planets.

### Astrology Through Reflexes

If we take the example that I am the sun of my own solar system, the people around are like the planets. I will project that light to the planets; the planets will reflect it into me with their own energy. This is how I am going to see what is happening. One thing that we have to understand is that the same energy—there is only one—that I project to the outside, but the reflection of that light will be different if the planet that reflected is Venus or the planet that reflected is Mars. Venus will reflect my energy with love, and Mars will reflect my energy with war.

This is why it's not precisely and exactly that everything that I project outside will come as a reflection to me in the acts of others, because we are missing the point that the others are planets with their own molecular composition. The reflection that I receive is according to the molecules where it reflected.

### Reflection Depends on Composition

As was said, it's not that what you expand is exactly the same everywhere and you will receive exactly the same like a mirror. No, basically what happens is that everything that I expand will be reflected according to the person that reflected—the composition of that person. When I have something to learn from myself that I don't see for myself, I will, of course, understand what I have from the rage if I reflect it in Mars, or from love if I project it in Venus.

It's the same information, but different people, different compositions. If you didn't listen, listen again.

### The Example of Different Reactions

As an example: imagine myself saying, "For me, humans are basically tools that we have to use for evolution." If this is said, and some of you will receive this information and you will answer back saying, "Yes, I totally resonate with this, thank you, you clarified this." And there will be some other people that don't love to feel used—they will say, "I don't like it. I don't want to be used by anything or that."

So there was a reflection. The same information was said, but two different answers. By the answers, what will be understood is, "Okay, so I have to look at different ways to explain this so other people can understand it more equally, so my message is not mistaken." But the message is this—this is what is held. There are two different ways in which it is reflected back. By this, it can be seen how the way of expressing can be changed.

This is to understand how reflection works: everything that comes to me is a reflection that I created, but it's distorted by the energy of the other person. It's not about how can I change myself in order to be free from that. It's about how can I transform the way in which I express it.

## Practice

The meditation today takes you to the core of the Earth to feel the pressure of the iron core expanding as light through your feet and crown, creating the southern and northern lights—the eternal expansion of reflexes.

**Preparation**: Sit comfortable. Move your shoulders and focus on your breathing as you let the weight all down. Become aware of the light around you, receiving the photons going through your body to the core of it.

**Descent of the I Am**: Recognize yourself as light within and outside as one light only, for you are I Am. Take a deep breath and recognize: I am the higher self going down through my body, crossing through the crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacrum, root, knees, and ankles.

**Setting the Intention**: Become aware of the light of the I Am engaging inside my body. I set my intention: I desire to find the origin of all my reflections.

**Journey to the Core**: Descend from your feet to the core of the planet, going through the crust by the roots, stems, and burrows. Feel the heat and pressure of the magma, going faster and faster to the core, the iron core of the Earth, in the darkness, in the pressure.

**The Core's Expansion**: Feel the darkness and the pressure in the core—all the things from the world come to me. Feel the pressure pushing the iron to expand, going north up and down in the south. Feel the freedom of this pressure expanding in your feet and your crown.

**Northern and Southern Lights**: Feel the pressure of the core ascend in light on your feet and crown, creating the southern lights and the northern lights. Feel the shining and the bright light in the sky—the southern and northern lights with this beautiful emerald and green color through all your mental field around the Earth. The Earth shines from the deepest part of yourself.

**Vibration**: From the core, vibrate the sound **NEW** repeatedly, feeling the lights expand.

**Statement**: Repeat: "I am the eternal expansion. I am the eternal expansion. I am the eternal expansion."

**Return**: Feel the energy of the Earth, the reflexes of light bouncing from the core through your body and out into the universe, and from the universe back to you. Take a deep breath and slowly stretch the body. Open your eyes when ready.

## Key Insights

- Every day is a portal (day to night), but 11:11 is special because of the code: 1 serving the other 1 (ourselves), repeated as a master code of unified self.
- The 11:11 code is important not because of astronomy but because millions of humans see the pattern on the same day, firing the planet's neurons together.
- Day 100 perfectly aligns with 11:11 and the toroidal completion of the mental week—200 hours of alignment accomplished.
- The gatherings on 11/11/11 and 11/11/18 activated the network and the "I Am" project, leading to the work being done now.
- Reflexes are photons crashing with atoms of water and reflecting in all directions, creating the shimmer and stars we see on the ocean.
- We are like the ocean—a network with no center, constantly moving in waves as one organic whole.
- We are like the sun of our own solar system, projecting light to the "planets" (people) around us, and they reflect that light back with their own energy.
- Venus reflects our energy with love; Mars reflects our energy with war—this is how astrology works through photons reflecting on planets' molecular composition.
- What we project is not exactly what returns—the reflection depends on the composition (molecules) of the person or planet where it reflected.
- The same message receives different reactions depending on the composition of the receiver—one resonates, another rejects.
- Everything that comes to us is a reflection we created, but it's distorted by the energy of the other person.
- It's not about changing ourselves to be free from reflections; it's about transforming how we express, how we shine our light.
- The network has no center—each of us is one dot, and if one disappears, the network continues because it's all of us, not one person.
- The concept of "taking care of people" is from the patriarchal system—we don't need that; we need responsibility, each person responsible for themselves.
- From the sixth dimension, humans are systems, tools—it's not ego, just a different perspective that doesn't see third-dimensional emotions.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Tonight, reflect on the reflections you received today. When someone reacted to something you said or did, what composition (Venus love or Mars war) were they reflecting? Write down: "Today, [person] reflected my light with [quality]." Then ask: "Was this showing me something about how I'm expressing my light? How can I transform my expression so my message is clearer?" Remember, you're like the sun—you can't see your own light except through the reflections of the planets (people) around you.

### Applying the Wisdom

Throughout your day, when you receive reactions from others—whether positive or negative—don't take them as absolute truth about you. Understand they are reflections of your light filtered through that person's composition, their molecular makeup, their energy. A "no" from Mars energy and a "yes" from Venus energy are both showing you different aspects of the same light you're projecting. Use the reflections to understand how you can transform your expression, not to change who you are but to shine more clearly, more coherently.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is 11:11 called a portal day?**  
A: Every day is a portal because a portal means going from one point to another—we go from day to night. But 11:11 is special because of the code: 11 means one (1) serving the other one (1), which is ourselves. When repeated (11:11), it's a master code reminding us we're on the path to reconnect with the unified self. It's not about the Gregorian calendar being aligned with anything astronomical; it's about the code itself, the pattern that millions of humans see on the same day, firing the planet's neurons together in collective awareness.

**Q: What makes Day 100 significant?**  
A: Day 100 is the completion of 100 days of alignment work, which equals about 200 hours of collective practice. It perfectly aligns with 11:11 and with the toroidal completion of the mental week. It wasn't planned this way—no one knew 11:11 would be Day 100—but it's perfect. Everything is perfectly aligned for this celebration and completion.

**Q: What are reflexes in terms of light?**  
A: Reflexes are photons (particles of light) from the sun crashing with atoms of water and reflecting in different directions. This creates the beautiful shimmer and stars we see on the ocean surface. "Reflex" comes from "re" (to come back) and "flex" (to bend and turn back)—the light bends itself and turns back. Every living being with water inside reflects light the same way, creating an aura, an energetic field of reflected photons.

**Q: How are we like the sun and the ocean?**  
A: We are like the ocean—a network with no center, constantly moving in waves as one organic whole. We are also like the sun—we project our own light (photons, energy) to the "planets" (people) around us. These people reflect our light back to us with their own energy. Just as the sun can't see its own light except through reflections from planets, we can't see our own light except through the reflections we receive from others.

**Q: How does astrology relate to reflexes?**  
A: Photons from the sun hit planets and reflect back, modified by the molecular composition of each planet. Venus reflects the sun's light with the energy of love; Mars reflects it with the energy of war. This is how the sun (and we) get "molded" by planets—through photons reflecting the light back with different qualities. This is the basis of astrology: light reflecting through different planetary compositions, modifying our energy.

**Q: Why do different people react differently to the same message?**  
A: Because people are like different planets with their own molecular composition. If you say the same thing to two people, one might respond, "Yes, I resonate, thank you," (Venus reflection) and another might say, "I don't like it, I don't want this," (Mars reflection). The same light, the same message, but different reflections based on the composition of the person receiving it. The reflection you receive depends on the molecules (energy) where your light reflected.

**Q: Does this mean my reflections are not really about me?**  
A: Everything that comes to you is a reflection you created by projecting your light, but it's distorted by the energy of the other person. It's about you, but filtered through their composition. It's not about changing yourself to be free from negative reflections. It's about understanding what the reflection is showing you and transforming the way you express your light—not who you are, but how you shine—so your message is clearer, more coherent, less distorted.

**Q: What does it mean that the network has no center?**  
A: The network is like the ocean—it has no center. Even if we think the deepest part of the Pacific is the center, it's actually in a corner (Mariana Trench). The network is all of us as dots, moving up and down like waves, constantly organic. No one person is the center. If one dot disappears, the network continues. The network is not mine or yours—it's all of us. Each person has their own part, their own responsibility. This is not a patriarchal system where one person takes care of everyone; it's a network where everyone is responsible for themselves and we work together.

**Q: Why did yesterday's message sound so harsh or egotistical?**  
A: Because it was spoken from the sixth dimension, where humans are seen as systems, as tools. It's not about ego; it's about perspective. From the sixth dimension, they don't see the emotions and relations we have in the third dimension. It's different, more mechanical, more like clocks that need to be aligned. When speaking from that perspective, it can seem harsh, but it's just a different point of view. They are very strict: when they say you have to be aligned for a specific moment, you better do so, because it's the moment—it's not a game for them.
