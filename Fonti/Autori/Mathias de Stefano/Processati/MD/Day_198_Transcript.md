## Overview

Day 198. Matias is tired—he'll try to get to the point because this topic could take three hours.

We connect with the **knees chakra**—the joints that allow us to move forward, to bend, to keep walking the path even when it's hard.

And today's teaching is **Capricorn**—the constellation that most people find "difficult to handle," even Capricorn people themselves.

Why? Because **Capricorn represents the hard work, the persistence, the relentless drive that says "it's never enough."**

Capricorn is the one who works when everyone else is resting. The one who believes **"the only way to accomplish things is if I do it myself."** The one who carries the weight of responsibility, often in loneliness, because **that's what it takes to reach the summit**.

But there's more to this teaching than work ethic. Matias takes us deep into **mythology and history** to show us how the image of Capricorn—the goat, the ram, the fertility god—was **demonized** and turned into the Christian image of **the devil**.

Understanding this historical distortion is essential. Because when you understand that **Baphomet (the "devil") was actually the god of fertility, agriculture, and hard work**—you can reclaim Capricorn's true power without fear.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology of Capricorn: The Horn of the Ram

The word **Capricorn** comes from two roots:
- **Capri** = the masculine form of "goat" (like a ram or buck)
- **Corn** = "horn"

So **Capricorn** literally means **"the horn of the ram" or "the horned goat."**

This refers to the **male goat that breeds**—the one with the prominent horns, the one that fertilizes the herd, the one that ensures the continuation of life.

But here's something interesting: **Capricorn is not just a goat. It's a goat that's HALF FISH.**

The constellation shows a creature that's **goat in the front, fish in the back**—a hybrid, a liminal being, something that exists between two worlds (land and water, Earth and emotion, physical and subconscious).

We'll come back to why this hybrid form matters. But first, let's understand why the **ram/goat** was so important to humanity.

### The Ram: The Sacred Animal of Survival

In the Middle East and North Africa, the **goats and rams** were **essential for survival**.

They gave:
- **Meat** (food)
- **Wool** (clothing, blankets, shelter)
- **Milk** (nourishment)
- **Bones** (tools, structures)
- **Leather** (for practical use)

**Everything the humans needed came from the ram.**

Because of this, ancient people thought the ram was **a sacred animal, a gift from the gods**—the creature that allowed them to survive in the desert, in the dry regions, in the harsh climates.

The ram became **the symbol of the sun, the symbol of divine provision**.

In Egypt, **Ra** (the sun god) is depicted with the **face of a ram**. Why? Because the ram represents the life-giving, sustaining power of the divine.

### Tragedy: The Ceremony of the Ram's Blood

The ram was so sacred that it became central to **religious rituals**.

The word **"tragedy"** comes from ancient Greek: **"tragos"** (goat/ram) + **"ode"** (song/ceremony).

**Tragedy literally means "the ceremony to kill the ram."**

This was the ritual performed at the **beginning of the sowing season**—when the ram would be sacrificed, its **blood poured onto the ground** to fertilize the soil, to bless the new cycle, to ask the gods for a good harvest.

**The ram's blood was seen as sacred—it carried the divine within.**

Early humans believed that **divinity lived in the blood**. Blood runs through us, giving us life, so **blood = life = divine essence**.

By sacrificing the ram and pouring its blood, they were **giving back to the earth, honoring the cycle, connecting with the gods**.

This is the origin of **sacrifice**—which means **"sacrum officium"** = "the sacred work" or "the office of the sacred."

Sacrifice was not about violence. It was about **sacred exchange, honoring the cycle, participating in the divine work**.

### From Ram Sacrifice to Human Sacrifice (and Back)

Different religions evolved from this practice:

**Before Christianity:**  
- Middle Eastern (Jewish, pre-Islamic) traditions used **rams and lambs** for blood sacrifice to connect with the divine.

**Jesus Christ's Teaching:**  
- Jesus said: **"We don't need animals to make the sacrifice anymore. WE are the lambs of God. We have to make the sacrifice ourselves—not with blood, but with our LIVES."**
- This was a shift from **external sacrifice** (killing animals) to **internal sacrifice** (dedicating your life, your service, your work to the divine).

**After Christianity Spread:**  
- Christians in Europe wanted to **distinguish themselves** from the "old ways" (the pagan, pre-Christian traditions that still honored the ram).
- So they created an image of "the devil" to **make people afraid** of the old practices.
- How? By taking the image of the **ram/goat** (the old fertility god) and turning it into **the symbol of evil**.

### Baphomet: The Fertility God Turned "Devil"

In the Middle East, the god of fertility, hard work, and agricultural blessing was called **Baphomet** (in some traditions) or **Pan** (in Greek tradition).

**Baphomet** (or Pan) was depicted as:
- **Half goat, half human** (or half fish in some versions)
- With **horns** (symbol of power, fertility, the ram)
- Associated with **sexuality, reproduction, the earth, the fields, the harvest**

This god represented:
- **Fertility** (helping women conceive, helping crops grow)
- **Strength** (the power to work the land)
- **Abundance** (the blessing of the harvest)

**Baphomet was not evil. Baphomet was the god of LIFE.**

But when Christianity spread and wanted to **erase the old traditions**, they took this image—the horned, goat-like god of fertility—and said:

**"This is the devil. If you see horns, if you see a goat face, if you worship this—you are worshiping Satan."**

And just like that, **the god of fertility became the image of evil**.

Matias is clear: **"Baphomet is not the devil. The devil was CREATED from the Capricorn image of Baphomet so that Christian people would go away from the old traditions."**

### Pan: The Greek Version of Baphomet

In Greek mythology, the same energy was called **Pan** (which means "all" or "everything").

Pan was the god of:
- **The wild** (nature, untamed energy)
- **Shepherds** (those who tend the flocks)
- **Fertility and sexuality**
- **Music** (he played the pan flute)

Pan was depicted exactly like Baphomet—**goat legs, horns, wild, earthy, sexual**.

And again—this was not "evil." This was **the energy of life, of nature, of the raw creative force**.

But Christianity demonized it. **Pan became "panic"**—the fear, the chaos, the wild energy that must be controlled or rejected.

### Reclaiming Capricorn: Hard Work and Constancy

So now that we understand the **historical distortion**—that Capricorn was demonized to control people—what is the **true teaching** of this archetype?

**Capricorn is the energy of HARD WORK, PERSISTENCE, and CONSTANCY.**

Matias says: **"The key of Capricorn is the work. While other signs are doing different things, Capricorn is working—bit by bit, trying to accomplish its goal."**

**"The main essence of Capricorn, in a positive way, is CONSTANCY."**

Capricorn is the one who:
- **Keeps going** when others quit
- **Works in solitude** because the work must be done
- **Believes in the goal** even when it's far away
- **Carries the weight** because that's what's required

Yes, this can become **negative** when it turns into:
- "It's never enough" (perfectionism, burnout)
- "I have to do it all myself" (isolation, refusing help)
- "Work is the only thing that matters" (losing balance, losing joy)

But in its **positive** expression, Capricorn is **the mountain climber**—the one who takes one step at a time, who doesn't give up, who reaches the summit through **sheer persistence**.

## Practice

### Walking the Path of Your Ancestors with Constancy

Today's practice is about **honoring the Capricorn energy within you**—the part that persists, that works, that carries on.

**Step 1: Stand and Ground**  
Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Bend your knees slightly. Feel your **knees** as the joints that **allow you to keep moving forward**.

Place your hands on your knees. Say: "These knees have carried me. These knees will carry me forward. I honor their strength."

**Step 2: Acknowledge Your Work**  
Think of something you've been working on—a goal, a project, a life change—that requires **persistence**.

Ask: "What have I already accomplished through constancy? What have I kept going with, even when it was hard?"

**Don't dismiss it.** Capricorn doesn't celebrate often enough. **Acknowledge the work you've done.**

**Step 3: Identify What Needs Constancy**  
Now ask: "What requires my constancy NOW? What needs me to keep showing up, bit by bit, even when I can't see the summit yet?"

Let the answer arise. It might be:
- A relationship
- A creative project
- A healing process
- A daily practice

**Step 4: Make a Commitment**  
Say aloud: "I commit to showing up for this. Not perfectly. Not all at once. But **constantly**. One step at a time."

**Step 5: Sound the Vibration**  
With your hands still on your knees (or placed on your thighs), sound the vibration **"Su"** three times, feeling it resonate in your legs, your foundation, your ancestral roots.

This is the frequency of **the path of your ancestors**—the lineage of workers, builders, survivors who kept going.

**Step 6: Speak the Statement**  
Say aloud: **"I Am the Path of My Ancestors."**

You are the continuation of their work. You are the one who carries forward what they began. You honor them by **not giving up**.

**Step 7: Walk Forward**  
Physically take **10 steps forward**. Slowly. Deliberately.

With each step, say: "I am constant. I keep going. I am the mountain climber."

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**The Constancy Check:**  
Identify one thing you can do **every day** for the next week (or month) toward your goal.

Not something huge. Something **small but constant**:
- 10 minutes of practice
- One paragraph of writing
- One healthy meal
- One moment of meditation

**Commit to it. Show up for it. This is Capricorn.**

**Reclaim the Goat:**  
If you've been afraid of Capricorn energy (thinking it's "too serious" or "too hard"), today **reclaim it**.

Say: "The goat is not the devil. The goat is the worker, the climber, the one who persists. I honor this energy within me."

**Honor Your Knees:**  
Throughout the day, when you walk, **notice your knees**. Thank them for carrying you forward, for bending when needed, for keeping you on the path.

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching today is: **Constancy is not the same as rigidity. Persistence is not the same as perfectionism.**

Capricorn gets a bad rap because people think it's "all work, no play" or "cold and serious." And yes—**unbalanced** Capricorn can be that.

But **balanced** Capricorn is something else entirely:

It's the **quiet determination** that keeps showing up.  
It's the **mountain climber** who doesn't rush, but also doesn't stop.  
It's the **builder** who lays one brick at a time, knowing that eventually, there will be a house.

In a world that glorifies **instant results, viral success, overnight transformation**, Capricorn reminds us:

**Real change takes time. Real work is done in the dark. Real mountains are climbed one step at a time.**

And that's not a limitation. **That's power.**

## Aquarius Emotional Week Context

We are in the Emotional Week of Aquarius, and today we connect with the **knees chakra**—the joints that allow us to keep walking the path.

Capricorn, as an Earth sign, teaches us that **even in the Aquarian age of innovation and networks, we still need HARD WORK**. We still need constancy. We still need to show up, bit by bit, to build what we envision.

The network doesn't build itself. The vision doesn't manifest by magic. **Someone has to do the work.**

Capricorn is that someone.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does "Capricorn" literally mean?

**"Horn of the ram"** (Capri = goat/ram, Corn = horn). It refers to the **male goat with prominent horns**—the breeder, the one who ensures fertility and continuation of the herd. It's also depicted as **half goat, half fish**—a hybrid creature between Earth and water, physical and emotional realms.

### Q: Why was the ram considered sacred in ancient times?

Because **the ram provided everything humans needed to survive** in harsh climates: meat, wool, milk, bones, leather. It was seen as **a gift from the gods**, a symbol of divine provision. That's why the Egyptian sun god Ra is depicted with a **ram's face**—the ram represents life-giving power.

### Q: What does "tragedy" mean, and how is it related to Capricorn?

**"Tragedy" = "ceremony to kill the ram"** (tragos = goat/ram, ode = song/ceremony). It was the ritual of **sacrificing the ram's blood** at the beginning of the sowing season to bless the earth and ask for a good harvest. The ram's blood was seen as sacred—carrying divinity within.

### Q: How did Baphomet become associated with the devil?

**Baphomet was the Middle Eastern god of fertility, hard work, agriculture, and abundance**—depicted with goat features and horns. When Christianity spread, they wanted to **erase pagan traditions**, so they took the image of Baphomet (the fertility god) and **turned it into the image of the devil**. Horns became "evil" instead of sacred. This was a **deliberate demonization** to control people.

### Q: Who is Pan, and how is he related to Capricorn?

**Pan** is the Greek version of the fertility god (same as Baphomet). He's the god of **nature, shepherds, fertility, sexuality, and music**—depicted with goat legs and horns. His name means "all" or "everything." He represents the **wild, creative life force**. Christians demonized him too—and "Pan" became "panic" (fear of the wild, uncontrolled energy).

### Q: What is the positive expression of Capricorn?

**CONSTANCY.** Capricorn is the one who **keeps going when others quit**, who works bit by bit toward the goal, who climbs the mountain one step at a time. It's quiet determination, persistence, the willingness to carry the weight because the work matters. It's the builder, the climber, the one who shows up even when no one's watching.

### Q: What does "I Am the Path of My Ancestors" mean?

The knees are the joints that **keep you moving forward on the path**. When you say "I Am the Path of My Ancestors," you're recognizing that **you are the continuation of their work**. You carry their lineage, their persistence, their survival forward. You honor them by **not giving up**, by walking the path they opened for you.
