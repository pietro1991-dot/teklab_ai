## Introduction

Hello everybody. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening to everyone.

How are you?

So I will try to now get a slip and to.

So today is the day of Dense in the emotional wake of Aquarium and the topic for today is Capricorn Capricorn course. Constellation. For sure , Capricorn is one of the most difficult.

Sonic signs for everyone even for themselves. Because Capricorn is the one that represents the hard work that willing to accomplish the never 's enough. Let 's say it in this way. It 's never enough for the Capricorn.

So difficult to handle. The loneliness because the Capricorn things that the only way to accomplish things is if they do it by themselves. I 'd like to begin by remembering you that I 'm not speaking about the people that is Capricorn and talking about the archetype of Capricorn.

So again to remind you , I 'm not speaking about the people that is Capricorn because for example someone can say no but I 'm Capricorn and I 'm not like this. Like you are saying , I 'm totally different. Yes of course because everyone is different and in the astrological chart maybe you have the sun in Capricorn but then you have I do n't know , merely in cancer or in Venus , Venus in cancer or the rice in sun in Aquarium and moon in Pieces.

So basically with that you are not Capricorn at all. You have nothing of Capricorn.

So I am not speaking about the sun sign of a person. I am speaking about the archetype by itself. I love them.

So of course that Capricorn , the key of Capricorn is the key of Capricorn is the work and we can tell that while the other signs are doing different things for sure Capricorn is working , bit by bit trying to accomplish its goal and the key , the main essence of Capricorn in a positive way is constant. Constant is the most important thing to remember about this sodium sign.

So let 's go to sorry.

So the thing is to understand from where it comes from , where Capricorn is coming from.

So first of all Capricorn , the word Capricorn means April means the masculine of the goat which is Iran , something like that. Imagine kind of like Iran.

So this is the Iran and Corner means horn.

Okay , so basically the name of Capricorn means the horn Iran. And the reason why is the horn Iran is because it 's the male that breeds. Yes , I 'm saying it right , is the male that breeds the goats. Well , kind of like that.

So so everyone can say , Nris is the Iran. Yes , Nris is the Iran. Completely run , but Capricorn has something different. It 's not only Iran.

It 's the Iran that is half fish is something different. Even if Capricorn is describing Iran that has horns.

Okay , so it 's the horn Iran. It 's not describing it 's it 's main characteristic which is half fish. And now we are going to go into the history of why this being is so weird and why we took it. Why we took it as one constellation.

So first of all , let 's try to understand why the Iran , why the lamb are so where this animal is so important for humanity. And this is basically because in the middle in the middle east in Africa the goats , the rams , were very important for everything that they gave to humanity. They gave flesh , meat , fun.

So the wool , the bones , the everything was used by the humans.

So basically the people in that time they used to think that the ram was kind of the of the sacred animal that the gods have given to us.

So we can we can do everything. We can survive.

So they were the lambs of god that were given to the humans to survive in the desert to survive in the in the dry regions.

Okay , because they did everything. They ate the garbage , they gave milk everything.

Okay , so that 's why they 're related this animal with the sun. Like this is the symbol of the sun.

So rah the god of the sun in Egypt has the face of the ram.

Okay , because it 's that symbolism.

So this is the the the concept of the middle Middle East.

So this is the the symbolism of the Middle East.

So all the regions , all the people from that region were using the rams , the lambs , the goats , for the sacrifices.

Okay , remember the word that we say tragedy. Tragedy means the ceremony to kill the ram. When the ram gives the blood for the ceremony of the sowing to start a new cycle.

So of course that for us today would be very very weird to think this. But in the first times of humanity , we actually thought that the way to communicate with god was through blood , because we had the divinity inside , we had the divine within.

So the blood was running and given us life.

So we thought that the divinity was in our blood.

So by sacrifices , which means scrum office , sacrifice means the office , the work of the sacred things. That 's that 's a minute of sacrifice. Is when do you do something and job a work that is sacred?

Okay , so they kill a goat , they drink the blood , they kill someone , they drink the blood in order to communicate with the gods with the divine.

So we can judge that today because that 's how it began before. For us today it 's horrible , but for that time was the way in which they connected with the divine.

So the same way that we use the rams , the lambs to give the blood as a sacrifice for the gods , the different religions started to think that we also wear rams and lambs for god.

So we are the lambs of god , for example , some religions started to say.

So this means that not only these animals had to make the sacrifices , but also humans needed to make the sacrifices with blood for the hard work , so the god would be happy.

So important to know that in the middle , in the middle all the semantic traditions , like the Jewish , like the Muslims , all these kind of people in the middle ages , they used the rams to have to make the sacrifices. Until Jesus Christ comes and says , we do n't need animals to make the sacrifice because we are the lambs of god. We have to make the sacrifice by ourselves. We do n't need to use animals to make the sacrifices.

So what they started to do was to live behind all these traditions that they were using to the Christians in the first times because they were Jewish too. They left all these traditions and they started to say we are the lambs of god. We have to sacrifice ourselves , not these animals.

Okay?

So after Christ dies , the other Christians that went to Europe and so on started to spread this idea that everyone who believed in the ram was the devil. It was something against Christ because it 's something from the old times.

So we need to get rid of it.

So the way in which they help people to understand that God is within and not honoring this animals was by creating the image of the devil and how they created the idea of the devil by the ram.

So they took the images of the ram , they took the images of the ship and all this animals and they put them together so they created an idea of the devil.

So they could know what is wrong. This sacrifice is for the devil. If you see horns , if you see the ship face , the gold face , so do n't get close to it is the devil.

Okay?

So that 's how the Christians started to create the image of the devil from the ram. This is why the capricorn shape was called in the middle , in the middle , east like basement. Basement is this God that represented the hard work of the fields and it was the one given the the strength for the good sewing , the good harvest for the good babies so the women could get pregnant. This is the image of that God of basement.

Okay?

So they use that image of basement to create the devil.

So that 's why today we have the image like if basement is the devil itself but it 's not. It 's capricorn is the one that represented the fertility , is the God of fertility. They helping the women , helping the the the fields , the farmers and so on because it was the goat and the goat had all the tools we needed to survive.

Okay?

So that was the symbolism.

So basement is not the devil. The devil was created from the capricorn image of basement so the Christian people would go away from the old traditions.

Okay?

So now speaking about the mythology , let 's go to Greece. This basement for Greece was the photo. The photo is this one that we all call and we know as pan.

Okay?

So Peter Pan. Pan is the photo that used to represent the fertility and the happiness of the earth but he always wanted to be a lobe. No bothering. No one bothering.

So he lived in the mountains by himself but he was someone that helped the gods all the time.

So in the Tetonomakia which is the stories of the gods and the titans fighting the monsters and so on of the stories of monsters and so on. There was the biggest monster of all that was called typhoon. Typhoon was this huge son of Gia , the earth. That was so huge , so big that that he could take all the the mountains with the hands and had snakes , legs all around and and that was so big and so huge that his head touched the sky and stars.

So it was so big that he destroyed everything when he was moving around.

So when the gods wanted to fight this huge being the pan , the photo used to let them know that this monster was coming by touching the horn.

So making the sound the gods would know that the monster was coming so they would get ready for the fight.

So this monster was following pan and he just tried to hide himself in the waters of the nine.

So he went down to the nine and sees because pan was helping them. He decided to make him half fish.

So he could survive and adapt into this new water in this new environment.

So he could adapt to something different in order to accomplish its purpose.

So who is typhoon? Typhoon is basically this huge monster that rises up in the sky and destroys everything which is the hurricane , the typhoon.

So this typhoon is destroying everything so everyone was afraid of it and this one , this also was the name of the change of the weather.

So in the middle ages , in the middle the middle is this change of weather brought the sandstones brought the cold brought the ice and the mountains.

So the hands this covering the mountains and you know the description of this monster is describing the weather of the winter. The winter is coming.

So if the winter is coming this means that the monster will kill us.

So the first one of coming from the mountains down where the goats , the shepherds.

So the shepherds , the goats , the rams , were coming down because of the cold weather and they came where to the rivers they needed to survive during the winter close by the rivers.

So it was the hottest part.

So they needed to survive by the fishes in the winter.

So they needed to survive with the grasses around the rivers and that 's why all the hearts of ships and rams and lambs they came to the rivers. This symbolism is the one that shows us that winter is the time of copper corn is the time where the rams represent the survival. We need it to survive because winter is the most tough time.

So you have to work hard , you have to be very consistent if you want to survive the winter and that 's very capricorn.

So this is why copper corn is very tough and really harsh for people and is the one that makes us work very hard that takes us to the limit to work as much as we can for nothing sometimes.

Okay?

So that 's why it 's kind of a hell for most of the people to do what the copper corn does and that 's why we 're related with fathomates.

So first of all remember the devil that 's an excess by itself. The devil is an image created in the middle ages for the Christian people in order for them not to to worship the old traditions. And also Capricorn is the one that makes this work. It 's the one that tells us this is the hardest moment and you have to do this.

The positive key of Capricorn is constant seed.

So now we are going to relate this attribute of constant seed with the spiritual attribute of the earth.

Remember that we have this variety of Capricorn.

Sorry , this variety of earth , the symbol of earth , which is torus representing the body , Virgo representing the soul and Capricorn represents in this period.

## Q&A

So they are wrote in the blog. The question of how is possible that Capricorn is the one the represents the spirit of the earth. If Capricorn is the hardest sign of all. It 's like not still at all.

It 's the one that makes it the hard work and you have to do it better and so on.

So why why Capricorn would be that?

So the answer is really easy. The only way you can connect with the spiritual aspect of the earth is by the minerals that we call diamonds , crystals , how to say this , quartz. And the only way you can get those diamonds is under a great pressure. As much pressure they get , the best is the crystal or the diamond.

And this example of the diamond is the one that talks about all evolution. Evolution on earth , we , what we exist , all the beauty things that we know today from this world , come from the pressure , the pushing of the billions of years of evolution in this earth that with patience and constant makes us better and better , making us evolve.

So when we usually speak about spirituality , we used to relate the spirits with something that is very high level subtle like air. But what really is the spirit is the best version of itself. Is the best aspect activated of something?

So for the earth , for the earth , this result of biology , this result of the material physical world is the best it could create.

So the spirituality of earth is not about still , it 's about the beauty that is able to manifest through the constant and patience of billions of years.

So capricorn is the one that says to us , we can always improve ourselves.

So if we have patience , constant , if we accept our mistakes as a way to improve , so we will get to evolve. And the key of evolution is to know that there is no a goal , that there is no ending , that you can always be better. Hmm. Also , this is one of the things why capricorn is very very aware away from the religion that says you will set yourself free in the heavens because for capricorn is like , no , we have to evolve.

We have to try it again. We have to improve.

So there 's no heaven and beautiful things around. We need to do our job by ourselves. No Savior , we have to do it by ourselves.

So of course that capricorn is also one of the negative aspects of this capricorn is that we 'll never see other options. There are so focused that they do n't want to see anything else. That this is the way I 'm going to do it. And I do n't care what you say.

I do n't care if there is an easier way. This is my way. And I will do it in this way until it comes.

So it 's very difficult to change the mind of a capricorn in their beliefs. And they are trapped in this , in this thing , this thought. Yeah. And of course everything will be done to accomplish success.

For this concept of capricorn , everything that I have around even people are things that I can use. Our tools to make me get to my goal. And of course that in the opposite side of capricorn will be cancer and cancer will be the one saying , we do n't have to work much. We can be all together sharing this love that we all feel and so on.

So of course it 's exactly the opposite and complementary for it.

So now it 's important to know what this energy of capricorn gives us for this new age of Aquarium. We are the month of the virus. The thing that this this archetype is given to us is basically patients. Patience and much more patience.

We need to go step by step. If we are creating this new humanity for Aquarium , we should not expect that this will happen tomorrow. That this will happen right now. We need to just weave each node one by one inside of us.

Then to weave the other nodes outside step by step , patience. This is not going to happen right now. It will take a long time and if we make mister , do n't worry. We start again.
