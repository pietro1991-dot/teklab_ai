## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So there we are together.

Today , well , we are all together here. Usually every totalling date we connect online with them to be together , connected. This time we are all here together and we were to the pyramid to one of the pyramids today.

So we have been connecting the totalling , physically.

So that 's why I wanted to start today with the alignment that we are all together here. We will start by the alignment first and then I will start explaining about tomorrow. I do n't have battery , so I do n't have the music.

So today we have been in Sahara and the pyramids of Sahara and we were all together there. It 's been really powerful. But we just came from Sahara.

So we did n't have the time to really share and understand what happened there.

So I will explain you and share with you tomorrow when we finish.

So today we were in Sahara , and Sahara , the place to activate the prototype , the cube.

So we download or activate all the frequency of the different elements from north to south , time and space , we connect them all to the void and from the void we expanded to the heart of each one of the people present there.

So now in a few hours , just a few hours , we will go to the things to activate this information and then to spread it into the entire network. Through the great pyramid of cubes.

So all of that is the preparation to go then to to Abu Rab for the alignment during the eclipse. And remember that the eclipse tomorrow makes a new beginning for our IPA because it will be the season in between the eclipse. Until the December 4th , which is the path of the Kundalini of the planet.

So the path of dragon.

So tomorrow begins a new path , a new way or energy for the path. Let 's do this altogether , connecting.

So we can prepare all of us as one for tomorrow. We sit comfortable , close our eyes , and concentrate now our breathing. I become aware of my physical body , lingering it here and now. I become an aware of this body that I inhabit.

I bring my attention to my feet. Going now to my legs to keep waist , fall the back , shoulders , arms , hands. I relocate my body moving on to softly.

So I move softly my head in circles until I find my axis. I imagine that I have a mirror in my body. And a mirror in front of me. I can see myself in the reflection from the feet to the head to the legs , the chest , hands and arms.

So I 'm staring. Watch his face to my eyes. I take a good breath. I sit in my reflection.

I position myself as the one that is. I recognize me the verb to be. And in my reflection I can see all the things that can tell about myself not to be the boy. From this side I am everything.

From the other side I am nothing. And only express a new being in my life. A new way of being to the void of not being. If I am aware of this , I connect myself to the heart of my reflection and I sit in the feet in the spiral of deep and not to be.

I use my hands if it 's the fine need and connect from part of heart to the reflection. I connect from part of heart. But I am an only face that I am not in order to be alone to become something new in a new reality. And I trust in the love of existence.

## Guided Meditation

And I recognize these two forces , the sun and the moon. I am the sun , the regulating light being reflected on the moon. And between my darkness and my light I am able to create a new path. I say breathe , I imagine this infinite spiral.

I explain it throughout all my body from my feet to my head. I 'm expanding the information of the I am and all the things that I am not. I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the only face that I am not in the world.

I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the only face that I am not in the world. I expand the vibration of the spiral.

I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the only face that I am not in the world.

I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the only face that I am not in the world. I am the eternal spiral. I think I think I think I think I think.

I believe that I think I think that I am the only face that I am not in the world. Take a deep breath , and each one , edit some time , start to come back. Here and now stretch you in your mouth. Here and now stretch you in your mouth.

Here and now stretch you in your mouth. And with this energy we close our mind , wake of Gemini.

## Daily Practice Elements

So the task to make is that if you are quiet in a place in your home or whatever , put the symbols of the , the symbols of the sodium signs around like in a clock and in the center candle and use there at the light of the candle as you mediate listening the , the 12 names , the mantra of the tone names that you have in everywhere in YouTube in Spotify in all the platforms.

So you can listen and connect with the 12 names of the creator.

## Q&A

So for you to have the intention of what is the task , so we will be connecting the head and an earth in a tube of light where we will set the intention to download from different dimensions , the information towards the crystals that are going to be sold in the planet.

So I will put in the social media some keys and pictures that you can be related to so you can mediate and I will put all information for you to be connected tomorrow throughout all the social media. Thank you everybody for being here as always. Yes , thank you. This has been a very crazy week.
