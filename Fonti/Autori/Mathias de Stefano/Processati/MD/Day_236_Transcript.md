- **Code:** Scorpio - the necessities that take us to the next plane. Upmerging again in the deep waters of the soul, the poison of the scorpion can kill and heal. In the presence of a scale imbalance, it can take me to see the darkest of my basic needs or show me the inability of finding the soul's nourishment beyond physical. Scorpion will be the constellation that reminds us about the deepest search in the mud of the beam, in what we don't want to see or work on, like the ability to find the deepest truth.

## Overview

Today we begin with the Physical Week of Pisces, exploring the topic of **devotion**. This is Day 236, connecting with the sacral chakra, transmitted from Kom Ombo, Egypt, after visiting the temple earlier in the morning.

We usually know devotion as the feeling people have for divinity, for God, within a religion or dogma. But we're going to understand the metaphysics behind this concept and how we live it from the inside perspective.

Devotion is not just about religion—it's about the promise we make to constantly put our energy and will into something or someone we love.

---

## The Etymology of Devotion

### Votum: The Promise

**Devotion** comes from the Latin words:
- **De** = towards
- **Votum** = promise

Votum is like when you vote in a political campaign. It's a promise of something that you maintain doing for a long time.

This makes votum like a celebrity concept. Remember we spoke about being a celebrity, which is to maintain something during a whole year. Something that you say, something that you express, you hold it through the whole year.

Votum is also the promise that you do to keep things during a period of time, like when you vote for a politician.

### Devotion: The Constant Promise

**Devotion** with the "de" in front means to dedicate your entire year, your entire time into that promise.

It's not just a promise you do for something in the future. To be devoted is to be constantly putting your energy, your will, every day into that promise.

This is why the devotion—the one who has devotion for something, for the divine, for whatever—is someone that constantly every day is maintaining a discipline towards this concept.

We could say that during 2020 and 2021, most of us are being devoted to the I Am.

---

## Devotion Beyond Religion

### Not Only About Religion

We usually relate devotion with religion, but it's not always like this.

Devotion can also be expressed to:
- Someone that we admire
- Something or someone that we love
- Family, friends, relationships
- Someone we fell in love with

We usually relate the concept of devotion in a religious way because when we become part of a religion, we make a promise, a devotion. We make a promise to a divinity, to a God or Goddess, whatever. And religions have this practice that keeps people doing exactly the same. That's why we relate devotion with religion.

But basically, devotion speaks about this promise that you do of loving and connecting with something or with someone that you feel a lot, that you love a lot.

---

## The Two Ways of Loving

### Unconscious Way: Devotion

Devotion is usually related to the **unconscious way of loving**.

Why? Because usually when we are devoted to something, we project our energies. We project our love into something that is outside. We put all of us in the outside.

So we have these two ways of loving:
1. **The unconscious way** (related to devotion): giving energy to something outside
2. **The conscious way**: realizing that those things you love are just a part of yourself, just a projection of yourself

---

## Devotion and Divinity

### The Hidden Meaning: Divine

Here we have another meaning of the word devotion hidden behind it: the concept of **divine**.

When we are devoted to something, we put all of our energy into the love of something that is outside. And that's usually related to the gods, to the divinity.

### Etymology of Divine

**Divinity** comes from the etymology in the Vedic language that gave us the name **Deva**, which is **Dev**.

Dev means **day**, **light of day**. That's the origin of the name.

So from there, divinity comes. The concept of devotion also encodes the idea of devotion for divinity.

### Following the Light

When we are devoted to something, like having devotion for divinity, is because we are looking for the light, the day, the Deva in something. We have the clarity, the light inside something, and we are attracted by that light.

Imagine a lamp and the insects—you will see how many insects go to the light and they end up dead on the bulb. Just as an advice: follow the light wisely.

The reason why we follow divinities is because we are looking for the light.

Remember: **divine**, **Deva** means light, day.

---

## The Mistake: Looking for Light Outside

### We Don't Recognize Our Own Light

Looking for that light, we usually fall into the mistake of believing that we don't have the light and we have to find that light outside in others.

Looking for that light, we don't recognize that we also can shine. We put all our intention and love, believing that the only way we can feel that light is outside in someone, in a divinity.

The devotion that I have onto some divinity is the promise that I do to myself to go towards the light which is in that divinity in which I am projected to.

---

## The Lamp Metaphor

### Sitting in the Dark Corner

Imagine that you are inside a room and you are seated on a corner. In the other corner you have a light, a lamp.

From that point of view where you are seated, you can see the whole room because of the light from the lamp.

So imagine that what we do, our thought is: "Oh, so if the light is the one that gives me clarity to see everything around, I have to get the light. I have to go to the light."

### Getting Closer to the Light

Imagine that you start to get closer to the light, and you get so close and so close to the light that two things happen:

1. **You start to be blind** because there's so much light into your eyes that you cannot see anything
2. **The closer you get to the light, the bigger is the shadow**

When you are with the light here and you catch the light between your arms, then the entire room will be in dark and the only place with the light will be here.

### The Purpose of Light

The main goal of light is to show me the reality, to show me what is there in the room.

It's not about having the light that makes me more clear. It's like trying to see the world by just staring and gazing at the sun. If you just stare at the sun, you're not going to be able to see the beauties of the world.

You have to see the beauties of the world when there is the light of the sun during the day.

### Walking Around the Room

What we have to do in order to see the beauties of this room is to **walk around the room** and watch, observe everything that the light is allowing us to see in that room, in that space.

Because if we go to catch the light for ourselves, to get the light for ourselves, what happens is that we are not going to be able to see anything. We are creating much more darkness instead.

---

## Realizing the Light Within

### Walking Around the World

After walking around the world, after recognizing many things from the reality, from the planet, we start to realize that **that same light is within ourselves**.

And the reason is because the light that is in the outside of the room is just a polarized image of ourselves, is a projection from ourselves.

We are that same shadow that we are projecting and we are that same light that we are watching.

### Becoming the Light

When I realize that I myself am the light, suddenly I will know that I will be like the light of the sun, the light of the moon, the light of the lamp that helps me to see the shapes of the things around me.

If I am that light, I will recognize that all the things that I see in the reality around me are only seen by the amount of light that I can make shine.

This basically means:
- If I shine really bright, I will be able to see much clearer all the things
- If I don't have much brightness, I will see much more shadows

In this way we can understand that **the world around us is just a projection of our own light**.

---

## Devotion in Relationships

### Falling in Love

Through devotion, I will look for that light in things or people that represent that light for me.

I know this might hurt, but it's really weird that we fall in love with someone by true love. Basically what we really do is to fall in love with others by devotion.

- If you fall in love with someone for what you see in the surface of that someone, that's devotion
- If you fall in love with someone because that person has attributes that you don't have and you love them, that's devotion

### Devotion Is Not Wrong

It seems like what I'm saying is that devotion is something wrong, but it's not. It's something natural and it's something that is fine.

Why? Because we are humans and we live in a third dimension and we are divided, projected in many.

To love us, the love really is, we should not be humans, we should be in the universe hesitating between the planets. We should be something really wide and divine.

We are here experiencing different points of view, we are here experiencing different realities.

So it's not that we should leave the devotion and start to love like the divine, because we are humans and we have to learn to love like a human thus.

---

## Devotion as Part of the Process

### Finding Light Through Others

The devotion is part of the process of understanding how to find that light in the world through recognition, through sharing.

The system tells us that we are moving ahead by looking into others, many things that we think that we don't have. But remember: **we are one**. Everyone is only one being divided in many.

When you admire someone, actually you are remembering something that is part of yourself too.

### The Problem: Unconsciousness

The problem is that we do it from the unconscious.

When we do this from the unconscious way, we lose a lot of energy by trying to admire the others.

But when you are aware of this, when you are conscious about this system, actually you are loving different aspects of yourself.

---

## From Devotion to Reflection

### Any Devotion Is Fine

Any person that has a devotion for a religion, for a philosophy, for a person, for whatever, an object—it's doing this process of loving, of devotion, and it's fine.

The only thing is that you have to know:
- If you are willing to reach the light unconsciously, you will do it through devotion
- If you do it through consciousness, you will be just walking around the room enjoying the colors

And until the moment, walking around, we realize that **the origin of the light is myself**.

### Becoming Devoted to Yourself

The moment when I transcend the devotion from the outside and start to be devoted to myself is what in Latin we call **reflection**.

Reflection comes from:
- **Re** = to come back
- **Flexus** = to bend

The concept of thinking about something, to make a reflection of something, is this reflection.

You stop watching outside for the light and you start to see the light within. That's the meaning of when you start to think about things. When you start to not just believe in the things outside, but also to try to understand them by yourself.

---

## Summary

### The Journey of Light

What we usually do in the process of loving is that we are unconscious, looking for this light outside that we call devotion, making the promise to follow something outside. And this is not wrong. This is just a way in which we can relate.

Until we start to become aware, conscious about the system. And we reflect again about the things. So we can start to seek the light within and refer to ourselves, to the insight.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortable. Close your eyes. Concentrate in your breathing. Take a deep breath.

### Massaging the Body

Start to massage all your bodies from your feet to the head softly, massaging, becoming aware of each part of it.

Feet, legs, genitals, waist, back, chest, hands, arms and shoulders, neck, face, and head.

Take a deep breath, put tension in your body, and let it go, relaxing.

### Perceiving the Inner Light

I perceive how a tiny light turns on within my body and it projects a ray of light to the outside. I try to see in which direction it is pointing at.

And I perceive how this ray of light shapes the body, the forms of the beings, the beings and persons that I feel love to, that I am devoted to.

### Recognizing Those I Admire

I perceive these people that I feel they have the light that I can't find in me. I have attributes that I admire and that I don't have.

And I can see the divinities that I admire that have the phase that I can't find in me.

I recognize each one of them. I see those who I love, those who I need, those who I am a fanatic of, those who I admire.

I recognize the light that I can't see in me. And I recognize that all of them are the same.

### Realizing My Own Light

And I recognize that all of them are there only because of this tiny ray of light that comes from me.

It wouldn't be—because of this tiny light emerging from me, I would never have had the opportunity to see the attributes that I admire in them. For I can only admire and love those things that resonate within me.

### Turning On the Light

Take a deep breath, setting this light brighter, bigger, like the rays of the sun. Recognize that power they have.

Breathe deep and deep, turning on this light.

I see how my inner light shines more and more until I cannot see the differences between the people. The beings that I admire, they're all within my own light.

### Weaving the Net

And I radiate this network of light that I am, weaving this net with rays of light that comes from me and come back to me, resonant.

Weaving this net with rays of knowledge that I admire, they're all within me.

Weaving this net with rays of knowledge that I am.

**Ty. Ty. Ty.**

**I am the manifested web. I am the manifested web.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Softly bring this consciousness all around your body, stretching and warming.

Each one at your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Today, notice who or what you are devoted to. What light are you seeking in them?

Ask yourself: "What quality am I admiring in this person that I haven't recognized in myself?"

### Walking Around the Room

Instead of trying to capture the light in others, practice "walking around the room"—observing the beauty that the light reveals, without grasping.

Notice when you're blinding yourself by getting too close, or creating shadow by trying to possess the light.

### Recognizing Your Own Light

When you feel devotion rising—whether to a teacher, a loved one, or a divine figure—pause and reflect:

"This light I see in them is also within me. They are showing me my own reflection."

---

## Week Context

We are in the **Physical Week of Pisces**, where we ground the spiritual and emotional lessons into embodied practice.

Pisces teaches us about unity, connection, and dissolving boundaries. Today's teaching on devotion shows us how we seek connection through projecting our light onto others—and how to bring that light back home to ourselves.

The sacral chakra focus connects us to our creative power and our relational energy. This is where we generate the connections that devotion creates.

## Q&A

### Q: Is devotion to spiritual teachers or masters wrong?

No, it's a natural part of the learning process. The teaching is not to abandon devotion but to become conscious of it. Recognize that the light you see in your teacher is showing you your own potential. Let devotion inspire you to discover your own inner light.

### Q: How do I know if I'm being devoted or codependent?

Devotion is healthy when it inspires growth and connection. Codependency is when you lose yourself in the other, believing they have something you can never have. The key is reflection: Can I recognize this quality within myself too?

### Q: What does it mean to be devoted to myself?

It means turning the energy of devotion inward—making a daily promise to honor your own light, your own truth, your own growth. It's treating yourself with the same dedication you would give to something divine outside yourself.

### Q: If everything is a projection of my own light, does that mean others aren't real?

No. Others are real—they are also light. The teaching is that you can only perceive in others what resonates with something within you. You share the same source light, but in different expressions.

### Q: How do I transition from unconscious to conscious loving?

By practicing reflection—literally stopping to think about what you're experiencing. When you feel devotion, pause and ask: "What is this showing me about myself?" Over time, you'll recognize the light within without needing to seek it only outside.

### Q: Can I still admire people once I recognize my own light?

Yes! Admiration becomes even more beautiful when you recognize it as resonance between two lights. You appreciate their unique expression of the shared light, without feeling you lack something they have.

### Q: What role does devotion play in this 365-day path?

We are all being devoted to the I Am—making a daily promise to show up, to practice, to remember who we are. This devotion is helping us walk around the room, seeing what the light reveals, until we recognize: we are the light.
