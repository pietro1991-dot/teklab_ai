## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. Welcome to all of you to our day of the heart in the mind of Torres. Let 's begin with our topic for today which is abundance.

So let 's go to this topic again. Let 's go to what abundance means. Abundance , what it means , abundance , comes from this forward , Ab meaning out of limits , out of limits , nda , that means wave. And here is missing because you have a sea , but it 's end , which means being and then yeah , that means quality.

So , so abundance means the quality of being out of limits of the waves. The concept basically is when you have water like in a river and the water goes out like it nurses out of the limits.

So that would be the image. The concept idea of abundance is that something that was before on a specific spot or contained in a space , it starts to overflow from it , like starts to go out and imports outside of the edges.

So first of all , let 's go into what is for us abundance.

So first of all , let 's understand the idea of abundance according to ourselves to our times today. We usually relate abundance with the idea of having a lot of things that when I say , I have a very abundant life is that we have many physical things in which we can rely to be safe , to be secure and so on.

So usually in our times we relate abundance with wealth. But the idea of abundance is not specifically about physical things is more about things.

So when we are actually trying to say when we , when we misunderstand the concept of the world , the abundance is accumulation. Accumulation is like the negative aspect of abundance.

So we are going to try to understand what accumulation is.

So we can kind of know in which way we can use abundance in a good way.

So in order to understand this , we will go to the origin of all things as always.

So remember first the key of what we spoke yesterday. Energy energy is the first exchange that we have in the universe. And this exchange at first is done through potentially.

So the energy is a potential that the universe has within. And this potential gets out of itself creating the kinetics , the kinetics , the kinetics , I do n't know how to say it , is the energy that is starts to move from the potential.

So we have seen also that when the universe starts to expand and this energy starts to go everywhere , the universe starts to try to find ways different ways in which they could administrated that energy.

So it can be constant.

So this kinetic potential of the energy can be administrated in different ways. And that 's what we call the law of conservation of energy. Where we have been saying is that this energy is trespassing from the positive and the negative in order to find the constant of this energy.

So it has to transcend itself once and again. That 's why every wave will try to find the positive and negative this way in which it can transcend the energy , every particle , every atom , every molecule , every cell. They will try to pass the energy and exchange the energy in order to find the constant transformation. But in order to do so what they have to do is to ensure that they have the energy to be able to do that transformation.

So in order to get that potential , what we have to , when every particle has to do is to accumulate energy to have that energy within.

So by law of conservation of energy , the universe will tend to find by polarity , the reservoir of energy , like to save energy to conserve the energy.

So this means that from the very finest particle in the universe , everything will tend to at least rate accumulate and save energy.

So the way in which they will save energy is by exchanging energy.

So that 's why they find other particles that rebound with them.

So these particles create an organism , a molecular organism , to storage that energy.

Something that we have to understand is that we are not different from the atoms. The atoms has designed everything that we know , everything that exists even ourselves.

So we have been designed through the atomic realm in order to accumulate energy to save energy. We are like different particles altogether trying to accumulate energy.

So this is why we keep the idea of those atoms. We are not different. From these atoms towards the entire the construction of the universe , these atoms starts to build the organisms that create life and life starts to go through evolution.

So the system of the atoms go through everything until we arrive to the human point of view in which we still accumulate this energy. We accumulate this energy in our mind through beliefs , through ideas. We accumulate emotions through our feelings. We accumulate energy in our actions in our body through eating , sleeping and so on.

So in all nature , everything accumulates like the plants , accumulate the energy of the sun , accumulates the carbon dioxide , they accumulate to make sugars. They , the animals eat and and keep things for some seasons , the humans we accumulate by eating.

So we can have fat in order to have sugars for our survival.

So this is basically how nature does it. We accumulate energy.

So this tradition of accumulation in nature is something that humans we have inherited and how. Because at first time before we were. We were a civilization. We were trying to organize ourselves in families and groups to try to survive.

So throughout our entire history , we have to cite cultures and traditions that kept that need of survival. Which was to accumulate things in case that tomorrow we do n't have them. Food , where , goods. Anything that could be good for us in order to not to suffer tomorrow.

So this has been. This has been through. Like this , through thousands of years. That we have been suffering a lot.

So this. We came at tradition in our bodies. This became. This became a tradition of our bodies and we and sometimes some of us we start to.

Have this need of accumulating things just in case something happens. This is like someone that had lived a war for for sure some some of you may be you know someone that had lived a war. And they tend to accumulate food. Even under the bed.

They tend to to drop things from everywhere and accumulate it in the house just in case something happens in the same way as happened before with a war.

So so this kind of things happens to us because. We have lived. Those kind of situations.

Sometimes sometimes we did n't live it by ourselves , but it is in our. NA.

So they believe. The historical belief of not having things. That believe. Not being able to have the things that you need.

It 's created. The concept of accumulation. As a way to survive.

So that 's what many people are living to accumulate things. In order to survive.

So through thousands of years. We. We have seen and we we can see that that the people on the stood that the that the ones that we 're able to accumulate things. To have a lot of things they had much more possibilities to survive.

So if you have many things. You can survive. And if you do n't have stuff , you will die very soon.

So this creates the idea that whoever has many things. Is better.

So we have to accumulate things in order to leave longer. This is one of the beauties idea for example in the canon that of beauty that we had in the. After the middle ages in the Renaissance in the Renaissance when you see the portraits of the Renaissance of the the artists. You will see that the women and men are like kind of fat and why the the kind of beauty in that time was the fat person.

Because whoever was fat. And that means that they were eating that they had the possibility to eat.

So the people would fell in love with people that were fat because that means wealth. That 's one of the of the idea that had been creating in our society. The concepts of wealth being accumulating things.

So of course that abundance in history for humans is related to accumulating things in order to. Keep yourself alive.

Some traditions around the world through history. And today mainly today. The concept of abundance has changed. Because today usually most of the people can eat.

In the world. Most of the people can feel safe in the world.

So that 's why many of us started to have the opportunity to think about abundance in a different way which is not about. Getting the things to survive but to have. Things. But to have emotions about thoughts about.

Many of those things. Spiritual abundance.

So we started to have time to. Think about abundance in a different way.

So I know that it 's difficult to get this idea of speaking that we have a different way of abundance. When we. Are talking right now. That there is no hunger in the world as it used to be before.

If we speak about the entire history this is the first time. In the last 100 years. That there are much more people that can eat than the people that can not. It 's the first time it does n't it does n't mean that there is no people.

Living in hunger. There are a lot of people living in hunger. But talking about history. Not thinking about being the good scenario.

Thinking about. History. This is the first time that we do n't need to accumulate in order to survive. There are.

A lot of food in the plant. There are.

So today we have the possibility to go and buy food in different places or get food in different places. I 'm not saying that. There 's no hunger and saying that this the first time that there is less hunger than ever have been in the history of humanity. Because in other moments in our history of humanity.

All the people that we are here talking about this. We would n't be here. We would have been. I do n't know what I 'm doing.

Harvesting or hunting in order to survive.

Now that we are getting another understanding of abundance that we start to understand a different way of abundance. We can understand that abundance is not about accumulation of things in order to survive. That when you look back in history. Our survival as a species was not because of accumulation.

The survival of our species was because of sharing. Sharing. Share is the concept of abundance. Because the main key that makes the difference between these two words is that accumulation means to.

Put a limit on the things that we hold like this is mine and I accumulate this this is my limit. And abundance it 's to go beyond the limits which is. The things that I have they go over me so others can have it too. Is sharing the key of abundance.

So the reason why abundance is about sharing. Is like for example this I have only one pen pencil I have only one pencil.

So if I see another person that. Needs a pencil what I 'm going to do is to break it into so the other one can have a part of it. And when I give the other part of to the other person the community the other people will see my action so eventually someone will give me a new pen.

So it 's not about having a lot of things and having so much that I can share with others. No it 's about having only one thing and even though having the opportunity or the choose the chance to share it.

So abundance it does n't even have to be. With this with an object.

Sometimes what other person needs is a high. Or someone that can listen to it. When we. Realize that we can also share with others things that are not physical.

It opens new ways for me. To be abundant. For example someone that is having hunger. The does n't have any food.

If that person goes to a farmer. And just by itself help the farmer with with something whatever. Maybe the farmer will give some. Seats.

For that person to so. And to create their own food. Or to share a meal. Abundance is not only about exchange of physical things is about sharing.

So abundance. You get abundance by sharing. Thoughts ideas projects. Emotions feelings sensations.

And maybe tiny objects. Abundance is not really with material things is related to the ability of sharing things in between. Being. And that sharing can be in many different ways.

So abundance would be. To take your potential energy from inside and instead of taking for yourself. Share it expanded from your heart. Given it.

Sharing it with others. Making this potential energy into kinetics energy. And we 're doing that. Even if you feel that you have nothing to give to the others.

You will be. Being abundant because the person that you are giving that energy. Will give you energy back and someone else will give you back. And someone else will give you back.

And someone else will give you back. And someone else will give you back. It is human culture. Human culture , human tradition.

That made and and and religious that made. The poor people. The ones that does n't have anything. To believe.

That they need to wait for someone. To save them.

So they do n't have to do anything. But they do n't have to do anything. Is a matter of the culture of the culture that makes us believe that we have to accumulate things and that we have to give. Gave to the others to others in order to save them basically.

It 's basically something. Very cultural to believe that we have to survive ourselves and think that. And thinking that is someone from the outside that has to be in charge of. What happens to others.

Culturally we have created. We have created. Systems institutions. That takes us the responsibility of taking care of the others.

So the institutions like religion. Governments. Economy. They started to take care of the poor people.

Taking the rest of the people that. Responsibility of sharing with the others.

So because society has created this institutions in order to take care of those who are in need. The same institutions that they were created. For to help. They understood something that if they solve the problem.

They do n't have any job. They lose their position.

So in order to take more power and to keep. The work going on. They need to take. Care of these people.

Having them exactly as they were. In order for them to take care of them. This is how the systems that we 're made in order to help. They become the same problem.

Because they start to create. They need.

So they could exist. It 's like if for example.

Someone discovers how to heal all the diseases of the planet. All the doctors. The physicians they disappear. They we do n't have.

Medicine. We do n't have doctors in the world.

So what the people have to do. The doctors do n't have to do. Create disease. If they do n't create disease.

They do n't have job.

So this is exactly. The conflict.

So.

The reason why we have governments. Trying to. Do this job is because we. Humans.

We have not. Being. Thought. How to share.

Because we have no idea how to share. We have been taught in education. For other things. But not to share.

That 's why we believe in an institution like the government. That is there in order to help everyone. That needs.

So we were taught to receive. Not to give. We were taught to receive.

So we depend on a system. And the moment that in which we have to give is called. Taxis , which is like imposed. Imposition.

Is something that is imposed. By someone. And that 's why we have conflicts and revolutions and. Because they are trying to do it.

Because it 's like a dictatorship. The main thing here is. Education. When.

When in education. We are taught to be abundant. We do n't need governments. Because we already know how to share.

The governments are there in order to. Split. The wealth. But we have been so.

Concentrated in trying to. Survive accumulating. Things and money and some.

So many things. That. We have not been. We have not been.

And we do you have not been. We do believed that. That is the best way a firm. By the waters reality.

We do not believe that each is the best way That is the best way. Through the same. We deal. With the crushing.

And also that of life for pay is a ecosystem. The reconstruction there is no big space. Of human society. And I will try to explain it like this.

So basically , the reason why the distribution does n't work is because of why we spoke yesterday. We talk about energy. What is energy? Energy is the strength of the movement of a work that you 're doing.

Energy means work.

So this means that you have one energy inside which is potential. And then you move away outside. We moved in kinetics.

So we are doing a movement with our own potential. There is nothing in the universe that only receives energy without doing anything in exchange. The universe is constantly doing something every atom.

So the idea of distribution of wealth which is distribution of energy can not work unless all the other parts are also doing something. Because if you have a system in which something gives and gives and gives , on the other parts are static , that energy will lose. It goes against the law of conservation of energy. If there are beings or people that are static not doing anything and receiving , it loses the energy.

And this is why all the systems in the governments that have been designed in order to distribute the wealth , they have problems in short term. They will have problems in a few years. Because it 's not constant. It goes against the laws of physics.

This is why we have problems all the time.

So a condense is not given by someone given energy to others. A condense is done. It 's given only by the action of the inner potential being shared with others. It 's not distribution of wealth.

So this can give many other branches branches from this. But we will keep talking about this because this whole month is about kind of the topics that touches from very close today.

So just as an advisor would say , this month is all about rich poor and hunger and all these kind of things. But the main thing in order to understand all the things that will come like this condense , we need to understand perfectly the topics that we spoke in the previous three days. About resonance , energy , because it 's the base to understand the next.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The variation for today is we. The statement for today is I am the origin of the hard. The code for today is that landtick ocean.

## Energy Work

The longest ocean of all extends from north to south in the world contained by Europe , Africa , the Americas and Antarctica. And crossing lengthwise it 's center by an axis that we know as metatlantic rich , a marine mountain range that elevated vision of the lands in the continental drift , living volcanic islands on its way. The ocean is the expression of the universal icosahedron , materialized on its waters and structures being the portal of earth energies in its ascension to heaven. Men!

I become aware of this pace that surrounds me , the body that I inhabit and my own breathing. I use my imagination to think that this pace starts to expand and get darker towards the infinite.

So I find myself levitating in the center of it of this great void.

So hopefully I start to expand my body stretching and carry out all the space around me like a fire dancing. There is love.

Softly in this dance , I start to take fatal position. Hopefully , tagging my legs and becoming a seed. Those who can not move your legs just hard yourself or take your hands. I take a deep breath , I say recognize myself as a seed of the universal tree of the tree of life.

And I observe upon my head. A light that descends towards my body shining on me. As I can see how from this ray of light , a big drop of water ca n't towards me , drop of water and light. And I can feel this drop of water reaching my head in my crown going down to my fur eye.

Going through my throat and descending through my shoulders , back and chest. Going to my lungs and heart , I feel in my heartbeat how the heart is absorbing this drop of water and light. And I can feel in my heartbeat this triumph of the source that rebounds in me with everything in the universe that activates my inner energy and its potential. Being expanded through my heart with all abundance.

I recognize me the energy of abundance of sharing.

So I set intention to open myself to expand my abundance to the world. Let in the world respond to me with abundance. With my hands and my heart , I can start to feel my hands becoming the leaves that get out of the seed. As I open the two continents stretching the legs and my arms , opening the leaves up from my heart to the world and my roots in my feet.

I start to extend my legs as roots to the ground and my arms as branches. With its fingers , the leaves and flowers. And I become like this a new tree of life. Ready to share its fruits with all the world.

I radiate my heart in all directions. I recognize that I am abundant. For everything that I have is within everything that I need is why I have the sound filmắm I 'm the origin of the heartbeat. I am the origin of the heartbeat.

I am the origin of the heartbeat. I have , I have , I have. And what I have bounds in me and I share it with a world. Take a deep breath and each one of its own time.

Come back here and now stretch in your body. Thank you everybody for being here another day and see you tomorrow at the same time.
