## Overview

On January 5th, we explore the Law of Cause and Effect—the fifth Hermetic principle. Matias teaches that **every action creates a consequence.** Nothing happens by accident. Everything is part of a chain reaction that begins with a cause.

This law is often called "karma," but it's more than just "what goes around comes around." It's about understanding that **every cause creates multiple effects**, and those effects become new causes, creating endless chains of consequences.

Matias uses the metaphor of light passing through water and crystal to create a rainbow. The light is pure, but as it passes through different mediums, it distorts and separates into colors. **The original truth becomes many different projections.** This is how cause and effect works—one original action creates many different outcomes, each distorted by the medium it passes through.

---

## Core Teaching

### Everything Has a Cause

The fifth Hermetic law is the Law of Cause and Effect.

**Nothing happens by chance.** Everything that exists has a cause. Every effect comes from a cause.

If you see something happening, it's not random. It's not luck. **It's the result of something that came before it.**

This is the foundation of the universe. **Every action creates a reaction.** Every cause creates an effect.

### The Chain Reaction

But it's more complex than just "one cause, one effect."

**One cause creates many effects.** And those effects become new causes, creating more effects.

It's a chain reaction. An infinite web of causes and effects, all connected.

For example:
- You drop a stone in water (cause).
- It creates ripples (effect).
- The ripples hit the shore and bounce back (new effect).
- The bouncing ripples create new patterns (new effect).
- Those patterns affect the entire pond (new effect).

**One cause. Infinite effects.**

### Karma: Not Punishment, But Consequence

Many people call this law "karma."

But karma is not punishment. **Karma is consequence.**

If you plant a seed (cause), you get a tree (effect). Not because the universe is punishing or rewarding you. **Because that's the natural consequence of planting a seed.**

If you speak with anger (cause), you create conflict (effect). Not because you're being punished. **Because that's the natural consequence of angry words.**

**Karma is not moral. It's mechanical.** It's just cause and effect.

### The Original Truth and the Rainbow

Matias gives a beautiful metaphor to understand how one cause creates many effects:

Imagine pure light—white light. This is the **original truth**, the original cause.

Now, pass that light through water. The light bends. It refracts. It splits into colors.

Pass it through a crystal. The light scatters even more. It creates a rainbow—many colors, many projections.

**But it's still the same light.** The original cause hasn't changed. What changed is the medium it passed through.

**This is cause and effect.** The original truth (the light) is one. But as it passes through different mediums (circumstances, people, cultures, time), it becomes many different effects (the rainbow).

### Distortion: The Medium Changes the Effect

The key insight here is: **the effect depends on the medium.**

The same cause can create different effects depending on what it passes through.

For example:
- The same words spoken to different people create different reactions. Why? Because each person is a different medium. Each person has different patterns, beliefs, wounds.

**The cause (the words) is the same. The effect (the reaction) is different.**

This is distortion. Not in a negative sense. Just in the sense that **the medium shapes the outcome.**

### You Are the Medium

Here's where it gets personal: **You are the medium.**

When something happens to you (a cause), your reaction (the effect) depends on **what's inside you.**

If you are full of fear, you will react with fear.

If you are full of love, you will react with love.

If you are full of old wounds, you will react from those wounds.

**The cause is the same. But your medium—your patterns, your beliefs, your state of consciousness—determines the effect.**

This is why two people can experience the same event and have completely different reactions. **Same cause. Different mediums. Different effects.**

### Taking Responsibility

Understanding cause and effect means taking responsibility.

**You are not a victim of random events.** You are part of a chain of causes and effects.

Sometimes you are the cause. Sometimes you are the effect. Sometimes you are the medium.

**But you always have a role.**

When something happens to you, ask: "What was the cause? How did I contribute to this? What is my role in this chain?"

Not to blame yourself. But to **understand the pattern.** To see the chain clearly.

And when you act, ask: "What effects will this create? What chain am I starting?"

**This is power.** This is conscious creation.

### The Elemental Plane: Builders of Form

The teaching for today is connected to the Elemental plane—the plane of nature spirits.

Elementals are the beings that build the structure of matter. In mythology, they are called elves, dwarves, sprites, sylphs. They are the architects of the physical world.

**Why is this connected to cause and effect?**

Because **the Elemental plane is about manifestation.** It's about taking a cause (an idea, an intention) and creating an effect (a physical form).

When you understand the Elemental plane, you understand that **you are a builder of form.** Every action you take shapes the material world. You are responsible for the manifestation.

**You are the stair to all beings.** You bridge the invisible (cause) and the visible (effect).

### The Stair of All Beings

The statement for today is: **"I Am the Stair of All Beings."**

What does this mean?

It means **you are the bridge between cause and effect.** You are the medium through which causes become effects.

You are not separate from the chain. **You are part of it.** You are the stair that connects one level to the next.

Every being, every soul, every action is part of the same chain. We are all connected through cause and effect.

**When you understand this, you understand unity.** We are not isolated. We are a web of causes and effects, all flowing through each other.

### Breaking the Chain

Can you break the chain of cause and effect?

Yes and no.

**You can't stop the law.** Every cause will create an effect. That's the law.

**But you can change the medium.** You can change yourself—your patterns, your beliefs, your consciousness.

When you change the medium, the effect changes.

**This is freedom.** Not escaping cause and effect, but consciously shaping it.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit comfortably with your spine straight.
2. Place your hand on your solar plexus (below your ribs, above your navel).
3. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Feel the warmth in your solar plexus. This is your power center. This is where you manifest.

2. Take a slow breath in. Feel the energy gathering in your solar plexus.

3. Take a slow breath out. Feel the energy radiating outward.

4. Now, imagine you are holding a sphere of pure white light in your hands. This is the original truth. This is the cause.

5. Watch as this light passes through your body—your solar plexus.

6. Notice: as the light passes through you, it changes. It splits into colors. It becomes a rainbow.

7. This is you as the medium. You are not the light. You are not the rainbow. **You are the bridge between them.**

8. Ask yourself: "What is inside me? What patterns, beliefs, wounds am I carrying?"

9. Notice how those patterns shape the light. How they create the rainbow.

10. Now, imagine clearing the medium. Imagine releasing old patterns, old wounds, old fears.

11. Watch as the light passes through you more clearly. The rainbow becomes brighter, more vibrant.

12. Repeat: **"I Am the Stair of All Beings."**

13. **"I Am the Stair of All Beings."**

14. **"I Am the Stair of All Beings."**

15. Feel yourself as the bridge. You are the medium through which cause becomes effect.

16. You are responsible. You are the builder of form.

17. Take a deep breath. Bring your awareness back to your solar plexus.

18. Feel the power there. Feel the responsibility. Feel the freedom.

19. Now, think of one action you will take today. One cause you will create.

20. Ask: "What effect will this create? What chain am I starting?"

21. Set your intention clearly. Be conscious of the cause you are creating.

### Closing

1. Open your eyes slowly.
2. Remove your hand from your solar plexus.
3. Return to the present moment, aware of your power to create.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Observe the chain of cause and effect in your life. Choose one action you will take today and ask: "What effects will this create?" Trace the chain forward. Then, reflect on something that happened to you recently and ask: "What was the cause? What role did I play?" Practice seeing yourself as part of the chain, not separate from it.

### Applying This Teaching

When something triggers you, pause and ask: "What inside me is creating this reaction?" Remember, the external cause is passing through you (the medium), and your patterns are shaping the effect. If you want a different outcome, change the medium—clear your patterns, heal your wounds, shift your consciousness. You are the stair. You are the builder. You have power.

## Q&A

### Q: What is the Law of Cause and Effect?

The Law of Cause and Effect states that nothing happens by chance. Every action (cause) creates a consequence (effect), and that effect becomes a new cause, creating an endless chain. This is the foundation of how the universe operates—everything is connected through cause and effect.

### Q: Is karma the same as cause and effect?

Yes, but karma is often misunderstood. Karma is not moral punishment or reward. It's simply consequence. If you plant a seed (cause), you get a tree (effect)—not because the universe is judging you, but because that's the natural result. Karma is mechanical, not moral.

### Q: What does the rainbow metaphor teach us?

The rainbow shows how one cause (pure light) creates many effects (colors) as it passes through different mediums (water, crystal). The original truth is one, but it distorts and splits as it moves through different circumstances. This teaches that the same cause can create different effects depending on the medium it passes through.

### Q: What does "you are the medium" mean?

It means that when something happens to you (a cause), your reaction (the effect) is shaped by what's inside you—your patterns, beliefs, wounds, consciousness. Two people can experience the same cause and react completely differently because they are different mediums. You shape the outcome by what you carry inside.

### Q: How do I take responsibility for cause and effect?

Ask yourself two questions: (1) When something happens to you: "What was the cause? What is my role in this chain?" (2) When you act: "What effects will this create? What chain am I starting?" This isn't about blame—it's about seeing the pattern clearly and acting consciously.

### Q: What is the Elemental plane?

The Elemental plane is the level of consciousness connected to nature spirits (elves, dwarves, sprites, sylphs) that build the structure of matter. These beings are the architects of the physical world. When you connect with this plane, you understand that you are a builder of form—responsible for taking causes (intentions) and creating effects (manifestations).

### Q: What does "I Am the Stair of All Beings" mean?

It means you are the bridge between cause and effect. You are the medium through which invisible causes become visible effects. You are not separate from the chain—you are part of it. Every being, every action is connected through this web of causes and effects. You are the stair that connects one level to the next.

### Q: Can I break the chain of cause and effect?

You can't stop the law—every cause will create an effect. But you can change the medium (yourself). When you clear your patterns, heal your wounds, and shift your consciousness, the same cause will create a different effect. You're not escaping cause and effect; you're consciously shaping it. This is freedom.
