## Introduction

Hi everyone , good afternoon , good evening. I 'm just fine , you 're well , all of you. By my side , I 'm here sitting on a pillow trying to process the access of my being. There are so many ways , so different ways in which you can process and I 'm your acts.

But I guess my body found this one. At least I can , I can be seated and speaking with you. Yeah , here.

So , that 's fine. Of course , the problem that I am having in my illness right now is because that part of the body represents to be in the place to be here. And it represents to seat and to find yourself in the correct spot where you are supposed to be. But , so the thing is that the reason is because my body and my soul , so the memory of myself , my memory of my body , has a relation with this place with Egypt since 12,000 years ago.

So it 's been a lot of time , a lot of memory from this place. And even if my soul and my spirit had already worked , my body is like remembering , every time you came here , you suffered. And this place is not like you used to be anymore.

So I do n't want to be here , I do n't want to be here. My body says constantly.

So that 's why I 'm trying to teach my body that this is a new time , that this is different , so it does n't matter. If anyone wants to know more about this thing that I am saying , you can read the blog and there you have more details.

So I told you that I was going to be sharing everything that happened to me.

So , well , this is part of what happened to me.

So I 'm sharing.

## Q&A

So there was a lot of people asking about the blog. What is the blog?

Remember that the blog is Josoy. Red. And it 's weird that you are not being able to , that some people say that they are not being able to get in the blog , because maybe you are writing it wrong , because it 's working. And you find the link in all my social media , you have it here in the videos , also the link is everywhere.

So , so you will find it everywhere. Just looking with my name and Jos , and that 's it.

So today we begin with the physical week Scorpio.

## Energy Work

So today we are related to smell , smell , in the day of the crown.

So just something for we start with smell. And this is concerning to the whole week of the physical aspect.

Remember that we are under Scorpio.

So this means that everything that we are going to talk about in this week will be related to the deeper part of our cells. The deeper part of the cells. There it is inside.

So we are going to see the most ancient information of our inner cells. They all this one.

So yeah , the whole , the oldest information of our body. During this week , every topic we are going to talk about is concerning the oldest and deepest memories that we have within our bodies.

Okay , yeah , the most hidden information from our body. One of the things that I wrote today to understand what we are going to discuss is that the spirit , the spirit is this being that is eternal.

So there is no place for it. There is no time for it. Everything is here and now because the eternity is impossible to describe is everything is together.

So then the spirit goes and expresses it into the soul. And the soul has an origin and a destiny. And it goes taking a path from an origin and a destiny.

So for the soul , everything is kind of like a path through time to make a process of acknowledging. And then we have the body which will be like the notebook where the soul is writing everything that is happening in that path.

So every experience , every feeling , every thought , everything that the soul is having in life is being written in the book of life in the book of the body.

So during all this process , the book is like the heritage that you give to the other ones.

So the next one is to the next generations. And everyone is feeling that with new information.

Remember now that in the universe is the universe.

So it 's one.

So for the universe , everything is only one body. It 's present of in different shapes , different forms , through different times. There is no different bodies for the universe. The universe , the universe , express itself in different ways , but it 's only one body.

Okay , so what we perceive as different lives , as future life , past lives , parallel lives , for the universe it does n't exist. For the universe , everything is one only body.

So also for the universe , there is only one soul. Which is the energy that we call love.

So this energy is the one created everything.

Okay , and remember that this energy is also expressed in different vibrations and frequencies. We spoke that vibrations is related to space and frequency related to time.

So the energy is only one soul expressed in different vibrations and frequencies. This is why we perceive that the universe has thousands of souls and thousand bodies when for the universe is only one.

So to understand how this works in the universe , we should relate with our own body. We say , this is my body , one body. But my body is made up with trillion of us trillion of cells.

So there are trillion of beings creating this body.

So that 's how the universe also works. And the spirit is also only one that we call the essence. Essence means the being that is everything. The being that is the entity that is.

That 's what means essence.

So spirit is the I am. That 's what we sell.

So remember if the spirit is I am.

So the trillion of beings that come from the I am are going to be called I. And I in Latin we say ego.

So we have trillion of ego separated and all of them are reaching for the I am. Like the cells are trying to hold the body. To understand this then we would say that in the same way as myself. But trying to do everything.

So I could be Matthias to exist. Myself and all of us are doing everything to give a sense of meaning for the I am to exist the universe.

Okay. It 's a fractal is the same. And there you can see who was the first one Matthias or the cells. Who was the first one?

The I or the I am. That 's the first. Who was the first one? The I am.

The human or God.

So imagine this that Matthias was n't born at the same time with the cell because Matthias is a product of culture is an idea of culture. That I and others have been leading through time.

So. It was not from the very beginning everything that I am now.

So. Myself were first. Creating me.

So. Matthias is a product of creation of ideas. And it 's not exactly what I am what I really am. The idea and the consciousness , the divinity of the universe.

It 's changing every time that we change also our belief of the universe. In this way , so in our own life. The idea of the universe as the idea of who we are. Is changing constantly according to our growth.

As we grow up , we change the idea of who we are.

So. The real. Information and memory of who we are is written in the cells. Not in the idea of who we are.

I am not speaking now about the origin of the universe. I am speaking now from the point of view of we being alive with the body.

Okay.

So from the point of view of the origin. It 's an idea that creates matter. But one. The matter exists.

It 's the matter that creates the idea. That 's the part of the universe , the constant.

So this means that we being in the body. The only chance that we have is to start to create. With our mind. To start to create with our mind.

Towards the future. Because we can not go to the past to understand the idea. The only way we can arrive to the origin of the idea is if we keep moving forward , creating new ideas , transforming the reality. To become creators.

That 's the paradox of how we reach the origin. What is the easiest way and shortest way to find the origin of who we are. Is by going to the self-memory. The memory of the cells.

That they had all the information of what the soul has lived. And this helps us to understand that the body and soul are not separate things. That the body is a consequence of the soul.

So the only truth of this universe is that there is only one spirit. One soul. And one body that is divided into three lines of beings. Of shapes.

The feeling. The perception of separation between all these beings is only ours. It 's not from the highest being for the universe. This is why we used to say that it 's everywhere.

Not because it 's divided and watching everything from different places. It 's because basically God is everything. Is. By saying this , now we can understand that the whole universe is only one body.

And that every living being , self. And everything that that living being lives is registered.

So. And then is shared with the rest of the cells. This means that all the memory of universe is in matter. The living memory of the divine in the universe.

Is. The master , the body , the physical aspect.

So one of the ways in which cells share memory. Is by synapses like the. Neurons that are cells. That impulse.

Light. Information going all around. Sharing data. In the shape of light.

In Sanskrit , a cache is light. Light is a cache.

So a cache records. Would be. The. Neurosystem of the body.

Where all the data is shared. Hmm. We have two different ways. The neurons.

Since data in shape of light. Going all around the system. And the cells. Is sharing the same data.

But from the shadows. From the dark. And that is what we call. The senses.

The five senses.

So the rest of the cells. Sharing information. In between each other. By pulses.

Electrical pulses. Hmm.

So now we can see that. The universe is sharing constantly information in its body. By light. And by the senses.

Related to this. The two different ways. The light and the darkness. The light.

Is the particles of photons. The photons are the particles that go everywhere. And that creates everything. But then.

There is the distortion of light. And the distortion of light. Is what allows the senses.

So the way in which the light. Perceived itself. Perceived the cause of information. When they are distorted.

Is by senses. Because senses interpret the distortion of this light. That now become darkness.

So senses. The senses. Still. It would be the ways in which the living beings.

Can receive from the darkness. From this distortion. From the darkness. The senses are the tools that we have to receive.

The data from the basic records. In the light. This is why Scorpio reminds us that to see every one of the options of light. We have to get inside the mud.

So this is why Scorpio mind in us. The importance to go to the mud. It 's reminding us that if the universe is about to learn to experience , understand the potentialities that this being had. The basic records.

The light. The only light. It 's always light. There 's no change in the light.

It 's constantly the same.

So the distortion of light. When light is distorted , it creates so many colors , so many shapes , so many forms. That it has so many ways to understand the reality. That this is why in order to learn , you grow to this.

To experience. To have more data.

So a white light that divides itself in the 12 colors of the rainbow gives you much more possibilities to experience the different potentials of a soul. But if you are only white , you do n't have any possibilities to experience that.

So this is why the being distorted itself.

So it could experience. But I have to keep connected to the whole universe to keep sharing information with all the universe.

So the way in which I will do that is by senses. And the five senses will be the tool I will use to keep in touch with all the data of the universe. And the sense that will allow me to perceive the spirit is the smell. The smell is the one that allows me to perceive that spirit.

That in other way I will be able to do it.

The reason why smell is related with the spirit is because of the origin of the word spirit. The word spirit is connected with the concept of respiration. That you can English may say breathing. But respiration also exists.

And this means this comes from Latin. And Latin the word spirit means to blow. And the spirit is to blow back again.

So it would be.

## Guided Meditation

So this means that to breathe. To breathe is the greatest act. Is the greatest spiritual act. This is why we relate the divinity with the divine inspiration.

The contemplation with the one eye. And to exile the creation. To blow of life. The universe is the being that breath.

This means that everything that is breathing connects itself with spiritual world. For example , I do n't know if you have seen this , but there is a video in YouTube maybe you can check it. That is how airs breathe. And you can see the airs breathing when they accelerate the image of winter and spring.

And you see the greens and the sun. It 's breathing.

So the universe that solar system does exactly the same. It expands. Breathe in out. And then all the planets go back through billions of years.

Breathe in in. The galaxy is just this. Two. Through billions of years.

The universe is breathing.

So this is why the universe is a spirit that comes back to it to himself once and again once and again.

So it does n't matter if you can smell the most important thing is that you can breathe to be connected with the spiritual world. And this is why whoever has a problem of breathing , it 's in the crisis of spiritual awakening. This is why the whole world now with the COVID-19 is the threat of not being able to breathe. Because the whole humanity is now in a crisis in an existential crisis , who are we?

What are we doing here? What is the next step? I have no idea what I 'm here. The whole humanity is in a crisis.

## Q&A

So one of the things that I wrote today in the blog that I do n't know if you get it is that I asked to the higher self. If the breathing , if the spirit is the breathing , this means that we create the spirit by breathing. And he said , yes , we create the spirit by breathing. The spirit is feeding and growing by breathing.

## Guided Meditation

So acknowledging that we create and expand the spirit by breathing is then the way in which we can understand the importance of breathing in our life. The way in which we breathe , the way in which we live fully in our bodies.

So we have to live , plant and breathe correctly in order to expand the universe , to expand the spirit , to feel the spirit. I usually recommend to breathe by the nose , only by the nose when we are working with the spirit. Because the nose was designed to breathe , the mouth was designed to eat different.

So now what about smell? Smell is a specific tool that is related with what I explained before. About the body being the notebook where you write everything , all experiences.

So in this notebook you say , today I did this and that. That information written in the notebook. Transit into the spiritual way of thinking of our body. We 'll be related with smell.

So a person that is losing the smell is a person that is losing its spiritual memory. By losing the smell , it does n't mean that this person is not spiritual. It means that that person has lost somehow the memory of its own spirituality. And this means that the body , for example , is receiving a fight against a belief.

Is the 9th or hope is a person denying intuition. And a person with a lot of smell can be a person a very critical person. There 's , as an having a limit. It 's like the spirit.

It 's see everything.

So it can look farther. Each smell is related to a memory of the spirit. This means a memory of having breath. Having sacred.

A breath.

Sorry.

So one of the things that we have to practice now is to pay much more attention to the smells that we feel the most.

Okay. Like what are the smells that you perceive the most? Because there is a lot of information.

So one of the things that you have to do is to practice the smelling. Smell with your eyes closed. Things to practice more deeper.

So for example , this I take a rubber and I smell the rubber and suddenly the smell. It means I 'm weak and exactly. Particular moment in my school. What I 'm sitting against a window in a specific classroom.

And what was happening in that moment. Why I have that particular image. Why rather is related with that particular place.

The reason why we have to practice more to smell is because this particular smell brings us exactly to a specific moment. We 'll help us to awake the information of that moment. It was important for my soul and the spirit. Because I 'm not remembering any other moment and I use robbers time.

So that will help me to practice the connection with my memory.

So remember that smell is the one that by practice helps us to connect with intuition of the spirit. It helps us to become more intuitive. About this I spoke much more in the video related to Rangle.

Okay , so you can see that video. There 's much more about smelling.

So remember that smell helps us to connect much more with information of the spirit. Much more directly with information of the spirit. To have a better communication with it. I know that there were some people that were willing for me to explain directly the smell.

## Daily Practice Elements

But I hope you understand why I had to explain all the previous part. In order to understand smell. The vibration for today is chan. The statement for today is ion , the cosmic emptiness.

The good for today is the conscious expression. When the future originates the present is manifesting reality. The consciousness of the creator who jumps to action with a purpose , Decorated with missions and goals , object creating , Creating by the love that implicated doing it. Generating once own reality.

Becoming conscious of what was answered. This is called the past. For it 's where it can be played with limitations. Take it in breath.

## Energy Work

Take your hands to the top of your head. I 'm from there. It was hard to make a massage , carry this stretching. Each part of the body from the crown to the peach or whatever you can reach.

Technology each part of the body. I bring awareness to the body. Everything that I am doing for it is for its best. And then during this next day 's , I will work just for it.

I take my time to receive each part of my mind. I will work just for it. And then towards the gentle legs. And I shake all of them.

Let 's all wait for them. Imagine the dew find your mouth in the middle of the forest , what a rain forest. Surrounded by thousands of trees with different sizes , with birds insects all around. As I go deeper and deeper inside the rain forest , there are bigger trees.

The taller , shorter ones , the shadows are bigger. Delight can not reach the ground until I get into the darkness. Imagine this big tree , so so big that numbers everything. If I look above , it 's so dark.

But it seems night. Thousands of stars in between the leaves. Because of the sun , I bow. I give close took to the tree and dilute down between the trees.

And I will be able to play to my bow. The branches on the leaves in the shadow. Take a deep breath. And I perceive laying down how my body is getting inside the mud.

Feeling the mud between the fingers. Feet surrounding the legs , shoulders and arms. I feel myself as a root of this tree. I recognize the importance of myself being the root of this tree.

I recognize that this mud , the usually I may think is dirty.

Now , thanks , may feel fresh and secure. Trying to receive all the smells of the rainforest. I can feel the fresh air of the rainforest. Take deep breathing , smelling the wetlands , the mud , the trunk , the trees , birds.

I mean , this tranquility , I feel myself a root in the tree of life. I feel myself a root in the forest. I feel myself a root in the forest. I feel myself a root in the forest.

I feel myself a root in the forest. I am a cosmic void. I am a cosmic void. I am a cosmic void.

I am the universal tree. I recognize that all the smells of this tree contain the intentions of my spirit. Within me , the memory of my spirit is alive. I recognize my breathing is the memory of the divine.

I tell myself to remember the divine that I am to keep you breath. With my two hands , I start to bring this mud , taking a bath of mud , all over the body , covering it with the soul , seminoles. I come back here and now. That I am mud , I am wild and there I am human.

I am a human. Thank you all for being there and for breathing. See you tomorrow , as always. I am the same time.
