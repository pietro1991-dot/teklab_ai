## Overview

We begin the Physical Week of Scorpio, entering a profound exploration of the five senses as gateways to universal information stored in our cells. This week shifts from emotional work to understanding our body as a living library, a "book of life" that records every experience the soul has lived.

Matias shares this teaching while in Egypt, processing deep cellular memories from 12,000 years ago held in his physical body. This personal context illustrates the core teaching: our cells are not products of our ideas—we are products of our cells' accumulated wisdom. The universe is one body with trillions of cells (beings), and we must go into the "mud" to access the deepest information.

Smell connects us to the spirit through breath. As the crown chakra sense, smell awakens spiritual memory written in our cellular notebook, helping us recover intuition and connect with the akashic records that flow through all existence.

## Core Teaching

### The Trinity of Spirit, Soul, and Body

The universe expresses itself through three fundamental aspects that we must understand to grasp our true nature:

**Spirit** is the eternal "I Am"—the unchanging consciousness that has always existed and will always exist. Spirit is the eternal breath of the universe, the constant movement of consciousness breathing in and out through all dimensions.

**Soul** is the path with an origin and a destiny. The soul is not eternal in the same way as spirit; it has a beginning point and travels through experiences toward a specific purpose. The soul is the vehicle of experience, the traveler recording its journey.

**Body** is the notebook, the "book of life" where every experience is written and recorded. The body is not just flesh—it is matter organized to store data, to hold memory, to archive the soul's journey in physical form.

This distinction is crucial: most spiritual traditions teach that we create our bodies with our minds, that our thoughts manifest our physical reality. But the deeper truth is reversed: **we are the product of our cells' ideas, not the cells the product of our ideas.** The cells have accumulated billions of years of wisdom, and we are their latest expression.

### The Universe as One Body

To understand our true place in existence, we must expand our perception dramatically. The universe is not a collection of separate beings floating in empty space. The universe is **one body with trillions of cells**, and each of us is one cell in this cosmic organism.

Just as your human body contains trillions of cells, each with its own consciousness and function, working together to create the unified experience you call "you"—the universe operates the same way. You are not "Matias" or "Sarah" or any individual name in the way you think. You are a cell expressing the universe's need to experience itself in this particular way.

The "Matias" you perceive is not the creator of the cells that make up the body. The cells created Matias through billions of years of accumulated data, evolutionary wisdom, and cosmic programming. The ego—the sense of individual identity—is simply the expression of this cellular collective choosing to experience itself as "one being" for a specific purpose.

This means that **memory is not stored in ideas—memory is stored in cells.** When you try to remember something, you are not accessing mental files; you are asking your cells to share the information they have archived in their physical structure. The cells are the book, and the soul reads this book to understand its path.

### Akashic Records and the Light

The akashic records are often described as a mystical library in another dimension where all knowledge is stored. This is true, but the mechanism is more beautiful and scientific than we usually imagine.

The akashic records are **photons sharing data through light**. Photons are particles of light that travel everywhere, through everything, carrying information from one place to another throughout the entire universe. When photons pass through matter, they interact with particles, share data, and continue traveling.

This means the universe is constantly sharing information through its body via light. The akashic records are not separate from you—they are flowing through you right now as light moves through your cells, your room, your planet, your solar system.

But there is another system complementing the light: **the senses share information through shadows and electrical pulses.** While photons carry data through light and neurons process electrical signals, the senses interpret the distortions of light—what we call "darkness" or "shadow"—to extract even more information.

The senses are the tools living beings use to receive data from the akashic records stored in light and shadows. Each sense specializes in interpreting a different type of distortion, giving us access to different layers of universal memory.

### Senses as the Shadow Information System

Light and senses work as complementary information systems in the universe's body:

**Light (photons)** travels everywhere, sharing pure data, connecting all particles across all dimensions. This is the "bright" information system, the direct transmission of universal knowledge.

**Senses (distortion interpreters)** read the shadows, the bending of light, the way matter disrupts photon flow. This is the "dark" information system, the indirect transmission that gives texture, depth, and specific experience.

When light distorts, it creates colors, shapes, forms—infinite possibilities for experience. A white light that divides itself into the twelve colors of the rainbow gives the soul much more data to experience. If you remain only white light, you cannot experience the richness of distortion.

This is why beings distort themselves—to experience more, to learn more, to gather more data. But to do this and still remain connected to the whole universe, still sharing information with all existence, we use the senses.

The five senses are the tools we use to stay in touch with all the data of the universe while living in distorted form as individual beings.

### The Physical Week: Going into the Mud

Scorpio teaches us that to see every option of light, we must get inside the mud. This metaphor is essential for understanding this week's work.

The "mud" represents the densest, oldest, deepest cellular information—the memories stored not in your conscious mind but in the matter itself. To access this information, you cannot stay clean and elevated in mental concepts. You must lie down in the roots, let the mud cover you, become one with the earth.

This week we work with the five senses specifically because they access the cellular memory that mental work cannot reach. The senses are the bridge between spirit (breath/light) and body (cells/matter), and by deepening our relationship with each sense, we recover data that has been sleeping for thousands of years.

Matias is living this teaching physically: his body is processing trauma from Egypt stored in his cells for 12,000 years. This is not metaphorical. The cells remember, and now the information is surfacing to be integrated.

You do not need to remember Egypt to do this work. Your cells carry information from your ancestors, your past experiences, your soul's journey. By working with your senses this week, you will access that cellular library.

### Smell and the Spirit

Among all five senses, **smell is the one that allows us to perceive the spirit.** Without smell, we could not connect to the spiritual world in this particular way.

The connection between smell and spirit comes from the origin of the word "spirit." In Latin, *spiritus* comes from *spirare*, which means "to breathe" or "to blow." Spirit literally means "the breath."

This reveals a profound truth: **breathing is the greatest spiritual act.** This is why we speak of "divine inspiration" (breathing in the divine), why meditation focuses on breath, why the universe is described as breathing in and out.

Everything that breathes connects itself to the spiritual world. The Earth breathes—you can see this in videos that accelerate images of winter and spring, watching the greens expand and contract. The solar system breathes, expanding and contracting over billions of years. The galaxy breathes. The universe is breathing.

The universe is spirit, returning to itself again and again through the eternal breath.

This means: **it doesn't matter if you can smell. The most important thing is that you can breathe to be connected with the spiritual world.**

Those who have problems breathing are in a spiritual awakening crisis. This is why COVID-19 threatened humanity's breath—the entire species is in an existential crisis: Who are we? What are we doing here? What is the next step? The whole humanity is in crisis, reflected in the lungs.

### Creating Spirit Through Breath

Matias asked his higher self a crucial question: "If the spirit is breathing, does this mean we create the spirit by breathing?"

The answer: **Yes. We create the spirit by breathing. The spirit is feeding and growing by breathing.**

This revelation changes everything. You are not a passive receiver of spirit—you are actively creating and expanding spirit through every breath. The way you breathe, the way you live fully in your body, directly affects the expansion of the universe and the spirit.

Recommendation: Breathe through the nose only when working with spirit. The nose was designed for breathing; the mouth was designed for eating. They have different functions.

### Smell as Spiritual Memory

While breath connects us to spirit generally, **smell is the specific tool related to memory written in the body's notebook.**

Every experience you have is written in your cellular structure. In spiritual terms, that written information is connected to smell. When you smell something, you are reading the spiritual memory archived in your cells.

A person losing their sense of smell is losing their spiritual memory. This doesn't mean they are not spiritual—it means they have somehow lost access to the memory of their own spirituality. The body might be fighting against a virus, or the person might be denying intuition or hope.

A person with a very strong sense of smell can be overly critical, because smell sees everything, can look very far, and becomes hypersensitive to distortion.

**Each smell is related to a memory of having breathed, a sacred breath.** This is why certain smells transport you instantly to specific moments: the smell of rubber might take you to a particular classroom window on a particular day. Why that moment? Because something important for your soul and spirit happened there, and the smell archived it.

### Practicing Smell to Awaken Intuition

The practice is simple but profound: **pay attention to the smells you perceive most, and practice smelling with your eyes closed.**

Take an object—a rubber eraser, a flower, a piece of wood—close your eyes, and smell deeply. Notice what memory arises. Where does this smell take you? What moment appears? What was happening then?

This particular smell brings you to a specific moment because it helps awaken the information from that moment that was important for your soul and spirit. You are not remembering other moments when you used that object—only this one. That specificity contains teaching.

By practicing smell, you strengthen your connection with intuitive memory. You become more intuitive about spirit. You help your body communicate more directly with spiritual information.

## Practice: Tree of Life and Mud Root Integration

This meditation takes you deep into the cellular memory stored in the roots of the Tree of Life. You become a root, lying in the mud, smelling the wetlands and the sacred earth.

### Steps

1. **Body Preparation**  
   Take a deep breath. Bring your hands to the top of your head (crown chakra). Begin a slow massage, stretching and caressing each part of your body from crown to feet, or as far as you can reach.  
   
   As you touch each part, bring awareness to it. Remind your body: "Everything I am doing is for your greatest good. During these next days, I will work just for you."  
   
   Take time to receive each part: arms, torso, back, hips, gentle legs. Shake all parts of your body to release and relax.

2. **Entering the Rainforest**  
   Close your eyes. Imagine you find yourself in the middle of a forest—a rainforest surrounded by thousands of trees of different sizes, with birds and insects all around.  
   
   As you go deeper and deeper inside the rainforest, the trees become bigger and taller. The shadows grow longer. The light can barely reach the ground.  
   
   You enter the darkness.

3. **The Great Tree**  
   Before you stands the biggest tree, so immense it covers everything. When you look above, it is so dark it seems like night, but thousands of stars appear between the leaves—rays of sunlight breaking through like stars in the night sky.  
   
   Bow before this tree. Get close to it. Touch the trunk.

4. **Lying Down Between the Roots**  
   Lie down between the roots of this great tree. Feel the bark, the branches, the leaves above you in shadow.  
   
   Take a deep breath.

5. **Becoming a Root**  
   Perceive your body getting inside the mud. Feel the mud between your fingers, your toes. Feel it surrounding your legs, shoulders, arms.  
   
   You are becoming a root of this tree.

6. **Recognizing Your Importance**  
   Recognize the importance of yourself being a root of this tree. Recognize that this mud—which you might usually think is dirty—now feels fresh and secure.

7. **Smelling the Rainforest**  
   Begin to receive all the smells of the rainforest. Feel the fresh air. Take deep breaths, smelling the wetlands, the mud, the trunk, the trees, the birds.  
   
   In this tranquility, affirm: "I feel myself a root in the Tree of Life."

8. **Affirmation**  
   "I am the cosmic emptiness. I am the cosmic void. I am the universal tree."  
   
   Recognize that all the smells of this tree contain the intentions of your spirit. Within you, the memory of your spirit is alive.  
   
   Recognize: "My breathing is the memory of the divine. I tell myself to remember the divine that I am—to keep breathing."

9. **Mud Bath**  
   With your two hands, bring the mud over your body. Take a bath of mud, covering yourself with the soil and seeds.

10. **Return**  
    Come back here and now. Affirm: "I am mud. I am wild earth. I am human."  
    
    Breathe deeply. Open your eyes when ready.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise: Smell Practice

Several times today, close your eyes and smell specific objects: a piece of fruit, your clothing, soap, wood, paper, anything. Notice what memories arise. Where does each smell take you? Journal about the moments that appear.

### Weekly Focus: Breath Awareness

Throughout this week, practice breathing only through your nose when you remember. Notice how your breath changes when you bring conscious attention to it. Practice slow, deep breathing several times per day, affirming: "My breath creates and expands spirit."

### Living the Teaching

Begin to see your body as a living library, a notebook written by your cells over millions of years. When you feel physical sensations or impulses, ask: "What information is my body sharing with me right now?" Respect the cellular wisdom guiding you.

## Questions & Reflections

**Q: If we are the product of our cells' ideas rather than our cells being the product of our ideas, does this mean we have no free will?**

Not at all. It means your free will operates within the accumulated wisdom of billions of years of cellular evolution. Your cells created the potential for you to make choices; they are the foundation. But what you build on that foundation—that is your unique contribution.

**Q: How can I access cellular memory from past lives or ancient times?**

Through the senses, especially smell and touch this week. The memory is not "in the past"—it is archived in your cells right now. When you lie in the mud during the meditation, you are literally touching the information stored in matter.

**Q: Why does Matias emphasize that the universe is "one body" rather than many separate beings?**

Because separation is an illusion created by perception. Just as your body's trillions of cells create the experience of "one you," all beings in the universe are cells in one cosmic body. Understanding this dissolves the fear of death and the need to compete or control.

**Q: What is the practical difference between spirit, soul, and body?**

Spirit is what never changes—pure consciousness, eternal breath. Soul is what travels and learns—your unique path through experiences. Body is what records everything—the physical archive. All three are necessary; all three are you.

**Q: If breathing creates spirit, what happens when we die and stop breathing?**

Your individual breath stops, but you return to the universal breath. You become part of the larger breathing cycle—the solar system's breath, the galaxy's breath. Nothing is lost; it transforms.

**Q: How can I tell if a smell is showing me something important versus just triggering a random memory?**

The intensity and specificity. If a smell takes you to one very specific moment out of hundreds of times you've smelled that thing, pay attention. That specificity indicates the memory holds information your spirit needs you to integrate now.

**Q: What if I have a poor sense of smell or can't smell at all?**

Focus on breath. The core teaching is breath connects you to spirit. Smell is one tool for accessing spiritual memory, but breath is the foundation. Also, you can work with the other four senses this week—each offers a different doorway.

**Q: Why is Scorpio's work about "getting into the mud" rather than rising above the physical?**

Because the deepest wisdom is stored in matter, not in elevated mental states. Scorpio teaches that transformation requires going down into the roots, into the cells, into the oldest information. From there, true evolution becomes possible.

## Closing Reflection

Today you have learned that your body is not your servant or your tool—it is your teacher, your library, your connection to billions of years of universal wisdom. The cells that form you carry data from the beginning of creation, and by breathing, touching, smelling, you read this sacred book.

Scorpio's Physical Week invites you to reverse a fundamental assumption: you are not a mind controlling a body. You are a cellular collective expressing itself through an individual awareness. The "you" that you think you are is the newest page in an ancient book, and the more you learn to read the earlier pages, the more you understand your purpose.

Smell is the sense of spirit because it requires breath, and breath is the universe experiencing itself as alive. Every inhale feeds the spirit; every exhale creates the world. In this rhythm, you are both eternal and temporary, both individual and universal, both the cell and the body.

Go into the mud. Lie down in the roots. Let the wetlands cover you. There, in the darkness, you will smell the sacred—the memory of the divine that you are.

*When the future originates the present, reality is manifesting. The consciousness of the creator jumps to action with purpose, decorated with missions and goals, creating objects, creating by the love that is implicit in doing it, generating one's own reality, becoming conscious of what was answered. This is called the past, for it's where we can play with limitations.*
