## Introduction

So today we have been the entire day working organized in everything for what we are going to do in this next week. And we have been working a lot in organizing all this , which is for the past , this , of course , there are things that we are doing for the group. During the trip that we are going to do next week , but also our work for the energy-tickle pattern that we are using , we are going to do.

So sorry , but I 'm going to be this day very like this in information.

So because I have my head in this , in this things for this days. We do n't have the kind of here , but we will have to do something with the kind of eventually. We are always sharing screen that now we are here , so we have to do something.

So the topic for today is , the muscular system. The muscular system. Of course , that in the post I explained a lot of the details regarding the muscular system. But even though I do n't want to get in the specifics of the biological aspects of.

Of this system , but I would like to go into the conceptual aspect of this system.

So before we start , I would like to say something which is that tomorrow we begin with mercury retrograde. And this would mean that for sure you are noticing that because I 'm already getting in the mood of retrograde. I 'm not explaining myself very well as usual. I 'm getting lost in the points.

I 'm missing the communication or the translations.

So when mercury is retrograde , all the communications are very difficult. And even more the next days , the next weeks , we will have this changes on the time of the of the linemen. I will try to make it shorter because we wo n't have the entire time to do so.

So it would be weird.

So I have politicized and advised in advance for this because for sure it will be much more difficult to understand me or to keep following when I 'm saying.

So this is because maybe you wo n't be able to understand me better and of course , by my side , I 'm not going to be really the best one explaining maybe during this days.

So mercury retrograde will be until June 22nd.

So we will have a few weeks with a very bad understanding.

## Q&A

So terrible. For those who ask what is mercury retrograde , just to explain you the image of this , to retrograde is to go backwards. That 's the meaning of the work to go backwards. And this is from our point of view , how we see the planets moving around the sun.

When you see the sun in the center , the planets go around. And when you look to the planets from our point of view , we will see that the planets move forward in front of the sun.

So they kind of look like they are moving that way. And then when they turn high the sun , it seems from our point of view , it seems that they are walking backwards. Doing the same path but going backwards.

So this is why we perceive that the planet is going backwards in its own path.

So mercury when it goes ahead is talking about communication. And of course when we see the planet going backwards , mercury will represent like the opposite. Like trying to shut up , like having all this misunderstandings and lack of communication.

So of course that in a positive way , if mercury is communication , when it retrograde , it is telling to us that we have to go inside to think about what we are doing , what we were saying.

So it 's not about communicating towards the outside is about to think and to speak with yourself within.

So I would recommend you to take a benefit from this 20 days ahead to think about what we are going to say , what we communicate , what we express.

So we can pay attention to that and not to make any mistake , what we communicate. To begin with the muscular system , I just want to talk about the etymology of the word muscle because. When we say muscle , we usually think about strong and potential and strength , but it is so funny. And so tender to see that muscle really means little mouse.

Little mouse.

So it 's funny because in Latin , muscular is mouse. And ello is tiny.

So museo. Muscle is tiny mouse.

So I think that is good to know , but it 's not because for the Latin people in their cultures , it was a common way to call the muscles like this because when you move the muscles , it seems like it. And because if under the skin , there 's like a tiny rat on tiny mouse that is moving from one side to another.

So that 's why they call it like this museo.

So the muscular system is. It 's very important for the body to keep the temperature to hold all the organs to make a structure for it to be still. But mainly this system is about movement.

So the important part of this system is movement. Why the movement? How the movement begins in life.

So we have to remember that in the first structures of life , the first uniciliar beings , even if they are recreate or evocaryate , the evocaryate , they will be uniciliar beings that are moved by the outside.

So the environment , they live in water , they live in the oceans , the seas , the rivers.

So these beings themselves , they are moved by the environment from one side to another.

So they depend on the tides. Because if these sometimes the tides and also the currents of the water take them away from their source of food , from their source of light or heat.

So this is why some of them had to move again to their source of nutrients. The appropriate cells usually they extended part of their skin to create like a tiny tail that moves in spiral.

So it allows them to move back to the places or to move towards the places of food or light.

So this is how this main cells starts to move in the space deciding where to go. The eukaryotes cells , they will be much more complex. They start to divide and to specify different cells that are able to move the entire structure.

So they could reach the spots of nutrients or light.

So that 's how we can have for example the How do you call this? Medusa , water , jelly , water. I do n't know the name , jellyfish. Thank you.

The jellyfish.

So thank you.

So the jellyfish , like one of the first beings on having this movement of the cells allowing them to move in the space.

Okay.

So this is the beginning of the muscle system , which is the movement.

So of course that through thousands of years of evolution many beings started to design different ways of movement until some of them created some animals created the bones. Through the bones the muscles started to specify in different structures in different ways.

So it divided into many specified muscles until for example a human that can have 650 muscles in our bodies.

So allowing us to move a very complex structure.

So the fascinating way in which we can understand how they move because something that we take as known , something that we take as common in our days like talking like moving the hands. And doing everything that we do normally with our bodies , we do n't usually think about how complex and specific it is every one of the movements. Because the way in which we are able to move the body is because the cells of the body , the cells of the muscles , they are made of proteins of two kind of proteins that they can try to or extend according to electrical pulses. Those electrical pulses are received through the nervous system.

So the nerves and mid sense of signal of electricity like if you are doing like this to something , you see that electricity contracts , the bodies , the things.

So they are sending tiny little signals of electricity that contracts or extend these proteins , which makes that the muscles can contract or extend the entire muscle.

So when you contract the muscle that , how to say , tendon , the tendon , they pull the bones so you can move it.

So the reason why you move everything is basically because of electricity from your brain , pushing every moment , every instant by electrical pulses , each one of the cells in your brain. It is amazing. If you think about it , it is incredible how the brain received the signal from the five senses. It interprets the entire environment and from that it , like a computer , it sends precisely to each cell of the body.

What to move in which direction , with which strength we have to do it , so it is incredible that something that we do n't even think about needs so much energy and electricity all the time.

So it 's amazing , it 's incredible.

So we have nerve system , a nerve , a neurons that are telling our body , our muscles , what to do every time , all the time , the brain is saying to the muscles , what to do , how to move and everything.

So we have three kinds of muscles. The first one are the smooth , the smooth muscle system , the leopard , neocardium , which is the heart and the strip that is the one rated to the skeleton.

So the first one , the smooth , is the one that is surrounding the organs inside.

So they push the organs to make the digestion to do all the things that we can not control. That you do n't have the will to control it. Ask the neocardium , which is the heart that it 's between 60 to 100 times per minute.

So they moved constantly and we do n't have any control with our mind upon them.

So they are muscles that work by themselves. We 're seeing the signals from our brain and then third one , this three of the skeleton one is the main structure is the whole structure that we have that we know as muscle and that we can control in our movement , the one that we are able to control somehow.

So for sure , we can think that it 's amazing. That is amazing how the heart can be moved by itself and you do n't have to control it. But for me , what it 's much more incredible is how you can with your own mind decide what to do with the movement of your hands to decide this. That I am doing here.

How the pulses of my brain are telling exactly which movement and how to do it to my hand. This is incredible. This is so fascinating. The just electrical pulses can precisely tell the muscles how to move in which strength is incredible.

So I know that this is sometimes that we do n't really think about. This are moments like this when you think about it in a philosophical way or maybe taking drugs. There 's the only two ways in which you can feel so wonder. I 'm used by by these movements.

But I guess it 's important to have this realization of how perfect is this machine that we live in that we are.

So but now besides this , I wanted to take these concepts into the mental idea of the universe and how we live in our life. Normally , as a civilization.

So when we think about the earth , for example , as a living being , we can understand that every living being that is inside the earth is like a cell within that body.

So if we try to find the muscle system in our body , the earth , we will find that between the 40 to the 50 % of the weight of the cells of this body are the muscles. Between the 40 to the 50 % of our cells are in our flesh , in our muscles.

So it 's the weight almost 50 % of our weight is muscles.

So think about that half percent of all the living beings in this planet are related to the muscle system.

So if we think of the muscle system being every cell in our body , in our body of the earth , we can think that half of the living beings in the planet are being that like the muscles are just contracting or expanding creating movement. But they can not know not even the side where to move to or why they are moving. Because those decisions are taken by a tiny group of cells that we call the neurons.

So almost the 50 % of the living beings of the planet are moving because the 5 % of the cells of the body are telling them where to and why.

So we can understand here that exactly as our body is the factorization of the universe.

So inside of our body.

So in earth and in our universe , we have around 50 % of our structure that all these beings that are part of the muscular system of the reality are just contracting and expanding generation. Energy , heat , movement , but not being able to decide why and where to. When we take this concept into our society , we can relate that maybe all of us , this cells that we are living here , we are like muscles , muscle cells. We are controlled by 1 % of cells that decides and know what to do and we are just controlling them.

For sure that the people that is here , a few of you , can relate this with many videos and YouTube about conspiracy theories.

So we are all being oppressed by the 1 % of people that are in charge. And yeah , so think about it. Is n't this exactly as the muscle system , called by the neurons. Think about this.

In our cultures of humanity , we are looking for freedom and we say we want to set ourselves free. We do n't want them to be controlling us.

So we are fighting to release this power to set ourselves free , but it would be a problem. Because when we do that , suddenly the muscles do n't know what to do. They fall down. They do n't have strength.

They can not work anymore.

So we die. We ca n't move. Let 's do this exercise. Think that you are a cell in the body , in your muscles , you are a cell in muscles.

And you are moving your generates in energy , but because you are receiving a signal and electrical pulse from the neurons.

So suddenly some of the cells in the muscles start to say , hey , we are not leaving our lives as we would like to because we are being controlled by the nervous system.

So every one of the cells in the body starts to say , we have to set ourselves free from the nervous system.

So we have to cut it. We have to set ourselves free from this.

So what is the option? If the brain is the one ruling and we and the body say the ones from above are controlling the ones below. Because they are in head.

So we have to cut the connection with them. We have to get away from them and release this power.

So do you know how to disconnect them? The way you disconnect the brain with the muscles is through here in the Atlas.

So it 's a heat here like this that disconnect the cerebellar behind with the spine.

So when you disconnect this all the body is free from the nervous system , but you also can move anymore. You 're a vegetable. You can do anything. You do n't have any pulse.

You can move. Think about that for a moment. Let 's talk about it.

So here we arrived to the concept of the mistake that we usually do , which is very understandable with the money with the concept of money. When we see this system , we start to ask ourselves why how can we get rid of this system of oppression and control. And the reason and the reality is that we can not because the system works like this in entire universe. It works like that.

So it 's not the system , the problem. The problem is who is ruling the system? It 's not about the rate of that 101 %. It 's about who is in charge of that 1 %.

So this is exactly the same mistake we do with money. A lot of people say the problem of humanity is money. No money does n't have any problem. The problem is the value and expectation that we put in money.

It 's not the money. It 's what we believe about money. The problem. The same thing happened with that 1 % of humanity.

It 's not a problem that 1 % the problem is what are they doing with that 1 %.

So the conflict that we have here is not that there is a 1 % ruling. Is that we started to think about everything , separate it. We as humanity divided the entire body saying that this is your problem , this is my problem.

So we started to divide the whole thing. Given the responsibility of something to someone else , believing that we do n't have anything to do with that action.

So the brain start to think about just the brain , the muscles think only about the muscles. Like if we are not part of the same thing. When we start to think that we are part of something and that what I am doing is a part of the whole.

So I know that I can not do all the tasks by myself that I need a team. And we start to work as one. Working for the whole thing.

So important to see in this way , we are a team. Biology teaches that we are a team that every part of the cells , every cell , every organ is unique in its own way. But they are all working for the entire thing. And not because they are equal because they respect the integrity of each one of them.

I know my potential.

So I can expand myself and make the others grow with myself with me.

So we are all one growing in our own potential. What we do in our society is blaming someone for something that is wrong. And we start to fight in the same system. We have to see this as a team.

When we perceive our social body as something that is separated from one thing to another , we will still have all these conflicts.

So I would recommend you , I would invite you to make this reflection of the topic conspiracy theories. All these conspiracies that makes us think about their percentage of humanity that is controlling the rest of us. And I would recommend you to stop thinking into conspiracies , blaming another one for something that is happening to us. To stop thinking that there is someone that controls us and people that is controlled.

And question ourselves behind this fight and think as the muscular system. In the system there is always someone that will guide and someone that will be guide and put this strength to move. But if this too do n't trust each other. We have a problem.

So it 's not about a fight between the ones that feel themselves controlled and the ones that think that control. It 's about to recognize what can I do with my own inner potential and strength. And from that , how can I manage to help the people I trust to be in that one person? And I will tell you something here for you to be kind of calm.

We will never reach the perfect system. Is n't possible because homeostasis , the process of balance of harmony is something that we need to manage every day. It 's not that you reach the perfect thing and suddenly you say , oh , that 's it. And you do n't do anything else.

It 's something that we have to transform every day. You mentioned that you are looking for perfection and you found this perfection in a song. You find this music and you have the perfect harmony and it 's so perfect that somebody became silence. Because you do n't have a story to tell.

You do n't have anything to move.

So suddenly you were looking for the best song and you found silence. What do we do? Can you get now that the reality is basically as muscles with neurons. And they need to work together in order to find the balance that if we are wondering for a system of balance , where only the muscle cells controlled everything that 's called death and silence.

In this life , for sure , we are not going to be able to see the result of the weighting. We are a humanity that are in the process of awakening.

So we are still asleep trying to wake up , trying to transform ourselves.

So do n't expect to leave the perfection in this life. But at least put everything that you have in to see at least one neuron waking up. In the meantime , as a muscle would say , let 's work on it. The vibration for today is cool.
