## Introduction

Hi everyone , morning , good afternoon , good evening , how are you? Welcome to all of you to this day which is the 100 day.

So of our MF.

So we have been 300 days in a row sharing this path of the self. 300 days. We only have 65 days ahead to finish this part of the trip.

So it 's nothing compared to the 300 that we have done until now.

So really I appreciate all of you who have been since the very beginning that has been with me 300 days all the time.

So thank you , thank you very much to all of you. Thank you all of you for these 300 days that we have been together that you had to stand for this bilingual classes every day. English and Spanish and waited for your language. And of course , have been to support every one of my emotions during this path.

Being sick , feeling happy , feeling sad , feeling tired , crying and all this kind of emotions and sensations in which I have felt during this path.

So thank you all of you for having been every day supporting me here.

So let 's see how we take the next two months that we have ahead , still which are Gemini and Cancer.

So we close today with the torus we finished our month of torus. I hope that all of you have been comfortable with the month of torus. How have you lived torus? I hope that it has been a wonderful month for all of you.

## Q&A

For those who are following the task , what we are going to do this day is to water the seats for the last time because it does n't matter which size they are today we have to eat them. We have to assimilate these plants after today. It does n't matter if they are tiny , which has to eat it to assimilate it within.

So I remind you , we have to eat them because the work for this month was to assimilate all the information that we have put into the water.

So we put the water on the plant , the plant was growing , having the potential that we are manifesting all together as one and then we eat it.

So if we are not able to eat them , so we have to work in ourselves the touched that we have. Each one according to its own time of your path.

So whenever you are ready , tomorrow you can sew many more. Let 's begin with our topic for today which is the nervous system. The nervous system is something amazing , it 's incredible. It 's like the most beautiful thing you can possibly understand.

It has so much data , so many things to understand about what it represents. That it would take a long time , so today we are going to just have an idea of how it is and how it works. But basically when you start to think about how it works , it 's like kind of seeing how the divinity is manifesting in front of you is something incredible , amazing.

So there is nothing in which you can possibly think of , since just taking a breath or design a bill that is not controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system touches everything , everything that you could possibly imagine or do. It 's of the nervous system.

So when we start to understand it , it 's amazing.

So they I took a while before we started to make the drawings of the system.

So I could have precise the data that I wanted to share.

So item is anything and you can view the whole concept. And then we will go into the concept of this system. Once we understood the physical aspect of it , we will go into the concept of this system that gives us for us to understand the concept of what it makes us be what we are.

So I hope you are already to go deep into the nervous system.

So the nervous system starts way in the past when we are just a gamut , time itself in the end of the adventure inside the womb of our mother in the first weeks of being just stated. Because what happens is that when the cells starts to divide and create the first structure of our living being , the cells starts to send data and information to one to each one of the cells.

So we can receive them all this information and storage this information to send signals to the other cells , the new cells for them to order in organs , creates in the organism. During this process , it starts to be created all the neurons inside of us in the first weeks.

So through all this process , this cells specialized in storage information data and sharing data and information. This cells starts to evolve in something that we call neurons.

So the neurons be the specialized cells that will be in charge to administrated and to communicate the data inside within our butt.

So from the 7 week of gestation , every minute is produced in our bodies 250,000 neurons within.

So 250,000 neurons per minute for at least 5 to 6 months after during this gestation , imagine the quantity of neurons that we have in the moment we are born. From the moment we are born , we have millions of neurons in our body.

So one of the incredible things about the neurons is that they do n't die. And by that I mean that they do n't reproduce like the other cells. They do n't divide by metosys or meiosis. They are constantly the same.

Until just a few years ago , people used to believe that the same amount of neurons that we have at the moment we were born are the same amount of neurons with which we die. Because they do n't reproduce. They are always the same. They live with us along the entire life.

So within ourselves within our bodies , we have still today , now , until our 90 years old , we will have the same neurons from the very moment of our gestation.

So the first cells that were created are still living within us.

So it 's amazing.

So what they discovered in the last years is that we produced neurons even until the moment we die. But they are very different from the rest of the cells. Because they do n't die because they live on. They do n't reproduce.

They do n't divide the knowledge. They storage the knowledge. And that 's what we call memory. Memory is the storage of data of a cell.

So the neurons storage the data along the entire history of the body. And this why we have memory.

So these tiny cells , some of them are very , very tiny. And the others are very , very long connecting different loan parts of the body.

So they connect one another , creating a network that goes through every one of the cells along the body. And that 's what give birth to what we call the nervous system.

So the nervous system is the network of neurons of cells that are called neurons that share data information along the entire body. This system of network of neurons. They start to specialize in different aspects and attributes or systems.

So that 's why they divide the specialized in different parts that are the different branches of the nervous system. And that 's what we are going to see from the tiny part to the bigger part.

So take a deep breath. Let 's go into this.

So today I have a care of drawings here. I hope you can see it.

So this here is a neurons here. And this part here can be very , very , very , very long for a very short.

## Energy Work

So as you can see here , I do n't know. As you guys see here , a neuron is like a tree. It has roots. It has trunk and has branches with its roots in the center.

So you can remember it the shape.

So we can compare this with the bigger picture. Every tree in the planet , every plant in the planet , is like a neuron. A neuron that connects through the roots and branches with other trees and plants around sharing data information in a bigger mind , which is the living being that we call planet Earth.

So here we have in the center a cell. The core of a cell inside the nucleus of the cell , the cita-plazone , mitochondria and all the different parts of a cell that we have already spoken to all the data of the cell and then it 's surrounded by something called the axon , which is like a channel that brings the data from the cell to the other cells around through the different paths.

Okay?

So from the axon , it goes to other neurons through a trunk of melee , which is kind of like you can imagine like this that this is like a train with different different wagons.

So they push and move the vibration to the other cells.

So how it takes the information to other cells.

So this here , this train can send per second , even 50 data , 50 pulses of information per second , very fast.

So this 50 data , this 50 pulses per second are moving here at 360 kilometers per hour , each one of those 50.

So it 's the same amount of speed that you need for a bare plane to take off.

So it 's so much speed that we can even ca n't process that. It 's huge.

So you can imagine this a train that goes at 360 kilometers per hour of speed from one station to another station and in one second can make 50 trips. Very fast , is n't it?

Okay. Every time the train arrives to one station , it passes the charges that it has on every one each wagon to the next train to go to the other station.

So it 's like transporting data from one train to another to keep going.

Okay.

So now you see this spot here that there is the connection to the next station.

So if we amplify the image here , we will see that this here , this connection here , is like this. This is the charge that comes from the pulse and it goes to the other train to keep going.

So this process here , the transfer from this charge to this other charge is what we call synapses.

Okay.

Okay.

So remember , these are not bones.

Okay. This is not a bone. This is the tip of the branches that we call in the neurons we call dendritic , dendritic or whatever.

So this branches here , the dendritic , they connect one another in the tips by a process called synapses.

So synapses means the action of touching the other one.

Okay.

So this is this action to touching the other.

So now how from the action this station is moved from one spot to another. The waiting which they will move is because this train works by magnetic rails. We have two rails , one negative , the other one positive.

So we have the two rails on a way and the train.

So if we have all positive negative positive negative like this , like , explain , aligned.

So the train will be nothing is moving. But if a magnet switches the magnetism , it changes the polarity , suddenly they will start to repel one another because we all know how , if you put the same faces of the two magnets , like positive and positive , the magnets will like repel one another. Like they want touch.

So you will see one of them like sliding away from the magnet.

So if you see that image , imagine that the two rails you change the polarity and suddenly the train will try to move forward because escaping the same polarity that it has.

So if it is positive and negative , it will be still. But if you change it to positive , the train will boom , tries to escape.

So the magnets will change the polarity constant like this.

Okay , so the train can move forward.

Okay , so that 's why the information can move through.

So now think about the magnets , the magnet. In order for this to change , we need something that makes it change.

So the magnet will switch the change of polarity will be the combination of how to say this.

Sodium and potassium. Potassium is okay.

Sodium and potassium.

So these two will change the amount of electrons that they have.

So they will like still electrons from one another. And one of them will have a lack of electrons.

So maybe have more positive or more negative.

So when they steal to one another , this electrons from the molecules , the polarity of train will change of the range will change.

So the interaction of these two is the one that helps the perfect movement of data of information here.

So that 's why it 's good to have a rich diet in potassium sodium.

Okay , so it helps you to bring information to all your body faster and in a better way.

So the magnets that will make that the train can move bring it information will be through the action will be the magnets of potassium and sodium.

Okay.

So look at this , what it generates here a wave of information , a wave of vibration and energy that we have spoken so many times.

So this wave will determine the information according to the frequency. The frequency if it is as high speed , low speed , frequency , low frequency , high frequency , it will determine the kind of information. Like if we have remember the white light , according to the frequency of the wavelength , you will have colors.

So you will understand different colors through the different frequencies.

So depending on the speed of this , you will have one data or another.

Okay , perfect.

So these different wavelengths of vibration , they will determine the shape of certain molecules. These things here , the red dots here , are different molecules that will be determined. The shape of them will be determined because of this wavelength. And that 's a chemical reaction.

They created a chemical reaction creating what we call neurotransmitter that are these molecules that transmit atoms from one neuron to another.

So one of them will have these kind of bags where the molecules that were formed will be storage and the other one will have these kind of arms that are receptors that will receive these molecules in a possible synapses.

So we can say for example that these neurotransmitter are like kind of books where in shape of chemicals are storage in the information.

So the other one can read them. It 's like sending an email a book to be reading. To be read.

Sorry.

Okay.

So these neurotransmitter will be called like for example with names like Endorphin in charge of meeting information of happiness or dopamine in charge of bringing information of quiet trying to be still okay.

So this means that everything that we can feel that we can do that we can imagine. Anything from love till just running will be connected and able to exist because of this chemical electrical reaction.

So all these systems of neurons will be divided in two groups. Physically the central shaping the brain , the cerebellar , the trunk , the spine , sorry the marrow , the spinal cord and of course we have the perifaric which will be all this kind of nerves then we 'll go to every one of the organs , everyone of the cells.

So all these perifaric system with all these nerves and all these neurons till the very end they will receive data through pulses through the five senses. We have spoken about the five senses.

So the five senses will be the pulses received by the perifaric system that are brought to the marrow , to the brain , to interpret that information through the network of neurons creating these transmissions constantly to interpret the data through the frequency of the movement and in that way it creates an answer to answer back.

So for example if you are feeling the heat of fire it goes to the brain , the heat of fire and the body will turn back very fast so you take the hand away from the fire.

So basically the neurons will storage information.

So every time we receive a signal from the outside they will start to share data.

So they say I have an answer that is similar to this concept that is situation.

So they share the data and this is why we can have the same response and answer to many different situations.

So this same system the central perifaric will divide into two ways of interpreting the nervous system through the somatic and the autonomous system.

So the somatic will be the one that our brain can generate can think about and say I want to move I want to do this or that.

So is the one that the brain decides for example this moving my hand like this what I am saying the words that I am choosing.

So the somatic is the part that my brain decides in how to move the body.

So the somatic depends on my own wheel. This is why is the voluntary system.

So then we have the autonomous system. The autonomous system is the one that we do n't have to think about that we do n't have any wheel. It 's impossible to control this system because the autonomous system of the the autonomous nerve system is the one that controls the heartbeat the reproduction of cells the digestive system all the things that work with them the immunological system we do n't have any wheel under is the involuntary system. We do n't have a wheel upon it and the autonomous system divides in two actions.

One is called the parasympatic and the other one is called the somatic or the parasympatic or sympathetic I do n't how you say it exactly in English.

So the parasympatic and the somatic will be will be in charge of the contraction or the relaxation of the system.

So the parasympatic is the one in charge of relaxing the system the parasympatic will be the one relaxing system and the sympathetic will be the one contracting the system.

So it 's involuntary we do n't we do n't handle them. It 's like going to be or holding the piece is kind of this way in which we can difference this too.

Okay so I think that I explained most of it this is as much as I can explain.

So if you want to know more look for it.

So this is basically the nervous system and as you see it you will understand here that it 's perfection defines what we are the beam that we are.

So we have seen here that we usually call this the spirit. We want to find the spirit in all this. We used to say that the spirit is vibration is the wave of sound of vibration that exists in the universe.

So as you have seen here the mind of the universe the mind of the cosmos is this waves that we have seen here that are moving through all the system.

So when you see these connections of the spirit the mind by polities you can start to understand that this is creation energy which energy the energy that we call ATP the other name remember is the molecules that are created in the cell to storage energy to share and exchange with other cells. We have spoken about this.

So this is what creates molecules that will turn into neurotransmitter which will be the key of movement and movement is soul. Movement is soul.

So we can understand this because these neurotransmitter are the ones allowing us to feel feel , to feel emotions related to the soul , the soul is movement. Through this system the nervous system we can understand that all the things are only one thing. On the one being the body can only perceive reality because of the energy of the soul and the vibration of the spirit they are not different things. There are the same.

When we understand this we will see that the body the soul the spirit are the same and the body can not leave can not exist or express unless the energy of the soul is moved and the energy of the soul can not exist unless the vibration of the spirit moves through transmitting information.

So the whole thing is what creates the being but this is all possible because they connect to one another because they does synapses , they do synapses. They make a network without a network the being does n't exist. The universal mind , the divine God and creator that we call the one can not recognize itself as the one until it can express itself as two by polarity. Polarity is basically just the constant movement of sharing the idea of who I am.

There is no being in the universe unless there is an exchange of data of who that being is. There is no understanding of the one without the two. The only reason why a being exists is because there is a subject , an agent and an action. It is because it exists and I and I.

Usually when we think about ourselves our bodies , we think that this is like this connected from the everything like we are here and this is the body and it has to be something beyond something bigger there that should be something bigger , that creator. But something that is impossible to touch to feel , to grasp , at least to understand it. And that thing that is measurable that you can not hold in Greek is said at Thomas. Atomosts.

So an atom is the concept in the Greek culture to describe something that is impossible to measure. Impossible to count. When we heard this sentence , know yourself and you will know the universe. Go within , mediate and find yourself and find the divinity within you.

It 's not meant to fork. It 's actually real. It is how it is. There is no a creator that created us in perfection.

The creator is created by the same creation. It is creating itself. This is why we are all parts of the creator mind. Our idea of having a creator in the outside is our capacity to see that we are already connected that we are not separated from anything.

And I 'm not saying with this that there 's no God , that there 's no a creator mind. I 'm saying with this that we are part of that God that is creating.

## Daily Practice Elements

Sometimes we do n't have to imagine that there is something much more after the matter. We have to think about matter being so perfect enough to even be able to imagine. This is why know yourself and you will know the universe. The vibration for today is the statement for today is I am an eternal channel.

Code for today , the In-Tigmented System , the skin. Its name comes from Tegu-Mentum , that means coverage in Latin. This means the structure or organ that covers everything else , terminally and inter-insertion parts. It 's the most extensive organ for it covers every part of the body and is in charge of the communication between the external and internal magnum.

In forming the brain about the surroundings it 's in to react accordingly. At the same time protects it from possible threats and allows it to secret inside the excess of liquids , fat or toxins. Let 's see the alienation. Let 's go to the moment.

We are now finally the brain , the eyes , and we concentrate on our breathing. Sit comfortable , close your eyes , and concentrate on your breathing. I teach you the breath , I 'll say become aware of the body that I inhabit. Music I rain my attention with my imagination.

To my feet and from them I become aware of every part of my body going up from my feet to my legs. The hip , waist , hands and arms. And then I am really back and chest shoulders and head. Taking the opposite path , I go from the head to the feet to every muscle and bone.

Starting from this cold and the jaw going down through the spine , the ribs , stern and every bone on the sides of the body from the arms to the legs and the feet. Paying attention to every muscle on them to a good breath. Taking the path again and both , I start to pay attention to the veins and the arterial in my feet going up , feeling the emphatic system and the psycho up. And perceive the reproductive system , adjusted , circulatory , respiratory to the eye and the courage to hand the crime towards the brain and I take it to breath.

I take it to breath and from the brain I become aware of the nervous system. The brain and all the cells called neurons , expanding data to the body through the mind to the spine to every nerve and every neuron along the entire body , sending data , sharing information along and extending network , like light means , spreading around the body. I can perceive the light of the energy moving through the nervous system , reaching the skin , expanding , just light through the discriminatory system , shining. I start to recognize the light of my nervous system by softly and slowly moving and stretching the entire body for a certain information in every movement , like dancing.

I appear to ancient becoming aware of how every movement that I do is an electrical pulse sent by the waves of the spirit , pushing the energy of my soul , the manifest on my body. I recognize that I am doing a constant synapses sharing information. I am an eternal channel. I take a deep breath and relax my body.

And with my sound I start to pronounce the sound of a vibration that awakens the spirit within the channel. And we 'll expand the torus around the physical body. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I have the universe in me. I have the universe in me. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.

I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel. I am the eternal channel.
