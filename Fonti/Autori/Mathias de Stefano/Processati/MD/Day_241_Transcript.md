# Day 241 - What?: The Question That Creates All Possibilities

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Crown
- **Week Theme:** Aries Mental Week
- **Main Topic:** The Question "What?" and Beginning the Month of Aries
- **Vibration:** `Ga`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Universal Vision`
- **Code:** Andromeda - this system is a group of suns and stars that have as background the galaxy with the same name. The expressed conscience in that space usually embodies the meaning of its name from the Greek: protector of men. However, it's Aries Guardian, protector of the beginning of all things.

## Overview

Welcome to the first day of the month of Aries, the last of the three cycles of the Path of I Am. We have completed the Soul cycle (Leo through Scorpio) and the Spirit cycle (Sagittarius through Pisces). Now we begin the Body cycle (Aries through Cancer).

The purpose of this path is not to ascend to another dimension as spiritual beings, but to manifest heaven on Earth—to live fully as soul and spirit here and now in our bodies.

Aries marks the beginning. It is the divine spark that ignites all creation.

## The Atlantean Calendar Structure

### Not Following Conventional Calendars

We do not follow the Gregorian calendar (with its varying 28, 30, 31-day months) nor the astrological calendar (which begins each sign around the 20th of each month).

We follow the Atlantean calendar:
- 12 months of 30 days each
- Plus 5 days out of time
- Related to zodiac concepts (not astrological timing)

### Three Weeks Per Month

Each month is divided into three weeks of 10 days:
1. Mental week (days 1-10)
2. Emotional week (days 11-20)
3. Physical week (days 21-30)

### Ten Days Per Week

Each week corresponds to the chakras:
- Days 1-9: Crown, Third Eye, Throat, Heart, Solar Plexus, Sacral, Root, Knees, Ankles
- Day 10: Toroid (closes the week)

The topics for each day are received intuitively—Matias does not know in advance what each day will bring.

## The Trinity of Fire

### Three Fire Signs

Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius form the Trinity of Fire:
- **Aries**: The spark that ignites the fire
- **Leo**: The fire itself
- **Sagittarius**: The heat and light that expand from the fire

### Three Expressions of Ego

- **Aries**: Internal ego (I am in me)
- **Leo**: External ego (I am in others)
- **Sagittarius**: Expanded ego (I am in everything)

### The Process Cannot Reverse

In our third-dimensional reality bound by time and space, this process cannot go backward:
- You cannot compress heat and light back into fire
- You cannot compress fire back into a spark

For Sagittarius (expanded), returning to Leo (contained) feels like limitation.

For Leo (visible fire), returning to Aries (tiny spark) feels like oppression.

### Perspectives on Each Other

Sagittarius looking at Leo: "Poor thing, still needs to be contained by others. Doesn't know freedom yet."

Leo looking at Aries: "Like a kid, unpredictable, follows no rules, sets sparks everywhere. Impossible to control."

## Understanding Aries

### Not About Personality

When we speak of Aries, we speak of the archetype and concept, not the personality of people born under this sign.

Your sun sign is only one small part of who you are. Your personality is shaped by all your planetary placements.

### The Archetype of Aries

Aries is:
- The divine spark that initiates everything
- The kid trying to find the limits of the universe
- The one who questions to open doors, not to gain knowledge
- The one who breaks limits to see if there's something more beyond

### The Spark Can Create or Destroy

A spark can ignite, creating light and warmth.

A spark can also create fire that burns everything to ashes.

Aries is the initiation energy—the will to begin, to explore, to test boundaries.

---

## Aries and the Ego

### The Leo Perspective

Matias (a Leo) shares his perspective:

"I have no problem with my ego. I use the ego of Leo because my ego is external—it shows the external aspect. If I don't show myself, I wouldn't be able to do my job."

The ego is a tool, not an evil thing to fight against.

### Cultural Misunderstanding

In our culture, we think ego is evil and must be hidden.

But when you don't work with your ego openly, you can't see it properly to use it as a tool.

### The Internal Ego of Aries

Aries watches itself. It doesn't care about the position of others.

If Aries is sleepy, it goes to sleep. It doesn't matter if there are responsibilities or social expectations.

Leo tries to find a political way to be understood by everyone, seeking consensus.

Aries doesn't have that. "I don't care. If I don't like what you said, I will fight."

This is why Aries is related to war, conflict, and the soldier who goes into battle without overthinking.

## The Mental Week of Aries: Questions

### Why Questions?

The Mind week of Aries is about questions, not answers.

Aries questions things constantly—not to gain information (like Gemini or Sagittarius), but simply to question.

Aries is like the kid saying "Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?" until the other person explodes.

### Questions Open Adventures

The energy of Aries questions to open doors, to open different options, to create new adventures.

The goal is not to have the answer. The goal is to keep moving, to keep creating.

When Aries asks someone something, it won't stay for the answer. It will ask the question and then move on to ask someone else.

### Questions Are the Origin

There is no answer without a question.

The question is what pushes us to create the path to find the answer.

Inside every question, you can find all the possibilities of the answer.

---

## The Question "What?"

### Etymology

"What" comes from the European language root and is the same origin as Spanish "Que."

The origin is **quo** in Latin, meaning **object**—a concrete thing.

### What Means Object

"Quo" refers to the object, the thing you are trying to picture.

Every question is asking about a specific topic:
- This how?
- This when?
- This who?
- This what for?

"What" is the concept for every question—it's asking about the object.

### Origin of "Question"

The word "question" comes from **quo** (object) + asking about that topic.

A question means: the topic of this object.

---

## The Practice: Questioning "What"

### The Task for Today

Take a notebook and write down all the questions that start with "What."

Focus on yourself—not external questions like "What is a star?"

Ask:
- What do I believe?
- What do I think?
- What do I see?
- What do I hear?
- What do I say?
- What do I keep silent about?
- What do I feel?
- What am I?
- What do I create?
- What do I have?
- What do I do?
- What am I looking for?

### Only Questions, No Answers

Write only the questions. Do not answer them.

If answers come, that's fine, but the practice is to question, not to answer.

### The Week Ahead

Each day this week, we will explore a different question:
- Day 1 (Crown): What?
- Day 2 (Third Eye): Why?
- Day 3 (Throat): What for?
- Day 4 (Heart): Which?
- And so on...

After all the months of answers and ideas, the time has come to make all the questions possible—to begin this path on Earth.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on your breathing.

### Visualization

Visualize a tiny light upon your head. Visualize its color, its brightness.

Become aware that this tiny light is the spark of your spirit—the one that originates all your realities.

### Crown Chakra

Attract this spark toward you, expanding in your crown.

As you do, make the question: **What do I believe?**

Feel this divine spark descending between your eyes.

### Third Eye

Set your intention to ignite it.

Breathe. When it ignites, make the question: **What do I think?**

### Throat

Take a deep breath and bring this divine spark down to the throat.

Feel it ignite inside the throat.

Make the question: **What do I say?**

### Heart

Breathe and send the divine spark to the heart.

Feel it expanding, coming out through your heart.

Make the question: **What do I feel?**

### Solar Plexus

Descend the spark to your solar plexus.

With every breath, feel it starting to expand and shine in every direction.

Make the question: **What am I?**

### Sacral

Descend this divine spark to the sacral chakra.

Feel it expanding in thousands of sparks of creation.

Make the question: **What do I do?**

### Root

Descend this spark to your root chakra.

Unite this spark toward every direction.

Make the question: **What do I have?**

### Knees

Descend this divine spark to your knees.

Take a breath, igniting the sparks in both knees.

Make the question: **What do I look for?**

### Ankles

Bring this divine spark toward the feet, into your ankles.

Become aware of these sparks igniting, expanding all over the floor from your ankles.

Make the question: **What am I doing?**

### Integration

Become aware that each one of these questions, through this divine spark, opens every one of the doors for the spirit to be here and now.

Expand all these divine sparks through all directions from you, activating the spirit of the beginning, the light, so you can see the universe.

Sound: **Ga**

**I am the vision of the universe. I am the vision of the universe. I am the vision of the universe.**

**I am the question. I am.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Breathe in with all the tension, and breathe out relaxing.

Breathe in again with strength, breathe out releasing the tension.

Each one at your own time, come back here and now.

---

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Throughout today, carry your notebook and write down every "What?" question that arises about yourself:
- What do I really want?
- What am I avoiding?
- What brings me joy?
- What am I creating?

Do not stop to answer. Just question.

### Understanding the Spark

Notice when you feel the spark of Aries in your life:
- The impulse to begin something new
- The urge to break a limit or rule
- The desire to explore without knowing the destination
- The energy that says "Let's just try it and see what happens"

This is the divine spark initiating new realities.

### Working with Your Ego

If you've been hiding or fighting your ego, consider: What if it's a tool?

What would change if you openly acknowledged your ego and used it consciously?

---

## Week Context

We are in the Mental Week of Aries—the week of questions.

This week will challenge everything you think you know by asking you to question it all.

The Mind week is not about finding the right answers. It's about finding the right questions.

Next week, we enter the Emotional Week where we will feel the fire of Aries.

The following week, the Physical Week, we will embody and manifest it.

But first: question everything.

---

## Q&A

### Q: Why do we need to question if we've spent months learning answers?

Because answers without questions become dogma. Questioning keeps us alive, evolving, open. The wise one knows the question is more important than the answer.

### Q: How is Aries different from Gemini and Sagittarius, who also question?

Gemini questions to gather information. Sagittarius questions to gain wisdom. Aries questions just to question—to open doors, not to walk through them.

### Q: If we're starting the Body cycle, why begin with mental questions?

Because we must first question what we believe about the body, reality, manifestation. Mental clarity precedes embodiment.

### Q: What if I don't feel the spark of Aries?

The spark may not be in your sun sign, but it's in your chart somewhere. Also, Aries as a concept is available to everyone—you can access it when you choose to begin something new.

### Q: Why can't the fire process reverse (Sagittarius → Leo → Aries)?

In third-dimensional reality with linear time, expansion cannot compress back. You can conceptually understand it, but you cannot physically reverse evolution back to earlier states without losing what was gained.

### Q: How do I use my ego as a tool instead of fighting it?

Acknowledge it openly. "I have an ego and it serves this purpose." When you can see it clearly, you can use it consciously instead of being used by it unconsciously.

### Q: What's the difference between questioning from the ego versus questioning from the self?

Ego questions to defend itself, to prove its point, to win. Self questions to invite deeper exploration, to create doubt that leads to growth, to open new possibilities.
