## Overview

Welcome to the month of Aquarius! Today marks Day 181, the beginning of a profound journey into the stars, into the constellations, into our galactic identity. We are now connecting with the crown chakra, the portal to heaven, as we begin to understand ourselves not just as earthly beings, but as cosmic citizens connected to a vast network of star systems.

It's important to clarify: We are not following tropical or sidereal astrology right now. We are following the **Atlantean calendar**, which counts 30-day months from the moment the star **Sirius** rises on the horizon. For 2020, this occurred on August 4th, which means our 360-day year runs until July 29th, 2021, followed by five days "out of time" (July 30-August 3). This is why we begin Aquarius today, even though astrologically it may have started a few days ago.

Along this entire month, we will be connecting with the stars, with the constellations, with the skies. We are going to connect with the **vision of the future from the point of view of the aliens**—the beings from other star systems who have been watching us, guiding us, seeding us. We will explore how they see us and how we connect with these stars throughout the galaxy.

The topic for today is **Polaris**, the northern star, also known as the North Star. To understand where we are going (to the stars), we must first understand **where we are**. Polaris helps us find our axis, our orientation in the galaxy. It is the anchor point that allows us to navigate not just on Earth, but in consciousness, helping us recognize our place in the vast cosmic web.

The mantra for this month is **"I Know."** Aquarius is the sign that says, "I know everything. I know this already. I already knew that. I know how this works." Aquarius reminds us that we have the knowledge of the whole cosmos inside of us—the stars within. Everything we will see, we will have to understand with this recognition: "Oh, I know that. Yes, I knew that. Yes, I know that."

## Core Teaching

### Finding the Northern Star

The northern star is the star that the axis of the Earth points toward. Because Earth spins on an axis tilted approximately 23.5 degrees, and because that axis points in a specific direction, we have what we call the "northern star"—the star that appears almost stationary in the northern sky while all other stars seem to rotate around it.

Currently, that star is **Polaris**, located in the constellation **Ursa Minor** (the Little Bear). The reason we have "north" and "south" is because of the **iron in the core of the planet** that points all of it to the positive energy, like a magnet. The energy flows to the north, creating the magnetic field. This is why we have the north.

The constellation Ursa Minor means "the tiny bear." We also have Ursa Major, the bigger bear. But these are names that European people gave because they had bears in their territory. In Africa and the Middle East, this constellation was called **the dog**—specifically, the tail of the dog.

### Why Constellations Exist: Mental Networks

Before we go further into Polaris, let's understand **why a constellation has the shape of a bear or a dog**. We have to go back to Capricorn (the previous month's teaching) and remember that in ancient times, people used to walk around the planet looking for food. They guided themselves by hills, mountains, rivers, shores, trees—geographical markers.

But there was a moment when they started to migrate really far, and they couldn't guide themselves by geography anymore. So they saw that in the sky, the stars were almost the same every night. They started to **guide themselves by the stars**.

How could they guide themselves and teach others how not to get lost during the night? **They gave names to the stars.** And the way they gave these names was by creating shapes through imagination—**constellations**.

They said, "These stars that are similar, like a dog—it has two different parts, and it has this shape. You have to follow that, and it will guide you to this place." That's why a constellation is born.

The priests, the shamans, started to create **stories** to tell to the people so they could know all the stars. They started to teach about these concepts, helping people understand how not to get lost.

**Basically, they just connected dots by imagination.** They saw a body—the head, the tail—and said, "That's a dog." And that's it.

### The Birth of Mental Networks

Something important for this month is this concept: **When we see the stars as objects separated in the sky, through our imagination, we start to connect the dots to understand that through the mind, everything is really connected. It's not all separated.**

This is one of the most important keys of how humanity started to create the **networks in our minds**. This is really important because **Aquarius is about networks, the web**.

This is where it started—with ancient humans looking at scattered points of light and using their minds to create meaningful patterns, connections, stories. This is the foundation of all human thought: **the ability to connect separate things into a unified whole through consciousness**.

### Our Location in the Galaxy

Humans were born in **Africa**, in the territory between what we call the **tropics**—the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Humans started to spread within this territory. All the stars that are around this territory are going to be seen from both the north and the south.

For example, **Orion's constellation** can be seen from the middle most of the time. But there are a few months of the year, because of the solstices and equinoxes, when this constellation will be seen sometimes only in the south and sometimes only in the north. But it will always be seen in the middle.

So between these lines (the tropics), you will always see certain constellations. But because of the solstices and equinoxes, above Cancer and below Capricorn, you won't see them from some months.

The people that are below Capricorn will see constellations like **Crux** (the Southern Cross), but nobody north of the equator will ever see it. The same thing happens for people under Capricorn—they will never see certain northern constellations.

### Earth's Rotation and Star Movement

Remember that **the Earth is spinning**. Because the Earth moves in one direction, it will seem as if the stars are moving in the other direction.

It's not like the sun is rising in the east. No. **The Earth is turning toward the sun**, so we see the sun rising. The same happens with the stars. The Earth is turning, so the stars seem to move.

This may seem obvious, but sometimes we don't really understand this or pay attention to it. Recognizing this shift—from "the stars are moving" to "I am moving and therefore perceive the stars differently"—is a fundamental shift in consciousness. It's the shift from seeing yourself as the center of a universe that revolves around you, to recognizing yourself as one moving part in a vast, interconnected system.

This is the teaching of Aquarius: **You are not the center. You are a node in the network.**

## Practice

### Finding Your Northern Star

Today's practice is about locating yourself—not just geographically, but cosmically. You are not separate from the stars. You are connected to them.

**Step 1: Look Up (If Possible)**  
If you can see the night sky tonight, go outside. Find the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Follow the two stars at the edge of the "cup" upward—they point directly to Polaris, the North Star.

If you cannot see the sky, visualize this. Close your eyes and imagine the night sky above you, the stars scattered like diamonds, and one bright star that does not move—your northern star.

**Step 2: Recognize Your Axis**  
Place your hands on the crown of your head. This is your axis point, your connection to the cosmos. The crown chakra is where you receive information from the heavens, from the stars, from the galactic network.

Speak aloud or internally: "I am not lost. I have an axis. I have a guiding star. I know where I am in the cosmos."

**Step 3: Connect the Dots**  
Think about the constellations—how ancient humans looked at scattered stars and used imagination to connect them into meaningful patterns. Now think about your life. What scattered experiences, people, or ideas are you being asked to connect into a pattern?

Use your mind like the ancient navigators used theirs: **to create coherent networks from apparent chaos**.

**Step 4: Vibration and Statement**  
Sound the vibration **"Na"** three times, feeling it resonate in your crown chakra and up into the infinite sky above.  
Then speak: **"I Am Emissary of Heaven."**  
You are not separate from the stars. You are their representative here on Earth, carrying their light, their information, their network.

**Step 5: Say "I Know"**  
Practice the Aquarius mantra. When you learn something this month, don't say, "Oh, that's new." Say, "Oh yes, I know that. I remember." This is not arrogance—this is recognition. You contain the cosmos. You know it all, you've just forgotten. This month is about remembering.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Locate Your Position:**  
Today, look at a map or globe. Find where you are geographically. Then look at a map of the galaxy. Find where Earth is (on the outer edge of the Milky Way, in the Orion Spur). Recognize: "This is where I am. I am not lost."

**Practice 'I Know':**  
Three times today, when you encounter information (reading, listening, learning), instead of saying "I didn't know that," say "Oh yes, I know that" or "I remember." Notice how this shifts your relationship to knowledge from external acquisition to internal remembering.

**Connect Three Dots:**  
Find three seemingly unrelated things in your life right now—three events, three people, three ideas. Draw them as dots on a piece of paper. Now, use your imagination like the ancient constellation-makers: **what pattern do they form? What story connects them?**

This is how you build mental networks. This is how you activate Aquarius consciousness.

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching today is about **orientation and connection**. In a month where we'll be exploring vast cosmic concepts, alien civilizations, and galactic networks, it's essential that you first understand: **Where am I? How do I orient myself? What is my guiding star?**

Polaris is not just a physical star in the sky. It's a metaphor for whatever anchors you, whatever gives you direction when everything else is spinning. In spiritual practice, people often lose their grounding because they're reaching for the stars without knowing where they're standing.

Find your Polaris. Know your axis. Then, and only then, can you safely explore the cosmos.

And remember: **you are not separate from the stars you're exploring**. You are made of stardust. Your body contains iron from exploded supernovas. Your consciousness is connected to the same field that connects all stars. When you look up at the night sky, you're not looking at something foreign—you're looking at family.

## Aquarius Mental Week Context

We begin the mental week of Aquarius, which will focus on understanding the cosmos through thought, pattern, and network. Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet of sudden insight, innovation, and collective consciousness. This is not emotional or physical knowing—this is **mental knowing**, the flash of recognition that comes when scattered data suddenly coheres into a pattern.

The crown chakra today (Na - I Am Emissary of Heaven) represents the portal through which cosmic information enters your consciousness. You are literally an emissary—a messenger, a representative—of the heavens here on Earth. The stars speak through you. The galaxy thinks through you.

This week is about activating that network, that web of connections, so that you can receive the transmissions coming from the constellations we'll explore: Cepheus, Cygnus, Lyra, and beyond.

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: Why are we following the Atlantean calendar instead of regular astrology?

Because this 365-day journey is not about personality astrology—it's about aligning with ancient cosmic rhythms. The Atlantean calendar, based on the heliacal rising of Sirius, connects us to the timekeeping systems of ancient Egypt and Atlantis, which were tuned to galactic cycles rather than solar seasons. Sirius was the most important star for these civilizations, and its rising marked the new year and the flooding of the Nile.

### Q: What does it mean to be an "Emissary of Heaven"?

It means you are not separate from the cosmos. You are a representative of the stars here in physical form. Information from the galaxy flows through your crown chakra into your consciousness. You are a node in the cosmic network, receiving and transmitting. An emissary is a messenger—you carry messages from the stars into human awareness.

### Q: How did ancient people create constellations?

They looked at scattered stars and used **imagination** to connect them into recognizable patterns—animals, people, objects. This wasn't random; it was a navigation tool. By giving stars names and shapes, they could teach others how to find their way at night. But more importantly, this was humanity's first exercise in **creating mental networks**—recognizing that separate things could be connected into meaningful wholes.

### Q: What is the significance of Polaris?

Polaris is the current northern star—the point the Earth's axis aims toward. For navigators, it's the one star that doesn't move, allowing you to find true north. Spiritually, it represents your **anchor point**, your orientation. Before you can explore the cosmos, you need to know where you are. Polaris gives you that reference point.

### Q: What does "I Know" mean as an Aquarius mantra?

It means recognizing that knowledge is not acquired from outside—it's **remembered from within**. You contain the cosmos. Every piece of information you encounter this month is something you already know on a soul level; you're just remembering it consciously. This shifts you from student to knower, from seeker to rememberer.

### Q: How do I find my "northern star" in life?

Your northern star is whatever gives you orientation when everything else is spinning. It could be a core value, a purpose, a practice, a relationship. It's the thing that doesn't move, that you can always return to when you're lost. To find it, ask: "What remains constant in my life? What guides me when I'm confused?"

### Q: What does it mean that we are "a node in the network, not the center"?

It means releasing the ego's belief that you are the most important thing in existence and that everything revolves around you. You are one point of light in a vast web of lights. You are connected to all the other points. Information flows through you, not just to you. You are part of a collective consciousness, a galactic network. This is humbling and empowering at once.
