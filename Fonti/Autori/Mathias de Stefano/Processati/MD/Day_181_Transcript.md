# Day 181 - Consciousness Work

## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening and welcome to the month of Aquarium.

So just to remind you and to explain for those who join us today or in this day , that we are starting Aquarium today , not because the astrology , because we are not following the astrology neither the ideal or the tropical astrology right now. We are following the Atlantic months and the Atlantic months are counted as 30 days from the moment in which the star of serious rise up in the horizon. That was always for 2020 , 2020.

So that 's why our 360 days of this year will be until July 29th , okay? But that 's why we are here beginning Aquarium today , even if it astrological , it has started a few days ago.

So along this entire month that we begin today of Aquarium , we will be connecting with the stars , with the constellations , with the skies.

So we are going to connect with the vision of the future , but from the point of view of the aliens.

So we will connect with that information throughout this month , I guess.

So the topic for today which is Paris is , it 's trying to remind us that we have to find our northern star to find the axis to be able to understand where we are , okay , in this sky.

So if we are going to the stars in this month , we have to understand where are we in those stars and how are the others connecting to us in those stars?

So along this whole month , we will be connecting with this stars and how they see us and how we connect with this stars throughout the galaxy. But in order to understand that today we have to picture where we are in this connection within the galaxy.

So first of all , I 'm sorry that I posted in the blog really late today and it 's so much to much information. But today I moved again , I had to arrange everything again here and because I came back home as you see in Gia.

So it took a long time until I could see it and right to connect again with the place and it was so much information that I needed to that I needed to take my time.

So first of all , to thank , we have , so we have a new music. I do n't know if you have heard it yet. It 's a beautiful music and I have to thank Juli del Canal , Mariano , and Gia Capiluti for the music that they are doing and the really good song vibration that they did for this month. And I hope it will take us very deep into the skies.

So from where we begin , I have my black , my board.

So again , we start. It 's better that I have the board because I really needed.

## Q&A

So I will ask you to pay a lot of attention because it 's a lot of data I guess to understand today.

So we can locate ourselves in the galaxy. There are many , many things that we do n't know about our location of the galaxy. And I guess it 's really important to locate ourselves and to understand the relationship we have with the other stars.

So the concept of the attribute of the I am in our periods is I know.

So during this whole month we will work with the I know because Aquarium is the one that says I know everything. I know this already. I already knew that I know how this works. Aquarium is the one that will remind us that we have the knowledge of the whole cosmos inside of us , the stars within.

So everything that we will see , we will have to understand that , oh , I know that. Oh , yes , I knew that. Yes , I know that.

So let 's go to that.

So let 's go from where we begin , for the small or big. And where can I begin because it 's the whole galaxy.

Okay , I can you see it? How do you can see it?

So just remember that the reason why we have here the north and here the south is because of the iron. Yes , the iron in the quarter of the planet that points all of it to the positive energy.

Okay , to the like a magnet.

So it goes to the north.

So that 's why we have the north. Hmm. Here goes all the energy and then creates that magnetic field.

So this constellation here is called Usa Minor. That means the tiny bear. We have the Usa Minor , the bigger bear. But this is this are the names that European people put because they had bears in the territory.

In Africa and Middle East , this constellation was called the dog.

So this was the tail of the dog.

So that 's how this dog was known at first the tail of the dog.

So let 's go first to why a bear or why a dog.

So first of all , before we go to this , let 's go to understand why a constellation has the shape of a bear or the shape of a dog. There is some why this happened. We have to go to Capricorn again and remember that in the ancient times the people used to walk around the planet looking for food.

So when they started to walk around the guidance cells by the hills , the mountains , the rivers , the shores , the trees to look for food. But there was a moment when they started to migrate really far that they could n't guide themselves by the geography.

So they saw that in the sky the stars were almost the same every night.

So they started to guide themselves by the stars.

So how could they guide themselves and teach others how to not to get lost during the night , during the time?

So what they had to do was to give names to those stars. And the way they gave these names is by creating these shapes by imagination that we call today the constellations.

So they said , these that stars that are similar like a dog , like it has two different parts and two like has the shape.

So you have to follow that and it will guide you to la la , tell it please. That 's why a constellation is born.

So then the priest , the shaman , they start to create stories to tell to the people.

So they could know all the stars. They start to teach about these concepts.

So they start to help the people to understand how to not get lost.

So basically they just connected dots by imagination. And that 's what they created like a body to part , the head and the tail and they said , that 's a dog. And that 's it.

So something important for this model is that this concept , when we see the stars as object separated in the sky , through our imagination , we start to connect the dots to understand that through the mind , everything is really connected. It 's not all separated.

So that 's one of the most important keys of how the humanity started to create the networks in our minds.

So it 's really important because a query is about that. It 's about networks , the web.

So here comes a way in which this started.

So remember that humans are born here in Africa , in the territory here , which is in between the territories that we call the tropics.

So the humans start to spread imaging the topic of cancer and capricorn. In between the territory , the tropics. All the stars that are around the territory are going to be seen from the north and from the south.

Okay? We see them from both places.

So for example , Orion 's constellation , you can see it from the middle , most of the time , but there are a few months of the year because of the sources and the epinoxies when they move around that this constellation will be seen sometimes only in the south and sometimes only in the north , but always will be seen in the middle.

So in between these lines , you will always see this constellation , but because of sources and epinoxies , above cancer and below capricorn , you wo n't see it from some months.

So the people that is below capricorn here will be constellations like crux , but nobody our oath will see it ever. The same thing happened for the people under the capricorn. They would never see SA meager.

Remember that the earth is spinning in this sense. Because the earth moves in this sense and this direction , it will seem as if the stars are moving in this other direction. I was just saying sorry that I am trying to explain this , which seems so silly , but sometimes we do n't really understand this or we do n't pay attention to that.

So it 's not like the sun is rising in the east. It 's the earth moving towards the east that makes the sky seem to move in this direction.

So remember that this spinning here is really big , but when we go to the north , the spinning is so fast and so tiny that it seems like the stars in the north move lower , slower than this one 's than with faster.

So it 's like this one 's are moving constantly very like they take a long path and you see them moving hour by hour , but when you are in the north , you see this one 's almost not moving.

So we say this is like a fixed star. But really all the stars are fixed , all the stars are there , but we are moving around.

So fast here that it seems like if it is moving faster.

So it 's just an illusion , a perception that this one 's here move faster and this one are not moving.

So basically nothing is really fixed in the universe. Everything is moving constantly , but the things are so far away that you can not perceive how they move.

So that 's why the perception of the movement is only from our movement in earth. In this territory here is where the people start to move around the planet.

So they start to expand through different regions of these of the tropical region of the planet.

So in this territory the stars are moving so fast that that they 're moving so fast from the from our point of view that is difficult to follow a path because the stars are moving constantly.

So the only way you can you can just see always the same direction is by the stars that are not moving basically.

So that is why the people the explorers , the the the the the immigration 's the sailors they were looking into the north and star.

So they do n't get lost.

So let 's use another color. For another thing.

So remember now that the sun as we spoke in Sagittarius , the sun is pulling the earth by gravity is so heavy that it 's pulling the earth.

So that changed the the north the the axis. Yeah and it makes the earth moving in circles in the opposite direction. And this turn is 26,000 years.

Remember this turn here takes 24 hours this turn here turns 26,000 years.

So remember that this spinning like this takes 20,000 , 26,000 years. We can divide it in 12 different regions and each one of them will be called an era. That 's what we call the pieces era , a queries era , Capricorn era , Leo and so on which take approximately 24,000 years each.

So in this turn in this spinning in each era era , the axis of the planet will be pointing to a different northern star.

So during this 2000 years starting a thousand years in the past in the middle ages till the year 3000 in the future , Paris will be our northern star. For example , 12,000 years ago in the end of the of the Atlanta era , Atlanta civilization the northern star was bigger and during the Egyptian period , the northern star was Alfa Zracones.

So it is changing. It 's because of this that when the earth starts to spin , because of the gravity of the sun , the physical axis of the planet is moving around in this period of time.

So because of this movement , whenever the earth is spinning , these stars are the ones that will seem like quiet and still.

So around 26,000 years ago , Paris was our northern star. And that moment was really important for humanity because 26,000 years ago , was the time when Paris , when humanity recognized the strength of , oh , that 's what we can do. It became intelligent beings , able to create cultures in that period.

So that 's why this people started to create like a leap of evolution after thousands and millions of years of human history in that period of time , 26,000 years ago , they jumped into what we are today.

So now we are again in the axis of this star.

So that 's why it means that in this period of time we have the opportunity to create a great leap into a new evolution for the next 26,000 years. And that 's why Paris is so important for us as the guide star because it means the opportunity to make a great leap , a great jump into an able level of consciousness.

So I am erasing everything. Just you may be seeing me very , very like , who , yes , this is a time , but of course I 'm speaking about universal time.

So we are not going to do this leap in just next year. This will take another thousand years. But well , anyway , it 's just the emotion of knowing that we are in the middle.

Now we are going to have another thing.

Sorry , sorry , but I am going to speak a lot today.

So now we go to another thing.

Now let 's go a little bit more towards the bigger thing. Can you see it? I imagine that you know what is this? Moon , Earth and Sun.

Just a psychological information. I used to put the sun hidden like this because I met my dad when I was 27.

So I never had my dad with me.

So my mom is in the middle because she was always there and my grandmother.

So that 's why I did n't put the sun in the middle.

So just as a detail.

So we are in this place that we call the solar system.

So we have Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Neptune , Trans and there , Pluto.

So this is the solar system and the limits of the solar system is called the cloud of port. And here in the middle we have the Astros Belt.

So what I want to show here is the distances of things.

So we can not understand it.

So let 's use round numbers , not detail numbers.

So the light moves at 300,000 kilometers per second.

So the speed of light is this number. The amount of kilometers that you have to do to go all around the planet through the equator is 40,000 kilometers. This means that approximately 4,000 kilometers. This means that in one second , one , the light can turn , can make eight turns around the planet.

Eight. If this spinning here takes eight turns in one second , eight turns around the planet.

So from the sun to the Earth , the light takes eight minutes. And that is 150 million kilometers. There 's a lot. Very far away.

Now let 's picture this. This is the solar system and this here is the cloud of Earth or the cloud. Think about this. From the sun to the Earth , the light takes eight minutes.

From the Earth to the limits of the Earth cloud to light years. Two years.

So this limit , the cloud of Earth , are all the different tiny different pieces like asteroids and and comets and and stuff that are floating around. And they come back pushed by the gravity of the sun and sometimes they collapse and and and creates a disaster in the in planets.

So all of them are here. But once you , some of these tiny little pieces go out of the limits of the Earth cloud , they are not pulled anymore by the variety of the sun. They go the way.

So imagine that for a human to get here , we 'll need approximately 100,000 years.

Sorry. 50,000.

So 50,000 years to get to the limit. Just think about this. This is the cloud of Earth. This is a solar system and the closest star that we have is Alpha Century and Alpha Century is the closest one and it 's four light years.

Four light years. Too much. And now we go to the big thing. Let 's go to the galaxy.

So this would be our galaxy. Hmm.

So the galaxy from one side to the other needs 100,000 light years. Very big.

So this is the center of the galaxy and this dot here is our sun.

So our sun is inside a tiny arm of the galaxy called Orion 's arm. This arm here , the bigger one is called Perseus arm. This one here is Sagittarius arm. This is the arm of the Centaurus.

And this one here is called the arm of Normal. This arm of the galaxy.

Okay. From the Sun to the center of the galaxy , we have 24,000 light years. This territory here is really heavy. It 's impossible to live , to exist because the gravity is so much and it 's all pushed to a black hole.

In this territory around , we have 5,000 light years of weight of weight. Hmm.

Now I invite you to do this. If you have an open sky , no clouds. I invite you to go out tonight , see the sky and try to see as many stars as you can in the sky. All the ones you can.

And all of them that you can count and see are just inside this circle. Just that. If you are able to go to a very clean place , like the other common desert , the well any desert without light , without much contamination of light , you will be able of sea , of watch this territory of the galaxy. And with a really big telescope , like the NASA or any telescope that is in the sky , you can find in this planet , you will be able to see even other galaxies.

But you will never be able to see what is in this territory of the galaxy. Behind these cares of the center. Hmm.

So all the stars that we usually see like Orion , Series , Play it is , ArttuRus , and all the stars that we usually speak about. All of them are inside this circle.

So one important thing is not the same speaking about stars , then speaking about constellations. Let 's see why. Imagine that usually when we speak about constellations , they used to say they used to name the stars like Alpha , Drama , Began , Drama , Gamandramida , like the Greek letters.

So you have all the names of the stars that are part of the constellation , named like this Alpha Beta-Gama , so on.

So some of these stars , some of them are here close to our solar system. Other ones here , other ones outside , in the center of us , other one is really far away in Perseus , and other one that seems like a star is actually a galaxy called Androndramida , which is very far away. Very far away.

So to understand this , when we say about the beings that lives in the constellations , it 's not that the constellation has all these stars together like a group of stars , and that 's the constellation. A constellation is a perception from our point of view from Earth that connect the dots on the stars that we see there. But actually , there are in different distances and different things that are not part of a tiny thing of a group of stars.

So I hope you can understand this now that when we say for example , then Drommidem people , we are not speaking about the people from the galaxy of Androndramida , we are maybe speaking about one of the stars on the constellation of Androndramida.

So that 's our point of view. It 's not that they all are together , but is our perception. I 'm sorry , but I know it 's too much , but it 's important for everything that we are going to speak in the other moments.

So this is how we should see it.

So maybe this star is at four years. This is 250,000 years. This is 300 years. This is 60 years , but all of them from our point of view will shape a constellation.

So all this is basically connected anyway with the thought , the network of thinking of the universe , of the mind of the universe. It 's all connected.

So it does n't matter what distances this is , it will be anyway connected to the mind. To understand this also , we might say that that because these stars are really far , they can not affect us because the gravity is really far away.

So it 's impossible to affect us. But actually , they were they appear billions of years before.

So they are not , they are affecting us through from the very beginning because everything is really connected.

So because everything is really connected , we have to understand that today the science may be say that there is a void in between the planets and the stars. And we can not understand really. But today speaking about the space is like when before , people thought that there was no air that there was a void in between the things that nothing was connected. And now we know that everything 's all filled with things , with the air , with the atoms , and so on.

So eventually we will know that of this connection and how this gravity affect us anyway.

So that 's how the astrology can affect us because of these poses of gravity that as farther they are , the lower they affect.

So sometimes we say this constellation is affecting us. But it 's not the constellation , it 's some stars of that constellation that affect us.

Sorry that I am speaking too much about the information is here , so I am trying to say it anyway.

So the thing is that most of the times it 's not the pressure of the gravity of the stars that affect us astrological , but it is our mind receiving how the place and the moment we are living in this planet when the constellation is there is effectiveness.

So this is much more psychological aspect of astrology that is more related to what is happening on earth , when or while the star is there than the star itself affecting us. Just to get the point to understand how maybe this works. Let 's explain it with the moon. The moon has a gravitational weight , it 's a matter , so it has a weight and a gravity.

But the gravity of the earth is bigger , so it 's pulling the moon around. But the movement of this gravity of the moon is pushing the water of the planet.

So that 's why the tides in the oceans are related to the moon because the energy in the weight of the moon is moving the waters.

So also the water , it 's moved within ourselves. We are water.

So that 's why when the full moon appears , which is when the bright of the sun reflects in the moon and comes to us , the energy of the moon is bigger on us because the light is coming to us in one second.

So that 's why the water in our bodies is affected by the full moon. That 's why the cycle of the menstruation in women are related to the full moon , to the cycles of the moon , the mood of the people is also related to the moon and so on.

So everyone gets crazy when there is full moon and that 's it.

So the thing is that the first times that the pressure , the gravity of the moon , affect us all the time , usually affect us constantly.

So because of this movement , we have been thousands of years prepared to see how the cycles are.

So our bodies get , our bodies got used to , our bodies got used to this reception of information from the moon.

So , psychologically , we got ready. We would prepare for what is coming every moon.

So sometimes it 's not the moon or the sun or whatever star affecting us but is our own psychological preconception of what can come with its presence that we activate.

So it 's like when someone throws to you something and the first time will heat you but next time you will do a reflection , you will have a reflection of how to oops no more light. How sorry , okay no light.

So what I was saying is that that that way was saying is that when someone throws to you something you will have the reflection. This means that your mind got used to the reaction of what is going to happen in that situation.

So astrological also happened that it 's like you are pretty pretty supposed to what is going to happen because you naturalized the cycles , okay. Then we are going to go into that much more.

So do n't worry. You okay see.

So I guess that one more thing.

So something that we have to understand about the skies is related to what I spoke about the distances of the light. Eight minutes takes the light to come from the sun to us. Four years takes the light from Alpha Century to us. Three hundred years takes the light from Orion to us.

So that means that whenever you look into the skies whenever you look into the skies you are always seen the past. You see always the past never the present. You 're seeing what happened in the stars 300 years ago , for years ago and the sun itself eight minutes ago all the time. The only thing you see in just one second is the moon.

So now when we think about aliens and people that are in the stars they usually see us in the same way. I mean if we look into the stars and we see the past when they look into our star they see the past. Hmm.

So we both are looking into our past but when someone in another planet got into the idea of I can communicate through light by my consciousness which is in everywhere in the universe and I can connect to everything in the universe through consciousness I will use the light to communicate with others.

So because they can see our past they will communicate with us through the past. That 's the way in which they can communicate with us in the present by communicating everything in the past. You get it? They are the future.

They are leaving a future but when they communicate with us they are information arrived to the past.

So I know this is a little bit chaotic but let 's try to explain it easier. But the idea is that the light is a way it 's a path of consciousness.

So we used light to go into consciousness.

So if light takes years to get to another planet that means that the way in which the consciousness moved through the universe it will take years to arrive to the other place.

So from there from their point of view in the future they will receive the light of our past.

So when they communicate with the consciousness they send the information to our past , not to our present. It 's a paradox of the universe. Let 's put an example. Let 's put this example.

So now think like we have an alien that is an alien of light in the sun and a human on earth eight minutes different.

Okay.

So the sun will emit this light that arrives to the planet in eight minutes. Here is night and here is day.

So the reflection of the light will come back to the sun and it will take eight minutes to arrive back.

So this being sent a message to this being from here. Just as an example imagine that this being of light is an artintinein which is very weird but which is very weird but this is an an a light of being that is an artintinein why it are tintinein because we used to say we used to affirm the sentences by saying no before like no no like but this no means yes it 's kind of our sung.

So imagine that this guy is an artintinein that says that the answer is yes that wants to send an answer to this one on the earth and says the answer was yes but first thing he says is no.

So this person here will take eight minutes to receive the message of no and that person will believe that the message was no and it will take eight minutes more until the answer yes will arrive.

So that 's the that the distance okay so this person will receive the information eight minutes later and if this one answer back this person will receive the message eight minutes later.

So the concept of this is that these people got to find a tool they found a tool a solution for this conflict.

So the way they found the solution of this is that they found the mind and they said oh the tool that we have to communicate with everything is the mind because everything is connected.

So they said okay I have to communicate with the mind but the mind is vibration so everything is connected by vibration so but in order to connect with the vibration I have to use the photons which is the light.

So when they found the mind when they receive the message eight minutes later instead of sending an answer back that will take eight minutes they just become the mind so become the everything and they just answer themselves they just answer themselves not using the vibration not using sending information through the light they become the answer through the mind the concept is that instead of answering back through the vibration that will take eight minutes more to get here they just become the mind and when they receive the light they used the light to know that there is someone and they become themselves the mind of the whole thing and answer by becoming the answer.

So they do n't send they do n't use the streaming to the earth back they just speak to that person eight minutes ago.

So the best way to understand this is telepathy but the thing is that through telepathy I am just answering the question inside I 'm not sending that back so it will not go straight to the person it will just be answered to the person eight minutes ago.

So I will be always speaking with the past. What they are what usually the aliens are connecting with us in the past because they are receiving the light of our planet in the past so they live in the future but when they receive the information and answer the information they can only communicate with us in the past. Basically , I explained this because when we say why the ancient people has so many technology and we do n't have that connection with the aliens basically is because we are asking those questions now and the answers of how to do it with the aliens arrived to our past.

So it 's this part of those of the universe that the people in the past are having the answers of our questions today. I do n't know if you get it but I do n't know how to explain in here.

So maybe tomorrow I will be able to explain better. Even if it 's complicated I wanted to live all this explanation now the first day because in the next days maybe we 'll be connected with other beings in other dimensions or other I do n't know so just in case I wanted to explain all this before. And even more we have mercury retrograding so do n't expect much.

## Daily Practice Elements

So I will shut up. The vibration for today is La. The statement for today is I am the divine word. The code for today is water in the shape of vapor.

From the basis elements of creation the elemental trinities are founded. In the water trinity vapor represents the spiritual plane of information where the subconscious that surrounds everything radiated , it 's the subtle aspect of the cosmic memory carrying the data of the universe of the universal mind to every space of the world in the form of humidity. We are all connected by the unique spirit of water. When we finish with this just try not to think about everything there was folk now just do something silly and relax the mind.

So just a summary if you got lost in the explanation remember that we started to explain polarity to understand how we perceive this so we could understand where we are located how we see this kind how are all those constellations how the light travels through the space so we could understand how the other beings in other planets communicate with us so we can kind of understand in which times and how we communicate each other. As deeper we go into a square it will get much mysterious and deeper into the other realities and so on so maybe it would be complicated.

So it 's comfortable close your eyes. And I focus in my breathing. I pay attention to the environment that I am in and I use my imagination to picture this space. This place is a dark night and deep space around.

If I feel so I can position my body in a shape and a comfortable position that reminds me of earth and I use my imagination to feel that I am earth. Take any breath. Take any breath. And imagine picture a big star in front of you is the sun and around me the moon and in between I perceive the planets.

Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Trans , Neptune , planets , Saturn , Mere definitive and Pluto. I am the solar system. Way beyond. Behind the sun and the planets.

I can see the stars , the constellations. All through the river of dust. In the arm of Orion. Inside the great galaxy of the Milky Way.

The beautiful midway was located. In the modernised dark , the far backer came to rule me Shining bright , Algiris Reminded me That this is my north , my axis That I am here and now This is my place in between all this existence around me A map of And this is the moment we are realized that the earth is not below me. And this sky is not above. It 's the moment I realize that the earth is a speak.

Emitting thousands of stars in this sky. I become aware that the earth is not below that the earth has been always part of the heaven. And it 's light shines like a star. And I realize that this light that shines from it is the word of the divinity , speaking through the light , through the consciousness , to this great network of conscious planets and stars.

The earth speaks through the light to the other worlds. Holding the axis in Pirates. I open myself singing through the light of my consciousness to call and to receive the messages and the words of the other conscious worlds surrounding. Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh.

I am the divine word. I am the divine word. I am the divine word. And my word is being heard.

My all those who leave in the different plants of this great galactic configuration. I know , I know , I know. This is the word that I must use to let no , to the great galactic configuration that I am ready to speak with them. I know.

Take a deep breath and slowly and softly. I carry this my body. Come back , come in back here and now. Here.

Thank you everybody for being there and the soul is here tomorrow at the same time.
