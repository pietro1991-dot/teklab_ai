## Overview

We have journeyed through the first four dimensions: polarity (1st), imagination (2nd), matter (3rd), and time (4th). Today we arrive at the **fifth dimension**—the unity of time and space, the dimension of consciousness itself.

Many spiritual seekers long for the fifth dimension, believing it to be a paradise, a utopia where everything is perfect. But the fifth dimension is not a place you escape to. It is the **reflection of the third and fourth dimensions**—the mirror that shows you your whole existence from beginning to end.

This teaching addresses a profound confusion: the idea that higher beings from other dimensions are controlling us, that we are puppets with a master pulling strings. But there is no one "out there" controlling us. The higher self is not separate from us. **We are one being experiencing itself from different angles.**

Matias shares his own struggle: believing Gan, his higher self, was controlling his life from outside. When he tried to disconnect from Gan, his life became a disaster. Finally, he understood: **Gan is not someone else. Gan is a part of him in another dimension, and he is a part of Gan in another dimension.** They are one.

In the same way, you—this body—are the higher self of your liver. How many times did you ask your liver what it wanted to eat before you ate pizza or drank soda?

This is the relationship. The fifth dimension is not someone outside controlling you. It is **you in full awareness**, seeing all your timelines, all your possibilities, all your past and future as one.

## Clarifying the Higher Self

### There is No "Higher" or "Lower"

In the universe, there is no true concept of "higher self" and "lower self." These are **human perspectives** based on how we structure reality.

Matias calls the higher self **"I Am"** and the lower self **"I"**. But **I Am** is the whole thing. One cannot work without the other.

These conceptions come from Earth, from our human point of view. When we describe dimensions, we are not describing them from the point of view of humanity—we are describing them from the point of view of **geometry**, which does not have the morals we have.

There is **no one outside controlling us**. It is **us in different levels**.

### Matias and Gan: The Struggle for Freedom

Matias shares his own experience:

During his life, he had this conflict, believing that Gan (his higher self) was someone from outside, controlling his life. He felt like a puppet, with Gan as the master of the puppet.

He wanted to be free, so he said: "I don't want that being telling me what to do and controlling my whole life. I want to be free, to be my own."

So he decided to **disconnect from Gan** many times in his life.

When he did that, his life was **terrible, horrible**. Everything was a complete mess, a disaster.

At the time, he thought this was because of Gan—that his higher self was trying to control him and was doing everything wrong in order to force him to not have a proper life being free. He blamed Gan for this.

Until, with the years, he suddenly recognized: **"Oh no. Gan is not someone else controlling my life. Gan is a part of me in another dimension, and I am a part of him in another dimension. We are one. We are together."**

That is why when he wanted to separate himself from Gan, everything went wrong—because **he was disconnecting from himself**.

### The Liver Metaphor

Now let's go the opposite way.

Matias, this body, is the **higher self of his liver**.

The liver is an organ inside him, a tiny part in another dimension of himself. This being here, the entire body, is the higher self of the liver.

Now ask yourself: **How many times did you ask your liver what it wanted to eat?**

How many times did you ask your liver if it wanted sugar, or Coke, or pizza? Isn't it true that sometimes you just eat sugar or Coke or pizza, and that's it? You just eat it, **not asking your liver**.

**That is how you have to see it in the big picture.**

The reason we think or believe that someone outside is controlling our lives is because **we are not aware yet of how to handle our own reality**. Because we don't know how to handle it, we relate our power to someone bigger that has much more awareness about ourselves.

Until we become aware of ourselves.

## What is the Fifth Dimension?

### The Mirror of Time and Space

Remember:
- Third dimension = **space**
- Fourth dimension = **time**

Together, we have space and time.

The **fifth dimension** is the **reflection** of time and space. It is the **mirror** of the third and fourth dimensions.

### The Simple Example: The Mirror

The simplest example is this: go and watch yourself in a mirror. Stand in front of a mirror.

Your body is the third dimension. The fourth dimension is the **process**, the time that passes while you are watching yourself in the mirror. Time is passing by. An inner process is happening through the vision.

And you see your reflection in the mirror. **That reflection is the fifth dimension.**

As you look into the mirror, **your reflection is looking back at you**. You are watching yourself in the mirror. Your reflection is watching you.

### Not a Straight Line

It is important to understand that this is not like a straight line—where I am here in the third dimension, so my reflection in the parallel dimension is also in the third dimension, and this one is in the fourth dimension.

This is a **summary of concepts**. All of this is not happening as a reflection of the third, reflection of the fourth. It is happening **everything in the fifth dimension**.

The fifth dimension is the **connection and the logic of these two together**.

---

## The Fifth Dimension as Consciousness

### Answering "Why" and "What For"

The third dimension asks: **"Why?"**

The fourth dimension asks: **"What for?"**

The fifth dimension, through this reflection, is the one able to **answer both questions**: Why? And what for?

The reason the fifth dimension can answer these questions is because **it is the summary of everything that happened in the matter and through time**.

In the fifth dimension, you have the **whole package of everything that happened** in the past, the present, and the future—the **fullness of your whole existence**.

The life you are living in the fifth dimension is the one that is **aware of all your existence from the beginning to the end**.

This is why the fifth dimension is the **dimension of consciousness**.

### Why is it Consciousness?

Because it can see everything from the unity—the **unity between time and space**.

This is why the beings that live in the fifth dimension are called **guides and masters**.

A **guide** is the one that tells you where you go. A **master** is the one that explains to you why you go.

### Speaking to Your Past Self

Have you ever heard this question: "If you were able to speak with the child you once were, what would you say to yourself?"

Have you done this in therapy or meditation?

This is a question **for the fourth dimension**. From you being an adult right now, you use the resources of the fourth dimension in order to **speak with yourself in the past**.

So what would you say?

Maybe, being an adult, you tell your child self: "Don't worry, everything is going to be okay. Don't be afraid. Whatever happens, you will be fine."

### Guides Are Future Versions of Ourselves

So why would it be different when we listen to the voices of a guide or a master in the fifth dimension, giving us advice on what to do, where to go?

**What if the voices we hear from the fifth dimension are just trying to help us—help themselves—in another dimension, by guiding themselves (us) to go properly through the third and the fourth dimension?**

Just as we use the fourth dimension to speak with our past in order to heal it, **beings in the fifth dimension speak to us (their past selves) to guide and help us**.

The beings in the fifth dimension—**they are beings that exist, that are real, that are there**. Masters with their names, with their stories, everything. But they are beings that accomplished, that managed to **transcend and unify space and time as one**.

That is why they can see everything.

We can talk to them. We can say whatever to them. And they will listen to us **because they are us**, seeing a different reality in a different dimension.

## We Are All One Experiencing Different Stages

### Changing Through Life

You are not the same when you were seven years old as when you are thirty years old, or sixty years old. It is not the same. **You change.** We all change. We are not the same person.

This is exactly as it happens with the fifth dimension.

When we transcend into another dimension, it is exactly the same as **we, with sixty years old, transcended the seven-year-old**.

This is why we can consider that they are **different beings with different names, with different lives**—and even though, **they are me**.

### Non-Linear Process

Be aware: we cannot understand this from a linear process. The line disappears here.

In the third dimension, with the fourth dimension, the timeline is completely different. In the fifth dimension, **completely different**. There is **no line**.

This is why it is difficult to understand.

---

## Why People Want to Live in the Fifth Dimension

### Unity of Time and Space

Why do so many people want to go to the fifth dimension?

Because the fifth dimension is the **unity between time and space**. The physics of space and the quantities of time become together as one.

That means **we can live our dreams**. We can **manifest our dreams**.

This is why we picture the fifth dimension as this beautiful, amazing place, a utopia where everything is perfect.

### Clarity and Consciousness

In difference from the fourth dimension, in the fifth dimension there is **clarity and consciousness**. This means that in the fifth dimension, **we do not have confusion**. We do not have doubt.

---

## The Quantum Leap

### What is a Quantum Leap?

Many people ask: what is a quantum leap? What is this quantum leap people talk about to go to the fifth dimension?

A leap, a jump, is a concept. But this little person does not have to jump. It has to **project itself**.

A **quantum leap** means that one being **projected itself into another dimension completely**.

### How We Make Quantum Leaps

We humans make this quantum leap **by dying** when we are unaware. We die and we go into another dimension.

But if we become **fully aware**, we can do this leap **physically**—which is like what aliens do. Going here, coming here.

Many aliens that live in three-dimensional worlds use the fourth dimension and even the fifth dimension in order to **move from one world to another**.

This means they are not using **space** to move through. They are using **time**.

### Bending Time and Space

When a being moves through space in the third dimension, they need to move through space—they need projection in order to go here, to go to a spot, to a place.

But a being that **moves through time** can make this jump instantly.

If one being is in the fifth dimension, what would they do?

A being from the fifth dimension **does not need to travel**, neither through time nor through space, because **it is always in the same spot**.

But we are here, **moving through time and space in the middle, in between**.

Because we are here in between time and space, we are **determined, attached to only one vision**—which is the vision of distance, the space. That is why we cannot see the whole options.

### Seeing from Different Dimensions

For example, as from the Earth, when we see a star, we see the light coming to us, and it will take a certain number of light-years of distance.

But from the fifth dimension, **this star is everywhere**.

As we are watching straight to one object, straight there, and we see one reality in the third dimension, we can measure the third dimension. Other beings from other realities can see a **totally different thing**.

That is why they can get through a mirror, or appear from nothing, something like that. This is why we can say a being appears in a place—why they appear and disappear so easily.

Because it is not that they are magical. They just **turn a corner of a dimension that we cannot perceive**.

## The Fifth Dimension Holds the Universe

### The Dark Matter

All the dark things in the universe that hold the stars, the sun, the planets, everything—**the dark side of the cosmos is held by the fifth dimension**.

### Gravity and the Net of Time and Space

We usually say that gravity is the concept where whatever object has much more weight attracts the ones that have lower weight. The moon, for example, is attracted to the Earth because the Earth is bigger.

But why do they levitate or float? Where are they exactly?

**Gravity** comes from Latin and means "quality of weight." If gravity is weight, this would say the moon is smaller, so it falls down. But why is the moon not falling down straight to the planet? Why is it going around?

What has been explained by theories is that this is much more related with the **networks of time and space**—like a net.

Imagine lines here are called **space**. Lines here are called **time**. This theory says everything in the universe is held by two **constants**. Constants mean **eternal**.

The constants are **time and space**.

### How Matter is Created

Imagine now that these planes start to **curve themselves**, contracting each other, creating **matter**.

The first particles are created by the **conjunction of time and space**, the constant of time and space.

As more particles of matter, more weight. As more weight of matter, the matter starts to **curve the lines of time and space**.

So the moon is not falling or floating around the Earth. It is **falling in a spiral way toward the Earth** (or going away, depending).

### Matter is Not Space

The object is the one that has weight—the matter. **Matter is not space.** Space is the place through which matter is moving. It is nothing. Matter is the **result of the combination of time and space**.

In the fifth dimension, there is **no up or down**. It is a whole, everything.

What from our point of view is a weight that goes down, from the fifth dimension it also goes **up and to one side, to another side, behind, and in front**.

From the fifth dimension, this object is **expanding and contracting toward every direction** as a constant reflection.

Basically, the fifth dimension is the one that is **allowing everything to exist in space**.

## Practice

### Reminder: Don't Worry

Before we start the alignment, Matias reminds us:

**It does not matter if you do not understand it now. Do not worry.**

Even Matias himself, the one explaining, took a lot of time to discover this. And he will continue to have a lot of time to rediscover new ways to understand the fifth dimension.

**We are all in process to understand it. So do not worry.**

It is not necessary to understand it now. Just take the information, and then you will know what to do, someday, somehow.

**Do not worry. Do not rush. Do not pressure yourself.**

Fool is the one who believes they know everything. We are all wandering, all trying to understand new things. So do not worry.

### Preparation

Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing.

Take a deep breath and become aware of your body and the place you find yourself in now.

### Expanding the Space

Take a deep breath, and with your imagination, expand the place, expand the room toward the infinite, expanding the roof, the floor, the walls in every direction, disappearing toward the infinite, still surrounded by the universal void.

### Recognizing All Dimensions

Recognize the **axis of your first dimension**, connecting upper and down through the spine and down up—your positive and negative.

Recognize the **shape, the human figure**, of your second dimension.

Take a deep breath and become aware of the **depth of your physical body** in the third dimension.

Take a deep breath and become aware of all the things you have been, you are, and you will be as this individual, as this being here and now, **through the time of the fourth dimension**.

### Seeing Your Guides and Masters

Take a deep breath and see—above, below, in front, behind, on both sides—**images of yourself with different faces, different colors**, coming toward you from all directions, watching you.

Recognize that **they are your guides and masters**.

See them as the **reflections of yourself in the fifth dimension**.

Recognize that **they are guiding you through life**.

### Interacting with Your Reflections

Recognize all these masters. Allow yourself to interact with them. Feel how they touch you. Feel how they share with you their visions of clarity and awareness.

See and feel all of them.

### Connecting Through the Heart

Go deep to your heart and start to **connect them all as one to you** through your vibration.

**I Am all of them. I Am the unity in this fifth dimension.**

### The Vibration Mï

Sound the vibration **Mï** from your solar plexus, your center of being.

**All the masters live in me.**

**I Am love unity. I Am love unity. I Am love unity.**

**I believe—all the masters live in me.**

**I Am love unity. I Am love unity. I Am love unity.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and expand the awareness of consciousness here and now, coming back slowly.

## Key Insights

- The fifth dimension is the **unity of time and space**, the reflection and mirror of the third and fourth dimensions.
- There is no true "higher self" and "lower self"—these are human concepts; in reality, **I Am** is the whole being.
- Your higher self is not someone outside controlling you; it is **you in another dimension**, and you are a part of it.
- Just as you are the higher self of your liver (and rarely ask it what it wants), your higher self relates to you the same way—until you become aware.
- Guides and masters in the fifth dimension are **future versions of ourselves** who have transcended and unified space and time.
- The fifth dimension can see your **whole existence from beginning to end**, which is why it can answer "why" and "what for."
- When we disconnect from our higher self, we disconnect from ourselves—which is why life becomes chaotic.
- A quantum leap is not a jump but a **projection** of being into another dimension; aliens use this to travel through time instead of space.
- The fifth dimension does not need to travel because it is **always in the same spot**, existing everywhere simultaneously.
- All the dark matter in the universe, holding stars and planets, is held by the **fifth dimension**.
- Matter is created by the **conjunction of time and space**, curving the fabric of reality.
- In the fifth dimension, there is **no up or down**, only expansion and contraction in all directions.
- Understanding the fifth dimension is not urgent—**we are all in process**; do not rush or pressure yourself.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, practice seeing your **guides and masters as reflections of yourself**.

When you receive intuitive guidance, recognize it is coming from **your own consciousness** in the fifth dimension—the part of you that can see your whole timeline and knows where you need to go.

When you speak to your inner child (your past self in the fourth dimension), notice that this is the **same relationship** your higher self has with you now. You are both the guide and the guided.

Practice asking yourself: "What would my future self, who has already lived through this, tell me right now?" Then listen. That voice is your fifth-dimensional consciousness.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel controlled by life, remember: **no one is controlling you from outside**. You are learning to handle your own reality. The higher self is not a puppeteer but a **fuller version of you** that sees more.

When you feel lost, remember: you have access to the fifth dimension through your **heart and solar plexus**. Connect to the unity of all your timelines. See yourself from beginning to end. Ask: "What is the pattern? What is the purpose?"

When you long to escape to the fifth dimension, remember: **you are already there**. The fifth dimension is not a place you go to. It is a state of consciousness you **awaken to** by integrating time and space within yourself.

Practice manifestation by **seeing all possibilities** (fifth dimension), choosing one timeline (fourth dimension), and bringing it into physical form (third dimension). This is the quantum leap.

## Week Context

We are in the **Mental Week of Pisces**, completing our understanding of dimensions through the mind. We learned that dimensions are measurements (Day 211), explored imagination and design (Day 212), discovered physical reality as fractalized illusion (Day 213), understood time as transformation (Day 214), and today we explored **consciousness as the unity of time and space** (Day 215).

Pisces is the sign of unity, of dissolving boundaries, of recognizing that all separation is illusion. The fifth dimension embodies this perfectly: **it is the dimension where all becomes one**, where time and space merge, where guides and seekers are revealed to be the same being, where consciousness sees itself whole.

This completes the Mental Week. We will continue exploring Pisces through the Emotional and Physical weeks, building on this foundation of dimensional understanding.

## Q&A

### Q: If my higher self can see my whole life, does that mean I have no free will?

Your higher self sees all **possibilities**, not just one predetermined path. Free will operates in the third and fourth dimensions, where you make choices moment by moment. The fifth dimension sees the **whole tree of possibilities**, but you are the one choosing which branch to walk. Your higher self is not forcing you; it is **you, aware of all paths**, gently guiding your current self toward the most aligned timeline.

### Q: How do I know if I'm hearing my higher self or just my own thoughts?

They are the same thing. Your higher self **is** your own thoughts, but from a fuller perspective. The difference is clarity: the higher self speaks with peace, certainty, and love. The egoic mind speaks with fear, doubt, and confusion. Practice discernment: does this guidance expand you or contract you? Does it bring clarity or confusion?

### Q: Why can't I just skip to the fifth dimension if it's so much better?

Because the fifth dimension is **the integration of the third and fourth**. You cannot skip steps. Trying to jump to the fifth without mastering the third and fourth is like trying to build the roof of a house without walls. You must **live fully in the third dimension** (coherence, presence, sensory experience) and **understand the fourth dimension** (transformation, process, time) before you can access the unity of the fifth.

### Q: What does it mean to manifest from the fifth dimension?

It means seeing all possible timelines, choosing one, and collapsing it into physical reality. In the fifth dimension, you see yourself healed, successful, joyful, free—all possibilities exist simultaneously. You **choose one** (fourth dimension) and bring it into form (third dimension) through aligned thought, feeling, and action. This is manifestation.

### Q: Are guides and masters separate beings or just future versions of me?

Both. They are **real beings** who have transcended time and space. They also are **reflections of your higher self**. In the fifth dimension, there is no separation. A master like Buddha can be both a distinct consciousness and an aspect of your own unified being. "All is one" is literal in the fifth dimension.

### Q: How does the liver metaphor help me understand the fifth dimension?

It shows that **relationship is relative to awareness**. Your liver has its own life, its own function, but it is not aware of you as its "higher self." If it could become aware, it would realize you are not separate but are **the larger context** in which it exists. Similarly, when you become aware, you realize your higher self is not separate but is **the larger context** in which you exist. Awareness bridges the dimensions.

### Q: What is the practical benefit of understanding the fifth dimension?

**Freedom from fear.** When you understand that your higher self is guiding you, that all possibilities exist, that death is not real, that you are eternal and loved—fear dissolves. You trust the process. You stop struggling. You align with your highest timeline and allow it to manifest. This is the practical magic of the fifth dimension.
