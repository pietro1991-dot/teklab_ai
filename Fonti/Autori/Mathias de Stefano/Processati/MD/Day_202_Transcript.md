## Overview

Day 202. Matias is still in Barcelona—the baby hasn't been born yet, playing with everyone's expectations.

He's tired today, moving slowly, needing to breathe more. But the teaching continues.

Today we connect with the **third eye chakra**—the center of **vision, intuition, perception beyond the physical.**

And we explore **Neptune**—the planet named after the **god of the seas**, the ruler of the **deep waters**, the archetype of the **subconscious ocean** that holds all things together.

But before diving into Neptune's symbolism, Matias makes something **critically important** clear:

**We are NOT talking about aliens. We are NOT talking about the Anunaki. We are talking about ARCHETYPES.**

The gods—Neptune, Poseidon, Zeus, Aphrodite—were not "beings from space that ancient people worshiped."

They were **CONCEPTS**—ways that ancient humans described **the unity of different aspects of reality.**

Just like we use the word **"archetype"** today, ancient people used the word **"god"** to describe **the light within matter, the essence that unifies diverse forms.**

So when we say "Neptune is the god of the ocean," we mean: **Neptune is the ARCHETYPE that represents all waters unified—the concept of the deep, the profound, the subconscious.**

With that foundation, let's explore what Neptune represents.

## Core Teaching

### The Name Neptune: The One Related to Water

The planet **Neptune** takes its name from the **Roman god Neptune**, who most people know by his Greek name: **Poseidon.**

But the name **Neptune** is actually much older than Rome—it comes from the **Etruscans**, the people who lived in the Italian peninsula **before** the Romans arrived.

The Etruscan people (who, like most Europeans, originally came from the **Kazakh steppes** in Central Asia) used these root words:

- **"Nepa"** = water
- **"Berita"** = humidity, wetness, moisture
- **"-unus"** (or "-onus") = the one who, the one related to

Put together: **"Nebitunus"** = **"The one related to water, the one who is wet."**

Over time, this became **"Neptunus"** in Latin, and then **"Neptune"** in English.

So **Neptune = the water-being, the lord of wetness, the god of the seas.**

### Poseidon: Brother of Zeus, Ruler of the Oceans

In **Greek mythology**, Neptune is called **Poseidon** (Ποσειδῶν).

Poseidon is the **brother of Zeus** (king of the sky) and **Hades** (king of the underworld).

The three brothers divided the cosmos:
- **Zeus** rules the **sky** (air, heaven, consciousness)
- **Poseidon** rules the **sea** (water, emotion, the subconscious)
- **Hades** rules the **underworld** (earth, death, the unconscious)

Poseidon is depicted with a **trident** (a three-pronged spear), riding the waves, commanding storms, causing earthquakes (he's also called the "Earth-Shaker").

He represents **the power of water in all its forms**—oceans, rivers, lakes, storms, floods.

But more than that, he represents **the DEPTH**—the part of reality that is **vast, mysterious, impossible to fully grasp.**

### Understanding Gods as ARCHETYPES, Not Beings

Before we go further, Matias pauses to make a **crucial distinction**:

**We are NOT saying that Neptune/Poseidon was an alien who came to Earth and controlled the waters.**

**We are NOT talking about the Anunnaki or beings from other dimensions who were worshiped as gods.**

**We are talking about CONCEPTS.**

Here's how it worked in ancient times:

Humans looked at the **diversity of water**—oceans, rivers, lakes, rain, steam, ice—and they asked:

**"What do all these different forms of water have in common? What UNIFIES them?"**

And they realized: **There is a LIGHT within all water. An essence. A quality that makes water, WATER.**

They didn't have the word **"archetype"** (that came later, from Carl Jung and depth psychology).

But they were doing **the exact same thing** we do when we talk about archetypes today.

They said: **"All the waters share one divine essence. We will call that essence 'the god of water'—Neptune, Poseidon."**

**The god was not a PERSON. The god was the CONCEPT—the unified light within diverse forms.**

Matias explains:

**"Divinity was not something OUTSIDE that created matter. Divinity was the MATTER ITSELF, unified by one attribute."**

In the past, humans honored **the light within objects**—the essence that all things of a kind share.

That light, that essence, that unifying principle—**that's what they called "a god."**

So when we study **Neptune as the god of the ocean**, we're studying:

**The archetype of DEPTH, the archetype of the SUBCONSCIOUS, the archetype of the PROFOUND MYSTERY that holds everything together.**

### The Deep Space Beyond Saturn

Here's something fascinating:

The planet **Neptune** wasn't discovered until **the 1800s** (1846, to be exact).

Before that, ancient astronomers could only see **up to Saturn** with the naked eye.

So the question arises: **If Neptune wasn't discovered until 200 years ago, why do we associate it with the ocean, the deep, the subconscious?**

The answer: **Because the SPACE beyond Saturn was always called "the deep."**

Ancient astrologers and mystics knew there was **something beyond Saturn**—some vast, mysterious region of space that they couldn't see or measure.

They called it:
- **"The Deep Space"**
- **"The Profound"**
- **"The Place That Holds Everything Together"**

They said: **"We can't see it. We can't perceive it. But it's THERE—surrounding us, holding the entire cosmos together, vast and incomprehensible."**

This is **exactly** what the ocean is to us on Earth:

**Vast. Deep. Mysterious. Holding everything together. Impossible to fully grasp.**

So when astronomers finally discovered the planet beyond Saturn in the 1800s, and they needed to name it, they chose **"Neptune"**—because it perfectly matched the ancient concept of **"the deep space, the ocean of the cosmos."**

**The planet was NAMED for the archetype that already existed.**

### Neptune as the Subconscious Ocean

In psychological and spiritual terms, **Neptune represents the SUBCONSCIOUS.**

Just like the ocean:
- The **subconscious** is vast, deep, and mostly hidden
- It **holds everything together** beneath the surface of conscious awareness
- It contains **all the emotions, memories, dreams, fears, and wisdom** that we can't always access
- It's **fluid, constantly moving, impossible to fully control**

**Conscious mind = the surface of the ocean (what we can see)**  
**Subconscious mind = the depths of the ocean (what we can't see but is always there)**

Neptune teaches:

**You can't live only on the surface. You must dive into the deep.**

**You can't control the ocean. You must learn to flow with it.**

**You can't grasp the entirety of the subconscious. But you can HONOR it, explore it, let it guide you.**

### The Attributes of Neptune in Astrology

In modern astrology, **Neptune** is associated with:

- **Dreams and visions** (the subconscious speaking)
- **Intuition and psychic ability** (perceiving beyond the physical)
- **Spirituality and mysticism** (the longing for union with the divine)
- **Art, music, poetry** (expressing the inexpressible)
- **Compassion and oneness** (dissolving boundaries, feeling connected to all)
- **Illusion and confusion** (when the boundaries dissolve TOO much, you lose yourself)
- **Escapism and addiction** (trying to avoid reality by drowning in the ocean)

**Positive Neptune**: The mystic, the artist, the empath, the dreamer who channels the divine  
**Negative Neptune**: The escapist, the addict, the victim, the one who can't distinguish reality from illusion

The key is **BALANCE**:

You need to **honor the deep** without **drowning in it.**

You need to **dive into the subconscious** without **losing yourself completely.**

### From Sacrifice to Concept: How Gods Evolved

Matias also clarifies the **evolution of how humans understood divinity**:

**Stage 1 (Ancient)**: Divinity is the **light within matter**—the essence that unifies all waters, all fires, all earths. This is the **archetype.**

**Stage 2 (Classical)**: Humans create **images and stories** of these archetypes—gods with personalities, relationships, dramas. This makes the concepts **easier to relate to.**

**Stage 3 (Medieval/Religious)**: The images become **literal**—people start to believe the gods are actual beings "out there" who must be worshiped, feared, obeyed.

**Stage 4 (Modern/Psychological)**: We return to the original understanding—**gods are archetypes, patterns, principles within reality and within us.**

Matias says: **"Maybe in the future, because we call them 'archetypes,' people will call the gods 'architects'—the ones that build reality."**

The point: **The CONCEPT is eternal. The NAME changes.**

Neptune, Poseidon, the Deep, the Subconscious, the Ocean of Unity—**it's all describing the same archetypal force.**

## Practice

### Diving into the Deep with Neptune's Guidance

Today's practice is about **honoring the subconscious ocean within you**—the vast, mysterious depths that hold your dreams, emotions, intuitions, and hidden wisdom.

**Step 1: Sit and Breathe**  
Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Place your fingers gently on your **third eye** (center of forehead, just above the bridge of your nose).

Breathe slowly and deeply. Feel yourself **sinking** beneath the surface of your busy thoughts.

**Step 2: Visualize the Ocean**  
Imagine you are standing on the **shore of a vast ocean** at twilight.

The water is calm, deep blue, stretching endlessly to the horizon.

This is your **subconscious mind**—the ocean within you.

**Step 3: Ask Neptune for Guidance**  
Speak (aloud or silently): **"Neptune, guide me into the deep. Show me what I need to see."**

You're not asking a "being"—you're invoking the **archetype**, the **principle** of deep wisdom, intuition, and the subconscious.

**Step 4: Dive Beneath the Surface**  
Visualize yourself **walking into the water**, then **diving beneath the surface.**

As you go deeper, the water becomes **darker, quieter, more mysterious.**

You're not afraid. You trust the ocean. You trust the deep.

**Step 5: Notice What Arises**  
As you float in the depths, **notice what appears**:

- A memory?
- A feeling?
- An image or symbol?
- A sense of peace or sadness?

**Don't judge it. Don't analyze it. Just OBSERVE.**

This is the subconscious speaking. This is Neptune's gift.

**Step 6: Sound the Vibration**  
Still visualizing yourself in the deep ocean, sound the vibration **"Hae"** three times.

Feel it resonate through the **water**, through your **third eye**, through the **depths of your mind.**

This is the frequency of **thought infused with life**—not dry, mental thinking, but **living, flowing, intuitive knowing.**

**Step 7: Speak the Statement**  
Say aloud: **"I Am the Life of Thoughts."**

Your thoughts are not separate from life. They are **alive**—flowing, moving, changing like water.

You honor the **ocean of thought** within you—the conscious AND the subconscious.

**Step 8: Return to the Surface**  
Visualize yourself **gently rising** back to the surface of the ocean.

You emerge renewed, carrying a **gift from the deep** (even if you're not sure what it is yet).

Thank Neptune. Thank the ocean. Open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**The Subconscious Check-In:**  
Before bed tonight, sit quietly and ask: **"What is my subconscious trying to tell me?"**

Don't force an answer. Just **listen.**

Notice:
- Dreams from last night
- Recurring emotions today
- Intuitive hunches you ignored
- Symbols or images that kept appearing

**Neptune speaks in symbols, feelings, and images—not logical words.**

**The Deep Dive:**  
At some point today, allow yourself to **feel deeply** without needing to "fix" or "solve."

If sadness arises—**feel it fully.**  
If joy arises—**feel it fully.**  
If confusion arises—**let it be.**

**This is honoring the ocean. Not controlling it.**

**Third Eye Activation:**  
Throughout the day, touch your **third eye** (forehead) and say: **"I Am the Life of Thoughts."**

Remind yourself: **Your thoughts are not static. They're flowing, alive, connected to the vast ocean of consciousness.**

### Applying This Teaching

The teaching today is: **Honor the deep. Don't try to control it.**

In our modern world, we live almost entirely on the **surface**:

- Constant stimulation
- Distraction
- Busyness
- Shallow thinking
- Avoiding difficult emotions

We're terrified of **the deep**—the subconscious, the unknown, the mysterious.

But **Neptune teaches**:

**The deep is where your WISDOM lives.**

**The deep is where your CREATIVITY is born.**

**The deep is where you connect to the INFINITE.**

You can't live a full life by staying on the surface.

You must **dive.**

Not recklessly (that's negative Neptune—addiction, escapism, drowning).

But **intentionally**:

- Meditation
- Dreamwork
- Journaling
- Art
- Music
- Therapy
- Spiritual practice

**These are the ways you dive into the deep and return with treasures.**

Neptune isn't asking you to **drown.**

Neptune is asking you to **TRUST THE OCEAN**—the vast subconscious that holds you, that knows more than your conscious mind ever will.

## Aquarius Physical Week Context

We are in the **Physical Week of Aquarius**, connecting with the **third eye chakra**—the center of vision and intuition.

Aquarius is the **networker**, the **visionary**, the one who sees the **whole system.**

And Neptune teaches: **The network extends into the INVISIBLE.**

You don't just see with your physical eyes. You see with your **third eye**—the eye that perceives **beyond the surface, into the deep.**

**Aquarius without Neptune = dry ideas, no depth, no mystery.**  
**Aquarius WITH Neptune = visionary wisdom, intuitive knowing, connection to the cosmic ocean.**

Together, they say: **Trust what you SEE beyond what you can prove.**

## Questions for Reflection

### Q: What does the name "Neptune" mean?

**"Neptune" comes from the Etruscan "Nebitunus"**: nepa (water) + berita (wet/humid) + unus (the one who). It means **"the one related to water, the one who is wet."** In Roman mythology, Neptune is the god of the seas; in Greek mythology, he's called **Poseidon**—brother of Zeus, ruler of oceans, storms, and earthquakes.

### Q: Are we talking about gods as actual beings or as archetypes?

**ARCHETYPES.** Matias is very clear: we are NOT talking about aliens, the Anunnaki, or beings from other dimensions. Ancient people used the word **"god"** to describe **the light within matter—the unifying essence of diverse forms.** Just like we use "archetype" today, they used "god" to describe **the concept that unifies all waters, all fires, all aspects of reality.**

### Q: How did ancient people understand divinity?

**Divinity was NOT something outside that created matter. Divinity was the MATTER ITSELF, unified by one attribute.** For example, all waters (oceans, rivers, lakes, rain) share one essence—that essence is "the god of water" (Neptune/Poseidon). **The god was the CONCEPT, not a person.** They honored the **light within objects**, the unifying principle.

### Q: Why is Neptune associated with the ocean if it wasn't discovered until the 1800s?

Because **the space beyond Saturn was always called "the Deep."** Ancient mystics knew there was a vast, mysterious region beyond what they could see—**"the profound, the place that holds everything together."** This perfectly describes both the **cosmic deep** and the **ocean**. When astronomers discovered the planet in 1846, they named it Neptune because it matched the ancient archetype of **"the deep space."**

### Q: What does Neptune represent psychologically and spiritually?

**Neptune represents the SUBCONSCIOUS**—the vast, deep, mysterious ocean of emotions, dreams, memories, and wisdom that lies beneath conscious awareness. It's associated with: **intuition, dreams, spirituality, art, compassion, oneness** (positive), and **illusion, confusion, escapism, addiction** (negative). The key: **dive into the deep without drowning.**

### Q: What's the difference between positive and negative Neptune?

**Positive Neptune**: The mystic, artist, empath, dreamer who **channels the divine, honors intuition, creates beauty, feels connected to all.**  
**Negative Neptune**: The escapist, addict, victim who **can't distinguish reality from illusion, drowns in emotion, avoids reality, loses boundaries.**  
The balance: **Honor the deep, dive intentionally, but don't lose yourself.**

### Q: What does "I Am the Life of Thoughts" mean?

Your thoughts are not **static, dry mental constructs.** They are **ALIVE—flowing, moving, changing like water.** When you say "I Am the Life of Thoughts," you recognize that **thinking is not separate from living.** Your thoughts are part of the **living ocean of consciousness**—both the conscious surface and the subconscious depths.
