## Introduction

Hi everyone , good afternoon , good evening.

So as you see , I am still here in Barcelona because the child is playing with us all. And she has n't been born yet. She decided to stay inside her mom. And nobody knows , too , when.

We all thought that I was able to come back tomorrow , but do n't. The important thing is that from the center , one knows where you 're supposed to be. Just let you know if the light cats or whatever , I do n't know if those things happen here , but there 's a lot of wind and storm outside. Let 's talk about the topic for today related to the third eye chara in the physical way and physical body with our planet for today , which is Neptune.

Sorry , I 'm a little bit low and slow. Nothing wrong. It 's all okay. It 's just that today I 'm slow.

## Guided Meditation

And I need to breathe much more. That 's it.

Okay. To begin with everything. Neptune , let 's talk about this planet and this god. The planet Neptune takes its name from the Roman god Neptune.

Then most of the people know with the name of the Greek tradition , which is Poseidon. Poseidon is the brother of News and Poseidon is the god of the seas , the oceans.

So that 's why usually we know the story of Poseidon more than Neptune , but it 's the same person. The name Neptune was named by the Trusting people. The Trusting people lived in the Italian peninsula , way before the Romans had arrived.

So this people are part of the European cultures that came from Kazakhstan.

Remember that all the European people came from the flatlands of the Kazakh. And from there they went to Europe and also down to Iran to all the countries named with Stan , the last part , and India and so on.

Okay.

So in those languages and cultures they call water as Nepal. Nepal is water and berita is something that humidity and wet that 's the meaning of berita.

So , and the Trusting people used to call when they say someone or the one who they used the name one , which is Ones.

So Ones , the one that does this.

So nebitunus , nebitunus is the name of the one related to the water. The one that is wet , the one that is wet , the one that is nabitunus.

So that 's the original of the name of Neptune.

The reason why we have this gods of water , god of fire is because in the beginning of our humanity , the idea was not having a god outside that created everything. It was different. The idea of the ancient one is that every water shaped a god is opposite. For example , you have the ocean , you have the rivers , you have the ocean rivers , lakes , steam , all this kind of different elements of water , but they all create the water itself as one.

So it 's because of this , because of this that they create a unity at being that represents all the waters.

So they call that the divinity of the water.

So for the in the past times , the divine was not the divine was not something outside that created matter. The divine was the matter itself unified by one attribute. Is the opposite to what we now believe about the gods? A point that I guess is important for me when we speak about gods and these different beings.

I guess it 's great to understand that what we are trying to do now talking about the gods and the attributes of this divinity of the Neptune and Seas and so on. We are not talking about aliens or the Anunnaki that came and did things and so on and they consider them gods of water and gods of no. We are not talking about that story. We are talking about concepts.

Talking about concepts , we have to remember that the divinity , sorry that the people in the past , did exactly the same as we are trying to do now. They took different things from the earth , from the reality and they put a concept on it creating one being from that object.

So from all the waters , they create the concept of the divinity of the water. And this is something really old.

So what we are doing now is speaking about the concepts of the gods is exactly the same.

Today we speak about archetype.

So we are speaking about the archetype of the god of the zodiac signs , the archetype of the planets and so on. We are not speaking about gods , specifically people or being that we are there in the sky. We are talking about archetype of our life with emotions and so on.

So in the very beginning , the humans did exactly the same. They did n't believe in gods. They put archetype. But the way in which they understood the archetype is to describe that those things has an inner light that they share.

So they have a light within that they have to share and they all share together , like all the waters share the same light and so on.

So light in the ancient language you would say , the hell , hell. And from the hell it comes the water and the water comes the name of the day which is the day the light. And also it creates the word divine , the water divine.

Okay , so a divinity , a god , is basically describing the light that objects has all together , the meaning of all the things together. Then with history , they created the images of these gods and they started to honor the images of these gods. But in the very beginning , they were doing exactly the same as we are doing today , which is honoring the archetype.

So maybe in the future , because we call them archetype , maybe because of the Mason people and where architects , they would , we would call the gods like architects , the ones that build the reality.

So for what we do today , speaking about these archetype , creating the concepts of our reality is the same thing that people in the past did with the gods.

So we are not speaking about unlocking all these people when we are talking about gods. We are just talking about the archetype of them. For what we say when we talk about the Neptune , we are not going to speak about the gods , but what we represent.

So this is why when we speak about the god of Neptune , we are not going to speak about the god , we are going to speak about what this god is representing.

## Q&A

So I will make this question that I do n't know if you. I do n't know if I am doing the right question. But my question is , have you ever thought through astrology , why we give to this planet , to Neptune , the attributes of the ocean , the deep emotions , the water that is on there , if this planet is not , had n't been discovered until meet 1800s.

So the 19th century , I do n't know if you get the question , but it 's about that is why we give it to you. We would use it. Why would we say it represents the waters , the deep waters , the ocean , because it 's Neptune , if the planet was discovered 200 years ago , and was named , but someone that would n't use astrology. To understand why we relate Neptune with the waters and the deep , let 's say , all the attributes that we put into Neptune describing the ocean , describing the deep waters , the emotions , the subconscious of the ocean and so on.

Before that , those concepts existed , but not describing the ocean. In the ancient times , they described the attributes of Neptune , not calling them Neptune , but calling them in a different way. Because in ancient times , they had no idea , specifically , that those other planets really existed , they had not a name for them specifically. They had not a name for those planets like we do today.

The name of Neptune was decided by astrophysics in the 19th century , so in the 1800s.

So before that , nobody called this planet like Neptune.

So the space behind Saturn and Trans , behind this space , they called it the deep space. They called it the deep space that hold everything , because they had no idea what was behind it. They had no idea what was after that.

So they put the concept of , there is something very deep in the sky that is surrounding us and holding us together. But we can not see it , we can not perceive it. It 's something so deep and so difficult to understand that it 's surrounding everything , all our reality , all the stars. And they start to describe this space like the profound , the place where you can find the whole being hold , all the things together.

And it 's so huge that you can not grab it , you can not take it by yourself.

So big that it holds you , you can not handle it. That 's the concept of that deep space behind the planets that they knew in that time.

So the attribute of Neptune of the planet existed before they discovered the planet. Of course , they had a name for it , they have the description for it , of course. But they had not the planet.

So in the 1800s , they discovered the planet and the astrophysics says this planet will be named Neptune. And when they named Neptune to the planet , all this concept of the deep of the thing that holds became into an ocean.

So it 's an analogy to describe the ocean.

Okay.

So something that was there that was used , that was known , but now it has an aim and it has an analogy. Oh , now we can explain this deep aspect like a notion because it 's Neptune.

So this vision of Neptune only has 200 years as an ocean. But it 's describing something that before existed , I did n't want to describe as ocean. I do n't know if you understand what I 'm saying. But I hope.

So with this , that I 'm just plain about Neptune , is the same for all the rest of the planets. And why? Because usually we have all this planets with names of gods. That has these attributes like if they were the gods.

But for example , Mars , Mars has not. Mars has not the energy of war. Mars is the god of war. Heirs are for the Greek.

But this does n't mean that in Mars there was a species that were warriors or that Mars is all about fighting and war and so on. It 's not related with that. What happened is that the gravity of Mars has this effect in us that pushes forward. That is like , who , move us ahead.

So because it 's pushing us to do something , we put the attributes , we as humans put the attributes of Mars to that energy. And we use the analogy of Mars describing the energy of the planet.

So that 's why we started to make a declaration of the story of the planet being the war , the warrior , the one that gets mad and so on.

So it 's not that this planet means that is that is the story or the interpretation that we put in Mars because of the energy that it has.

So it 's an analogy that helps into our psychology to understand something in the outside.

So for example , when we see the water and we see how the water flows and the water shapes the stones on the path.

So we say , oh , the water flows and shapes the stones goes beyond the stones. And that 's it , that 's the nature , that 's how it works and that 's it. There 's nothing more there is objected objective. Until we start to describe , say , logically , they ask because of the water.

And we start to say , the water flows and shows us the path. It shows us that we can shape any conflict , any enemy that we can go beyond. That we can move ahead and transform ourselves in anything we want.

So you can , you have to follow the path of the water. And with this example , they create the divinity , the divine of water. And they gave this divine the divine , the aspects of flowing and shaping the enemies and going beyond.

So we ask to this divine to guide us in the path and shape the conflicts in our life.

So as you see , we take the real things of the world and basically call it an interpretation. We create divinity that we then name like that in the nature.

So this is why we project our own psychological ideas in the things that has not the way for itself. We describe how the things from the outside determine our lives according to our point of view. This is why for some of us , Mars would be the planet that pushes forward and for others , Mars would be the planet of war. And all these things that we create that we perceive from the world is here inside our head.

Is n't our mind our perception of the reality? And it is so unlimited , so huge , so big , that is kind of impossible to handle it. Instead of us using it , it kind of use us. And it 's so big around us , invisible that we call that subconscious.

And this is what Neptune controls.

Remember this huge aspect that being invisible holds us , controllers. That 's the huge aspect of the subconscious , the nature gives the shape of an ocean. An ocean is impossible to handle , is so huge that you can not control it. The only thing that you can do in the ocean is to learn how to swim.

And that 's what the conscious have to do inside the subconscious. You can not control the subconscious. You can only learn how to swim , how to die in the subconscious. And where is all the subconscious controlling us?

And where is all the things that we do? Every action , everything that we experience , that is recorded in the memory of our body. And where is the memory in everything that we move that we do? And that movement that action is called emotion.

So I wrote today in the blog that emotion is basically the only thing that you without the need of modifying it , you can feel it within and the outside. Emotion is like the breach that connects exactly the subconscious within and the conscious outside. You can create an emotion in your brain inside , and it can modify the outside. And also something that can modify some emotion creating in the outside can control the inside.

So the emotion is the only aspect that does n't need a modification in order to be inside ourselves. Emotion is the same outside or inside. You can feel it exactly the same.

So basically Neptune is the subconscious. And this subconscious can be created only through the feelings , the sensations. Why is that? Because the whole things that are around us that controls us can be only perceived by the five senses.

And these five senses are the ones that are received , that receives information , that the code 's information , to be processed in the body.

So when you go to sleep , when you are awake , you receive data and data and data. When you go to sleep , you just , when you go to sleep , you are processing that information. You are just absorbing that and trying to put all information together.

So the cells regenerate with the new data.

So it can use it in another day.

So during the dreaming process , the generic moment , is the only moment when we directly has contact with the subconscious. It 's during the dreams when all this data is mixed. And in this moment , all this information is under the aspect of its under Neptune under the subconscious.

So all this information , all this information that we have served during the day , they have not rules. They are free. They go all around.

So no time , no space , no physical rules. And this is why all this data starts to mixed. This means that in the subconscious , there are no laws for time , no space. And this is the reason why we call this surrealist.

Because surrealist is true , which is above reality. And also , it 's outside the structures of reality. Because this is outside the structures of reality , we call it abstract.

So the abstraction and unrealistic abstraction , unrealistic abstraction. This is the two terms to describe these subconscious. The subconscious is the one that allows us to see other options to have intelligence imagination , to connect with something without limits.

So that 's what makes us be what we are. I want to say something that I do n't know how to put in words really. Not because it 's bad , but because I do n't know how to call it.

So to understand this , what we call spirituality or spiritual is the abstraction , is the abstraction of what the reality gives us. In such a way , our body is absorbing information from the environment constantly , and our brain tries to understand it , mixing that in the subconscious.

So this abstraction , surreal abstraction that we perceive as the connection with spirituality , is that process of understanding the things from another way. This is why some people , when they do , when they try to make a hallucinations , many people can connect with the spiritual world , because by abstraction they are able to connect with this environment of the subconscious.

Somehow we can say that everything that we know from the spiritual world is not something real , is something that is abstract. Because spirituality is basically the interpretation that each one of us has. Is one of us have , yes , has about its own perception of its own existence.

So each one of us has a different spirituality. Say , and from now on , whatever we can say of the spiritual world , it 's just that a perception of myself. This is what unconditional love is teaching us. This is what unconditional love is teaching us.

That each one has its own way to perceive existence. And this is why we can not judge the way in which others perceive that 's reality.

So what I am saying right now is that all information that I am giving comes from my own interpretation of my subconscious. But it 's mine. But maybe yours is different and you will have another way to perceive that information from your own subconscious. The subconscious is the filter of interpretation of spirituality.

So the reason why we share with speak , we learn , we study , we belong to cultures , it 's just to open to , to make our perception of the reality much more wider.

So Neptune is saying to us , we have to have our two eyes very wide open. One watching the outside to understand the world and the other one watching within to try to understand our way of understanding the world.

So usually humans , we are a threat of the subconscious because it 's so free. We are so , the subconscious is so free that we can not face it , it 's so difficult to face it.

So free so wide that we can handle it and our biology and our bodies , we 're designed to control life.

So we can handle something that is impossible to control. That 's why most of us humans , we can not face , we are a threat of facing the subconscious.

So one of the things that makes us be so afraid of the subconscious is that we are afraid of losing control. And one of the teachings that the energy of Neptune has for us is that it 's okay to lose control. That we can swim.

So the analogy to understand this is that you can not hold the water in between your hands. You can not hug the water , you ca n't hold it because it escapes. But you can learn how to float in the water. You can learn how to be hold in the water.

That 's the analogy to understand this energy. And how can we put it in a very human way that we have to allow ourselves to cry? To let the subconscious go out , to express it in the outer world , to let it all go. To allow yourself to express your emotions , not to hold it , thinking that if you hold it , if you do n't cry , you are in balance and it 's okay.

You have to learn to cry. We all have to. And also , if some people believe , I do n't know , we are spiritual , evolving beings that we have already done all the things that we 've done. All the things that we have to do and we have faced everything and I have to heal all my history.

If you need to cry again for the things that you thought you have healed , it 's okay. It does n't matter. Because we are not running to see who is the best one and who is much more in the center and not affected by emotions. Until we do n't know how to swim , we are not going to be able to stop feeling that.

## Daily Practice Elements

So , basically , you do n't learn to swim , watching the sea. You have to get wet. The vibration for today is die. The statement for today is , I am conscious balance.

The code for today is south. The negative aspect of the electromagnetic field of an astral nucleus is what we call south. And it 's the , this charged direction of the north tension. North and south constitute a torridal field that fits back itself.

The north pole expands energy. The south pole goes back to its center. And at the same time , they united in the external equator of this field. Both creating an electromagnetic wave that protects a sphere from the sea.

It is related with the past , the direction where we can from. Let 's go to the line. Let 's see how they will be very sound , let 's play in the back. Close your eyes , and concentrate to your breathing.

Take a deep breath , and start to think in the come aware of the environment you find yourself in , the room , the house , the sea deep deep , the village , the country , the continent and the world. Take a deep breath , become in myself the room where I find myself in , take a deep breath , the side become the house where I find myself in , take a deep breath , the side become the city where I find myself in , take a deep breath , expand in yourself and become in the country to find yourself in , the continent where I find myself in , I take a deep breath and I become the world where I find myself in my own dear breath and I see in front of me the light of my star the sun. Running , they can feel the sea of the moon spinning in front of me I can see Venus and in one side a bit further , Mars. Take a deep breath and watch farther , where you find Jupiter in Natural.

And farther in the deep space , I can see Trans and Neptune. There 's a tiny light way behind , Pluto , take a deep breath and recognize the entire solar system in their final subdue. I have served Neptune with its color that took place. I comprehend that Neptune is the limit of my space.

It 's the sphere that surrounds me , that holds all the existence. It 's my subcarnations and I am in the center , the tiny seat of the conscious. I recognize this subcarnations as the entire ocean that holds me , a tiny water drop. I recognize this subcarnations as the biggest land yet to know that holds the seat that I am waiting to grow.

The subcarnations is this space that holds me , that tourism me , that gives me the energy to blossom. And the seat of my conscious can only activate its divine light being flourished by these subcarnations. I extend my arms , catch an Neptune with my harness and rain in it into my third heart. I feel I perceive this planet spinning inside of my head.

As the door between my outer vision and my inner vision. I recognize this world inside of me , becoming the one that tourism my divine conscious. I invite hope , north and south , to balance this , my outer vision with my inner vision. I take you to breath and activate this vision with my son.

I am conscious balance , I am conscious balance. I am conscious balance , I am conscious balance. From my eyes I have started to bring this consciousness all around the body. I am curious in a stretch and young and in a twice at some time.

Come back here and now. I am conscious balance , I am conscious balance.
