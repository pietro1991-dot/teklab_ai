## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Ankles
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Destiny as the Will to Move Forward
- **Vibration:** `Tü`
- **Statement:** `I Am the Manifested Knowledge`
- **Code:** Aquarius - when it finds the best version of itself, when it finds itself, it frees from all pressure. It frees from everything that was worked on and finds the grace to innovate itself, of going out of the cave to enjoy life, to find new versions and flow. For that, like the wind, this spirit allows itself to be taken from one place to another without getting attached with anyone. Taking only what's necessary to reinvent itself with every step, knowing everybody, without being everyone's property, sharing its being.

## Overview

Today is the ankles chakra of the Physical Week of the month of Pisces. Tomorrow is our last day for the Pisces month.

The topic for today is **destiny**.

Culturally we tend to believe that destiny is equal to purpose. But purpose comes from the Latin "propositum" that means something that is put ahead, in front. So we relate this idea of putting something in front of us, where we are going to, with destiny.

We used to say that destiny is those things that guide you towards accomplishing something, that is a place where you are heading to, and that you cannot change it, that it is something straight like it should be. You cannot do anything—destiny is destiny.

But when we go to the etymology of destiny, we can tell that the origin of the word tells that destiny is exactly the opposite to what we believe.

---

## The Etymology of Destiny

### Destinare: To Stop Staring

**Destiny** comes from the Latin word **destinare**, that comes from two words:
- **De** = going beyond, to live, to move forward
- **Stinare** = an apophony of "stare"

**Stare** (which is to be, but not to be happy or to be sad) means **to be in a place**, to be somewhere related to a space.

The word is "stare." And then this word, like many words along our languages and history, suffered an apophony. Apophony means that the sounds transform into something beyond. That's why from "stare" it became "stinare," "destinare." It's just mistakes in the language.

### The Movement, Not the Place

Destiny comes from the idea of **leaving a place**, **going away from a place**, or **starting to move after a time of being staring at something**.

In English you have the word "stare at" that is the same origin of "stare." Okay, "stare" in Latin, "stare" in English is the same—to stare, watch something and don't move.

So **destiny** means "de" (to) means **to start to move and stop being staring at something**.

As you can see with this etymology, destiny doesn't mean the place where you are going to. It means exactly the opposite—**the movement that you do to stop being still in one place so you can move forward to reach that place**.

It's the movement that you start to do so you are not staring.

---

## Destiny Is the Will to Move

### Related to Will and Action

We can tell now that regarding this concept of destiny, the main idea of destiny is **the will of moving, of going towards a place**.

So destiny is related with the will, the action of deciding to go and move towards a purpose.

Destiny is talking about the will of doing something, of transforming something.

### Destiny Doesn't Exist as Fixed

Actually, in the universe doesn't exist this idea of destiny, that destiny is something wrapped that you cannot change and you are locked into that and it should happen anyway, it doesn't matter what you do. This concept in the universe doesn't really exist by itself.

**We are the ones deciding what is happening.**

---

## Why Does It Seem We Have a Destiny?

### The Question

But now the question would be: if it is like that, why even if we want to change things, sometimes they just happen even if we go against it?

---

## The Three Minds

### Conscious, Unconscious, Subconscious

In order to understand why sometimes it seems that we have a destiny, we have to go back to the main idea that we spoke many months ago, which is that the universe has **three different stages of the mind**:
- **Conscious**
- **Unconscious**
- **Subconscious**

The three of them are part of the universal mind. This means that the three of them are part of the divine thinking.

Once you remember these three different ways of thinking, we can acknowledge now that we are going to take decisions from:
- The subconscious
- The unconscious
- The conscious

---

## The Great Mistake

### Personality Is Not Conscious

One of the great mistakes that we usually do is that we think that the **conscious is related to the personality**. And it's not.

The **personality is in the unconscious**.

The **essence is the one that is conscious**, really. But the personality is unconscious.

### Where Decisions Come From

- The **body** takes decisions from the **subconscious** to make its survival every day
- The **personality**, the **soul** takes decisions through the **unconscious** in order to try to be accepted in the environment, by others, by culture and so on
- The **conscious** aspect is the one that takes decisions from the **essence**, the one that just is, in order to guide in balance the unconscious and the subconscious

---

## Why We Feel Controlled

### Divided Point of View

We have been divided so much in our point of view of the reality that we have been believing that if the things are not changing according to our will, if the things are still the same even if we choose another reality, we start to believe that we are controlled by a bigger mind that rules our life, like a hidden power or something like that that is controlling our systems.

### We Are the Bigger Mind

The reason we believe that someone else is deciding for us is because when we are here in the third dimension, it's just the third three-dimensional aspect of what we really are.

Remember the week of the dimensions that we already spoke about. The third dimension is just a manifestation of what we really are, just a tiny manifestation in the third dimension of what we really are, of our own being.

---

## Destiny Is Always Your Decision

### The Higher Self Chooses

By this we can understand that **the destiny is always your decision**—the highest consciousness decision.

The physical and the personality aspect of ourselves are just the manifested extension of the being that we are, of the choice that we made.

### Living Through Body and Soul

Due to our way of life, related so tied to the body and the soul, the subconscious and the unconscious, we live our lives believing that we have a destiny to accomplish that we cannot control.

When that destiny is a decision from the subconscious and the unconscious.

### Becoming Conscious

When we start to become aware, so conscious about ourselves, we also start to become able to guide our unconscious and our subconscious.

So when a person is living through the subconscious and the unconscious, they're still having this feeling, this perception that there is a destiny that controls us.

---

## Where Are the Three Minds?

### Locations in Our Being

- **Subconscious**: in the cells, in the memory of biology, in the DNA, in the tree of life of the family
- **Unconscious**: in the soul, in the astrology, in the culture, the traditions, the beliefs
- **Conscious**: in the essence, in the coherence, beyond personality

The essence of the conscious is beyond the idea of the ego, which is related to the unconscious.

---

## Healing the Relationship

### From Particle to Movement

When I become aware of myself, when I become conscious, I start to remember that in the universe, the only one that took the decision to move forward was myself.

From being just one particle, staying still, staring in the universe, it was my mind, the one that decided to move, that made the choice to keep going from one spot where I was staying still and start to move.

This means **destiny**—**to destine something**.

### Taking Control

This is why when I heal my relationship with the body, when I heal my relationship with the soul, and I start to live through the essence of the spirit, I can start to decide and control my own destiny.

Because **destiny is not those things that are written for me**. **Destiny is the intention that I set to move forward and exist.**

So don't blame the destiny on the place of being irresponsible of our own unconscious.

## Questions About Suffering

### Poor and Rich Are Morality

Now many questions can pop up, like for example: people that are suffering or people that are poor, they don't choose to be like that.

When we do this kind of thoughts, they are usually made from the point of view of the culture, of a tradition, of a belief, of a morality, which is not real. It's just a cultural perception of how things should be, but it's not related to reality.

### Nature Has No Poor or Rich

From the point of view of humanity, to be poor is something, to be rich is something—much more related to a status in a society.

But when you go to nature, the state of being poor is normality. **In nature, everyone is poor. In nature, everyone is rich.**

The only thing that makes us believe what is poor and what is rich is **human morality** according to our expectations of a society, a civilization. But for nature, there is no poor or rich.

Have you ever thought about that? When you look into nature, everyone is poor. Only humans believe in the separation between poor and rich.

---

## Judging Destiny Through Morality

### Not About Universal Reality

When we try to judge the destiny because some people are poor or some people are rich or this kind of things, we are not talking about the reality of the universe. We are talking about the point of view of morality in a human society.

In order to understand what destiny means, we have to take out the concepts of our civilizations to understand the reality.

### Everyone Decides Every Day

The reality is that everyone, every day, is deciding the destiny.

Why is the destiny related just to your decisions? Because **the future depends on what you decide every day that you wake up**.

---

## Destiny Across Time

### The Extension of a Being

I'm not speaking about humans. I'm speaking about the extension of a being in a third dimension.

The reason why a bird can fly is because thousands of birds and other animals, during thousands and millions of years, were trying to fly. And they reached it. They accomplished that.

They got to the point of flying because many were trying to fly. **It was the decision.** It was the decision of many beings in this dimension of willing to fly that created divers in the sky.

### A Matter of Time

As you see, the free will of destiny is not taken from one day to another by the personality. It is taken by a being throughout eternity.

**So don't blame the universe. It's just a matter of time.**

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortable. Close your eyes and concentrate in your breathing. Breathe deeply.

Take a deep breath and start to massage your body from your feet to your head. Pay attention to each part of it.

Begin by the feet, going up to the legs, genitals, hips and waist, back and chest, arms and shoulders, neck, face and head.

### Releasing Tension

Take a deep breath and make all the strength that you can, the pressure in your body. And breathe out, releasing the tension.

Once more, take a breath with all strength and let go, relax.

### Visualizing the Path

I visualize in front of me a path through the world towards the horizon.

I take a deep breath and move forward along this path.

### Remembering Choices

I bring to my memory all those decisions that I took that changed my life.

I bring to this path, as I walk to the horizon, the memory of each one of the choices that made a difference in my destiny.

### Connecting to the Ankles

I move softly my ankles, massage them.

I recognize that all of these moments, decisions that changed the destiny of my life, are connected to this chakra.

I can resist how I move in them. All the destinies of my life move through them.

### Each Step Is Knowledge

I recognize that **the destiny is in each step that I myself decided to take**.

I understand that each step is knowledge that takes me to the wisdom that makes me be. I am my own destiny.

My destiny is to walk.

### Projecting New Destiny

I take a deep breath and project a new destiny, activating the will to begin a new path with my vibration.

**Tü. Tü. Tü.**

**I am the manifested knowledge. I am the manifested knowledge.**

**I believe, for I am my destiny.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath and slowly start to bring all this consciousness throughout your body, massaging and warming.

Each one at your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Today, notice when you say "it's my destiny" or "I have no choice."

Ask: "Am I living from my conscious essence, or am I letting my unconscious and subconscious decide for me?"

### Each Step Is a Choice

Place your hands on your ankles. Feel the movement, the freedom.

Recognize: **every step you take is a choice**. You are creating your destiny with each movement.

### Releasing "Fixed Destiny"

If you've been believing your life is predetermined, take a moment to feel the power of choice.

Say: "I am not locked into a destiny. I am the will to move forward. I decide."

The ankles chakra connects us to our ability to move, to walk our path, to choose our direction. Destiny here means: "I have the power to move. My path is mine to create."

Tomorrow we complete Pisces with the toroid chakra and begin the journey into Aries—the month of action, will, and new beginnings.

## Q&A

### Q: If destiny is my choice, why do bad things happen to good people?

From the perspective of the higher consciousness (essence), what appears "bad" from the personality's view may serve the growth of the being across lifetimes. Also, we're often living from unconscious and subconscious patterns, not conscious choice.

### Q: How do I access my conscious mind to make better destiny?

Through practices like meditation, self-reflection, healing trauma (subconscious), and questioning beliefs (unconscious). The more aware you become, the more you can consciously choose.

### Q: Does this mean free will is real?

Yes, but not in the way we usually think. The personality doesn't have as much free will as we believe. But the essence—the full being across all dimensions and time—absolutely has free will. Your task is to align your personality with your essence.

### Q: What about collective destiny, like nations or humanity?

Same principle. The collective consciousness of many beings creates the collective destiny. If humanity is unconscious, we create unconscious destinies (war, destruction). If we become conscious, we create consciously.

### Q: How long does it take to change my destiny?

For the personality, it might seem slow. For the essence, time doesn't exist the same way. Every choice ripples across dimensions. Some changes are instant, some take lifetimes. Don't judge by the personality's timeline.

### Q: If poor and rich are just human constructs, should I stop wanting abundance?

The teaching isn't to stop wanting abundance. It's to stop judging your worth or destiny based on human-created concepts. Nature is abundantly rich in its own way. Align with natural abundance, not societal morality.

### Q: Can I change a "bad" destiny once it's in motion?

There is no "bad" destiny locked in. There are only patterns (unconscious and subconscious) playing out. As you become conscious, you can shift the patterns. The destiny is always in your movement—you can change direction at any step.
