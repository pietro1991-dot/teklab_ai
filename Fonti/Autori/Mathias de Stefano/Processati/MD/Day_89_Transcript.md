# Day 89 - Center and Periphery

## Overview

Today connects with ankles chakra in Libra Physical Week, exploring center and periphery. Ankles represent adjustment, destiny—portals where you adjust direction, destiny of where you're going.

It's October 31—Halloween. Scary night. We're in Egypt channeling pyramids, bringing dark and light masters together. Egypt energy is intense—ancient, powerful. Perfect night to talk about center and periphery.

Yesterday we talked about life and death. Today we talk about center (fixed point, axis) and periphery (movement around that center). These concepts show how observation creates reality.

This teaching might scare you more than Halloween. Why? Because I'm going to tell you something radical: God doesn't exist. Only mind exists. Observer and observed are projections. Only observation exists.

Ready? Let's go.

## Core Teaching

### Center: The Axis That Activates Potential

Center comes from Greek kenyon—meaning target, axis, fixed point. Center is point around which everything else rotates.

When you're at center, you're at axis. You're not moving around—you're fixed point that allows movement to happen.

Center is place where you activate your potential. When you're centered, you access all tools, all possibilities. You're in position to observe all periphery around you.

This is why being center is important. Not because you're superior, but because you're in position to activate, to access, to observe.

### Periphery: The Movement Around Center

Periphery comes from Greek peri (around) + ferein (to take, to carry). Periphery is movement around center, things carried around fixed point.

Periphery is not worse than center—it's complementary. Without periphery, center has nothing to observe. Without center, periphery has no axis to rotate around.

Center is self. Periphery is others, environment, perception. You (center) observe others (periphery). Others (center) observe you (periphery). Constantly changing.

This is rhythm—fifth law. Everything flows in and out. You're center, then periphery, then center again. Pendulum swings.

### Egocentrism Misunderstood

When we hear "egocentric," we think: selfish person who thinks only about themselves, believes they're superior.

But egocentrism is not that. Egocentrism is simply being at center—at axis, at point where you activate potential.

Being center is not about believing you're better. It's about being in position to observe, access tools, activate possibilities.

Confusion happened because people at center sometimes forget periphery. They activate potential but don't share, don't observe others. They become rigid, stuck.

But true center is not rigid. True center is aware of periphery. You activate your potential to serve whole, not just yourself.

### The Hamster Wheel: Point and Circle Are Same

Imagine hamster wheel. Hamster runs on wheel—wheel spins around axis.

From hamster's perspective (periphery), it's running forward, moving. From axis perspective (center), hamster is staying in same place, wheel spinning.

Who's right? Both. Point and circle are same thing viewed from different perspectives.

When you're on periphery (running), you feel movement, progress. When you're at center (axis), you see: it's all one spot, different angles.

This is fractal perception. Universe is one spot observing itself through infinite perspectives. You're one angle. Others are other angles. All looking at same center from different periphery points.

### Observer, Observed, Observation: Only Observation Exists

Here's where teaching gets radical.

We think there are three things: observer (me), observed (you/world), observation (act of perceiving).

But this is illusion. There are not three things. There's only one: observation.

Observer and observed are concepts mind creates to make sense of observation. But they're not real. They're projections.

What exists? Only observation. Only perception happening. "Observer" is just label for one angle of observation. "Observed" is just label for another angle.

When you observe me, and I observe you—who is observer, who is observed? Both. Neither. Only observation exists between us.

This is why universe is one spot observing itself. There's no separate observer. Only observation from infinite angles.

### God Doesn't Exist—Only Mind

Now the scary part.

God doesn't exist. What exists? Mind.

First law: mentality. Everything is mind. Mind creates reality. There is no God outside mind creating things. There is only mind observing, projecting, creating.

When you pray to God, you're praying to mind. When you feel God, you're feeling mind. When you say God created universe, you're saying mind created universe.

God is projection mind creates to make sense of observation. But God is not real. Mind is real.

This is not atheism. This is understanding: what you call God is mind observing itself, creating reality through observation.

Universe is not creation of external God. Universe is mind experiencing itself through infinite perspectives—infinite observations.

You are not separate from God. You are not creation of God. You are angle of mind observing itself. You are observation happening.

This is why "I Am" is only name for God. Because God is not thing—God is observation. I Am observing. That's all.

### Universe Is One Spot Observing Itself

Put it all together:

Universe is one spot (center) observing itself through infinite perspectives (periphery).

Each perspective thinks it's separate observer. But there's no separation. Only observation from different angles.

You (center) observe world (periphery). World (center) observes you (periphery). But really, it's one observation—one mind experiencing itself from different angles.

This is why when you're centered, you access whole. Because you are whole, just looking from one angle.

This is why being center is not selfish. Because center is not separate from periphery. They're same thing—different perspectives.

Halloween teaches: scary things are just perspectives. What looks like monster from one angle looks like teacher from another. Only observation exists. Change angle, change reality.

## Practice: Ankles Chakra Activation

**Preparation:**
- Comfortable position
- Stretch body, massage, warm
- Let weight fall, relax, focus breathing

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation sequence

**Ankles Work:**

19. Pay attention to higher self above you
20. Help descend through crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacral, root, knees, ankles
21. Ankles are portals of destiny—where you adjust direction constantly
22. With both hands, massage ankles deeply (circles around ankle bones, Achilles tendon, tops of feet)
23. Feel ankles as pivot points—center adjusting to periphery constantly
24. Perceive: when you stand, ankles hold you centered. When you walk, ankles adjust direction.
25. Ask: Am I centered in my observation? Or lost in periphery (others' perspectives)?
26. Practice: Be center (observe periphery without losing yourself). Be periphery (move around center without rigidity).

**Integration:**

27. Relax hands, allow perceive sensations at ankles
28. Vibrate: SSfú
29. State: "I am evolution in constant adjustment" (repeat)
30. Feel yourself as center observing periphery. Then as periphery being observed by center. Then as observation only—no separation.
31. Remember: God doesn't exist. Mind exists. You are mind observing itself.
32. Stretch, warm, massage throughout all portals of joints
33. Return here now, open eyes

**Closing:** Drink lots of water, rest to assimilate. Feel Egypt energy tonight—dark and light masters meeting at center, observed from periphery, all one observation.

## Key Insights

1. Center (kenyon) means target, axis—fixed point that activates potential
2. Periphery (peri+ferein) means around+carry—movement around center
3. Being center is not selfish—it's being in position to activate potential, observe periphery
4. Egocentrism misunderstood: not selfish, just being at axis (confusion when center forgets periphery)
5. True center is aware of periphery—activates potential to serve whole
6. Hamster wheel: point and circle same thing from different perspectives (fractal perception)
7. Observer, observed, observation—only observation exists (other two are mind projections)
8. When you observe me and I observe you, who is observer? Both, neither—only observation exists
9. Universe is one spot observing itself through infinite perspectives
10. God doesn't exist—only mind exists (first law: mentality, mind creates reality)
11. God is projection mind creates to make sense of observation—not external thing
12. You are not separate from God—you are angle of mind observing itself
13. "I Am" is only name for God because God is observation (I Am observing)
14. You (center) observe world (periphery), world observes you—one observation, different angles
15. Ankles adjust direction constantly—center adjusting to periphery, destiny pivoting

## Integration

**Daily:** Notice when you're center (observing) and when you're periphery (being observed). Practice both. Remember: no separation, only observation.

**Weekly:** Ankles chakra practice, massage deeply. Feel pivot points adjusting. Ask: Am I centered or lost in periphery?

**Monthly:** Identify one area where you confuse egocentrism (being center) with selfishness. How can you activate potential from center while serving periphery?

**Ongoing:** Remember: God doesn't exist, mind exists. When you pray, meditate, feel divine—you're experiencing mind observing itself. You are that observation.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If God doesn't exist, what am I praying to?**
A: Mind. When you pray, you're accessing mind observing itself. What you call God is mind. First law: mentality—everything is mind creating reality through observation.

**Q: How is being center not selfish?**
A: Center is axis that activates potential. When you're centered, you access tools to serve whole. Selfish is when center forgets periphery (rigid, stuck). True center serves.

**Q: If only observation exists, am I real?**
A: You are real as observation. "You" as separate observer is projection mind creates. What's real is observation happening. You are that—angle of mind experiencing itself.

**Q: Why do we create concept of observer and observed if only observation exists?**
A: Mind needs structure to make sense of experience. Observer/observed are tools mind uses. Useful, but not ultimate reality. Ultimate reality: observation only.

**Q: What about people who need to believe in external God?**
A: Let them. Their experience of God is their observation. When they're ready, they'll understand: God is mind. Until then, projection serves them.

**Q: How does hamster wheel teaching apply to life?**
A: When you feel stuck (running but not progressing), remember: from center perspective, you're exactly where you need to be. Change perspective, change experience.

**Q: If universe is one spot, why does it feel separate?**
A: Fractal perception. One spot observing itself from infinite angles. Each angle feels separate, but it's illusion. Halloween teaching: monster from one angle, teacher from another.

**Q: How do I practice being center without becoming rigid?**
A: Be aware of periphery. Center activates potential, but periphery shows you where to direct it. Rhythm—swing between center and periphery. Don't get stuck at either.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching on Halloween brings scariest truth: God doesn't exist. Only mind exists. Observer and observed are projections. Only observation exists.

Center (kenyon=axis) is where you activate potential. Periphery (peri+ferein=around) is movement around that center. You're both—center observing periphery, periphery being observed by center. Rhythm swings you between.

Egocentrism is not selfish—it's being at center, accessing tools. Confusion happens when center forgets periphery (rigid, stuck). True center serves whole by activating potential.

Hamster wheel shows: point and circle are same thing from different perspectives. When you run (periphery), you feel movement. From axis (center), it's one spot, infinite angles. Both true.

Observer, observed, observation—mind creates first two to make sense of third. But only observation is real. When you observe me and I observe you, there's no separation. Only observation between us.

Universe is one spot observing itself through infinite perspectives. You are one angle. Others are other angles. All looking at same center from different periphery points.

God doesn't exist. Mind exists. First law: mentality—everything is mind. God is projection mind creates to understand observation. When you pray to God, you're praying to mind. When you feel God, you're feeling mind observing itself. You are that observation.

"I Am" is only name for God because God is not thing—God is observation happening. I Am observing. That's all.

Your ankles adjust direction constantly—center pivoting to periphery, destiny changing angles. When you're centered, you access whole (because you are whole from one angle). When you move to periphery, you experience whole from different angle.

You are evolution in constant adjustment when you recognize: no separation between center and periphery, observer and observed, you and God. Only observation exists. Only mind experiencing itself. Only I Am.

That's the teaching. That's Halloween truth. Scarier than any monster, more liberating than any prayer.
