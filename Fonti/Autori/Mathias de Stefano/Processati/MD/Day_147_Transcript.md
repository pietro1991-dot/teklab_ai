## Overview

On December 28th, we explore the great continent of Africa and its connection to the root chakra of the planet. Matias humorously notes he's quite full after being invited to eat asado (Argentine barbecue) 40 minutes before the session—so if he looks a bit tired, it's from digestion, not lack of sleep!

Today's teaching corrects a common mistake: some people believe Egypt is in the Middle East, but only a tiny part of Egypt (the Sinai Peninsula) is in the Middle East. The rest of Egypt is in Africa. Today, we speak about Africa from Africa.

Africa represents the root chakra—the seed of life, the origin point from which everything expands. It was the center of Pangea, the ancient supercontinent, and it is the birthplace of humanity. Understanding Africa's role helps us understand our own roots and the foundation of all human consciousness.

## Core Teaching

### Understanding Antipodes

Today, Matias wrote about antipodes in the blog. An antipode is the exact place on the opposite side of a sphere from where you find yourself. It's the mirror point on the other side of the planet.

The most known antipode in the world is the North Pole and the South Pole—the Arctic and the Antarctic. Those are antipodes, opposite sides of Earth.

If you move from the North Pole and start to move around a sphere, no matter where you go, you will always have an antipode. Of course, you've heard in cartoons about digging a hole in the ground and appearing in China on the other side. But it's not like that in every part of the world.

The only two countries where you can dig a hole and appear in China on the other side are Argentina and Chile. Those are the only places in the world where you can do that.

### The Antipode Map

The most curious thing is that if you look at the map, not many places in the world are antipodes to other countries. Not many countries match exactly as antipodes.

One of the really strange things about an antipode map is that the biggest territories in the world that match exactly as antipodes are:
- **China and Chile/Argentina** (the largest matching territories)
- **Spain/Portugal and New Zealand** (the only territory that matches exactly for the whole country)

Other countries that touch the whole territory but are smaller include:
- **Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador** with the islands of Indonesia
- **Paraguay** with Taiwan
- **Brazil** with the Philippines (but mainly islands, not much territory to compare)

The rest of the territories are mainly oceanic and tiny islands. Other territories that touch from the other side are northern Russia and Siberia with Antarctica, but nobody really lives there, so it's not affecting humans.

### Continents Match with Oceans

The coolest thing now is that the rest of the continents match exactly with oceans:
- **Entire North America** sits exactly in the Indian Ocean
- **Australia** sits exactly in the northern North Atlantic Ocean
- **Part of Asia** goes all in the South Atlantic and part of the Pacific
- **All Africa and Europe** match exactly in the Pacific Ocean

Basically, there is no continent being the antipode of another continent. That's a curious thing. The coolest thing about this polarity is that every continent matches exactly with water on the other side.

This is like a balanced thing. One side has earth and air, the other side has water and fire (fire because of the volcanoes in every island). This polarity, these antipodes, create a balance between the four elements.

This also talks about a world looking for balance.

### Africa: The Center of Pangea

The reason why I wanted to explain about antipodes is because of the importance of Africa. The antipode of Africa is the biggest ocean of all—the Pacific Ocean.

The Pacific Ocean is a really big tectonic plate that has no continent on it. This means that all the other continents were connected, united as one. And in exactly the other side, we can find this big ocean where there's nothing.

If you've ever seen a map of Pangea, look for one on the internet. You will see that when all the continents were together matching each one of them, in the center there was Africa.

Africa was the center of everything. Pangea comes from the Greek "Pan," which means everything, and "Gaia," which means earth. So Pangea is all the earth, all the lands together.

Of course, on the other side, we have this great ocean. All the seas were together. In Greek, "Pan" means everything, and "Thalassa" means seas or oceans. So Panthalassa is the great ocean on the other side of the world.

All of it was connected, was together. **Africa is the center of Pangea. And exactly on the opposite side, we have the center of Panthalassa.**

### Africa: The Seed of Expansion

Watching the map of Pangea, we can see that Africa is basically the continent that pushed all the islands from around toward itself to create this great continent. And then it pushed back, expanding outward, creating the continents around.

What does this movement tell us? This movement of expansion and contraction is exactly the same as we do as breathing. Like the universe is doing with the galaxy, with everything. The Earth, through thousands of years, does exactly the same with the continental movements.

The expansion of the continents, the separation of continents, and they come back again—this movement happens through thousands of years. This means that the seed of life from where everything comes to be sown and create a seed, and then expands to create around like a forest—**that origin is Africa.**

### We Are Not From Monkeys

Just to have this idea clear: we are not coming from monkeys. We are not coming from apes. We are coming from hominids.

There are a lot of people saying we come from monkeys. No, we don't come from monkeys. That's another root of history. The monkeys are coming from the apes, and we humans are coming from the hominids.

Both of them, we come from a common ancestor—but it is not apes or those things. It's a being that was before.

I say this because **we humans have evolved in Africa.** That's why Africa is so important for us—because we started in Africa. But not as monkeys, but as hominids.

### The Evolution in Africa

The hominids started in South Africa in the region of the southern part of the continent. From there, they started to migrate north, following the lakes of the eastern part of Africa. They reached Ethiopia.

From Ethiopia, there was this big leap of evolution in humans. They started to reach northern territories as never before.

It's been like 2 million years that the hominids—the different kinds of hominids—were living only in Africa before they started to expand through other regions.

### The Sahel and Migration North

One of the main regions that they went through is the Sahel. But the Sahel was not like today. It was not the big desert that we know today—it was much more related with the Sahel region.

The Sahel is the region in the southern part of northern Africa in the countries of Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria—all these territories in that part of Africa. The Sahel means "the coast," and it's green, has lakes, and so on.

The rest of the continent was like that. It was all covered with green fields, big lakes, trees, and so on. All these people moved and lived in the Sahel during a long time.

By the other side, they went to the rivers: the Nile, the Tigris, the Euphrates in the Persian Gulf. And on the other side, the Indus River in India and Pakistan. And that's where homosapiens started to appear.

### Africa: The Root Chakra

Now we're going to see why Africa is the seed that helps the world to activate its Kundalini. Remember that the Kundalini of the planet begins in Turkey and goes all around the mountains of the world to Patagonia.

But why is Africa not inside that Kundalini? Now we're going into that.

**Africa has its own Kundalini energy.** Africa represents the root chakra. Africa is the seed. It's the gene also where the fire of the Kundalini starts.

Africa is the ovaries and the spermatozoids that create life—that get together and create life. From the roots, from the power of earth, it starts to create this energy, this engine that moves all the energy up.

**Without the energy of Africa activating this, we wouldn't have the flow of the Kundalini around the planet.**

### The Sky with Stars

The statement for today is "I Am the Sky with Stars." This speaks to Africa's role as the foundation—the earth from which we gaze up at the infinite sky.

Africa is both grounded (the root) and expansive (the sky). It holds the stars—the infinite potential, the seeds of all humanity, the origin points of consciousness.

Just as we look up from the earth and see the stars, Africa is the ground from which all human consciousness gazes upward, seeking to understand its celestial origins.

### The Fire at the Root

The root chakra is often misunderstood as passive or static. But in Africa, we see that the root is actually fire—it's the engine, the generator, the power source.

The Kundalini fire begins at the root. Without Africa activating this fire, without the seed germinating, without the ovaries and spermatozoids coming together, there is no life, no movement, no evolution.

Africa teaches us that being rooted doesn't mean being stuck. It means being so grounded in your origin that you have the power to expand, to create, to birth new realities—just as Pangea expanded from Africa's center.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Connect with your own root chakra today. Stand barefoot on the earth if possible. Feel your foundation, your origins, your ancestral roots. Then look up at the sky and recognize that being deeply rooted gives you the power to reach toward the infinite. You are both earth and stars.

### Applying This Teaching

Reflect on your own roots—your family, your ancestors, your origins. Are you ashamed of your roots, or do you honor them as the seed from which you've grown? Africa teaches us that honoring our origins gives us the power to expand. Without acknowledging where we come from, we cannot move forward with power and purpose.

## Q&A

### Q: What is an antipode and why does it matter?

An antipode is the exact opposite point on the other side of a sphere. It matters because it reveals Earth's balance. Every continent matches with an ocean on the opposite side, creating a balance between the four elements: earth and air on one side, water and fire (from volcanoes) on the other.

### Q: Why is Africa called the center of Pangea?

When all continents were united as Pangea, Africa was literally in the center. It was the point from which all continents expanded outward. On the exact opposite side of the planet was Panthalassa, the great ocean. Africa is the seed from which all landmasses grew.

### Q: How does Africa relate to human evolution?

Hominids (not monkeys) evolved in South Africa about 2 million years ago. They migrated north along the lakes of East Africa and reached Ethiopia, where there was a great leap in human evolution. From there, homosapiens spread to the rivers—the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, and Indus—and eventually populated the entire world.

### Q: What does "Africa has its own Kundalini energy" mean?

While the planetary Kundalini runs from Turkey through the mountain ranges to Patagonia, Africa generates the Kundalini fire itself. Africa is the root chakra—the engine, the generator. It's where the fire begins. Without Africa activating this energy, the entire planetary Kundalini wouldn't flow.

### Q: Why is the statement "I Am the Sky with Stars"?

This statement reflects Africa's dual nature. As the root chakra, Africa is deeply grounded in the earth. But the root is also where we stand to gaze up at the infinite sky. Africa holds both—the foundation (earth) and the infinite potential (sky with stars). It's rooted and expansive simultaneously.

### Q: What is the difference between expansion and contraction in continental movement?

The continents moved toward Africa to create Pangea (contraction), then expanded outward to create the separate continents we have today (expansion). This mirrors breathing—inhale and exhale. It's the pulse of the planet, the rhythm of creation. Africa is the center of this breath.

### Q: How can I work with my own root chakra using this teaching?

Recognize that your root chakra is not passive or static—it's the fire, the engine, the generator of your life force. Honor your origins, your ancestors, your roots. This grounding gives you the power to expand, to create, to reach toward your infinite potential. Stand on the earth and look at the stars—you are both.

### Q: What happened to the Sahel region?

The Sahel was once green with lakes, rivers, and forests. Early hominids lived there for a long time. Over thousands of years, climate change turned it into the Sahara Desert we know today. But the Sahel region in the south (Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria) is still the green coast, preserving the name and some of the ancient landscape.
