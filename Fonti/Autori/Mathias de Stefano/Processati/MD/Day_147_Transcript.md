## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning , afternoon , afternoon. Good evening. Welcome today to this connection with the Ruth chara in the physical week of the Sagittarius month.

So today , maybe if you sing a little bit tired , it 's because I am really tired , but not because I did n't sleep well , it 's just because I have been invited to eat an egg yolk and I just finished eating 40 minutes ago.

So I 'm really full.

So if you see me with this face , like , well , I 'm doing it in the Jason.

So today , the topic is Africa , the great content.

So some people sometimes made a mistake believing that Egypt is in middle east , but just a tiny part of Egypt is in middle east , which is the Since Visual. The rest of Egypt is in Africa.

Today , we are talking about Africa from Africa , at least.

Today , I wrote about this in the blog , so I invite you to see the blog.

So even though I wrote a lot about it , what we are going to do is to make a summary of this continent related to ourselves.

So let 's begin with this idea. I wrote today about antidote. The antidote of a place that is basically the exact place in the opposite side of where you find yourself or some spot.

So in a sphere , an antibody is the opposite side of one spot.

So the most known antibody in the world is the north pole and the south pole.

Okay , so north pole is one spot and the antibody it means the opposite side is the south pole.

So from the Arctic and the Antarctic , those are antidote.

So that 's why that 's the most known antibody.

So if I move the north pole and I start to move around a sphere , it does n't matter where I go , I will always have an antibody around a sphere.

Okay?

So of course you have heard about this in the cartoons that when someone is doing a hole in the ground and they appear in the other side , there 's China. But it 's not like that in every part of the world , of course. The only two countries where you can dig a hole and appear in the other side , in China is Argentina and Chile.

So those are the only places of the world where you can do that. But the most curious thing is that if you look into the map , not many places in the world are antidote. Not many countries are antidote.

So one of the real strange things about an antibody map is that the biggest territories in the world that of countries , that matches exactly as antidote , the biggest territories , is China and Chile Argentina. Those are the only ones bigger ones. The other territory that is exactly straight like this is Spain and New Zealand. Spain , Portugal and New Zealand.

This is the only territory that matches exactly in the whole country.

So the other countries that kind of touch the whole territory , but they are smaller territories. And many islands , not continents , is Peru , Bolivia and Ecuador , which touches the islands of Indonesia , Indonesia , and then Paraguay with Taiwan and Brazil with Philippines. But they are mainly islands.

So not much territory to compare. The rest of the territories are mainly oceanic. And at tiny islands. Also other territories that touch themselves from the other side are northern , northern Russia and Siberia with Antarctica.

But they do n't really leave anyone there.

So it 's not difficult to say this is affecting humans basically. Just that.

So the coolest thing now is that the rest of the continents matches exactly in the oceans.

So for example , we have the entire North America , feed exactly in the Indian ocean. The Australia feed exactly in the northern , north of the Atlantic Ocean. Part of Asia goes all in the south Atlantic and part of the Pacific. And all Africa and Europe matches exactly in the Pacific Ocean.

So basically there is no continent being the anti-bode of another continent. And that 's a curious thing.

So the coolest thing about this polarity is that every continent will match exactly with water in the other side. And this is like a balanced thing. This means we have one side , earth and air. And the other side we have water and fire.

And fire because of the volcanoes in every island.

So this polarity , this antibodies , are kind of creating a balance between the four elements.

So this also talks about a world looking for balance.

The reason why I wanted to explain about the antibodies is because the importance of Africa. Because the antibody of Africa is the biggest ocean of all , the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is a really big , tectonic plate that has no continent on it.

So this means that all the other continents were connected , united , ones all together. And in exactly the other side we can find this big ocean where there 's no nothing.

Okay , there.

So I do n't know if you have seen any time the map of Pandya. But I invite you to see one in the internet , look for Pandya map. And you will see it better.

So when you see the continent of Pandya thousands and billions of years ago , you will see that Africa is the center of all the continents. When all the continents were together , matching each one of them. In the center there was Africa.

Okay.

So Africa was the center of everything. Pandya comes from the Greek Pan , which is everything. And Gia that means earth.

Okay.

So Pandya is all the earth 's all the lands together. And of course , in the other side , we have this great ocean.

So all the seas were together.

So in Greek , all everything is Pan and seas , oceans is set.

So Panthalasa is the great ocean in the other side of the world. All of it was connected was together. Africa is the center of Pandya. And exactly in the other side , in the opposite , we have the center of Panthalasa.

So which today is the remains of Panthalasa is the Pacific Ocean. That 's the reflection.

So watching this map , we can see that Africa is basically the continent that pushed all the islands from around towards itself to create this great continent. And then pushed back expanding outside , creating the continents around. What this movement tells to us.

So this movement of expansion and contraction is exactly the same as we do as breathing. Like the universe is doing with the galaxy , with the universe , everything. The earth , through thousands of years , is exactly the same with the continental movements , I do n't know the word , meaning.

So when the continents basically move around.

So the expansion of the continents , the separation of continents , and they come back again.

Okay , once and again , this movement through thousands of years.

So this means that the seed of life from where everything comes to be so and create a seed. And then expands to create around like this forest. That origin is Africa.

So just to have this idea , we are not coming from the monkeys. We are not coming from apes. We are coming from the homicide. There 's a lot of people saying , we come from monkeys.

## Energy Work

Now we do n't come from monkeys. That 's another root of history. The monkeys are coming from the apes. And we humans are coming from the homicide.

So both of them , we come from a common ancestor. They come from common ancestor , but it is not apes or those things.

Okay , it 's a think that was before. And I say this because we humans have evolved in Africa. That 's why Africa is so important for us because we started in Africa. But not as monkeys , but as homicide.

So the homicide started in South Africa in the region of the south part of the continent.

So from there they started to migrate north following the legs of the eastern part of Africa. And they reached Ethiopia. From Ethiopia , there was this big leap of evolution on humans. And they started to reach north and territories as never before.

It 's been like 2 million years that the humans were living only in Africa before they , that not humans.

Sorry , that the homicide , the different kinds of homicide were living in Africa. Before they started to expand through the other regions. One of the main regions that they went through is the Share. But the Share was not like today.

It was not the big desert that we know today. It was much more related with the Share. The Share is the region , is the south and region of the north and part of Africa. In the countries of Ghana , logo , Benin , Nigeria , all these territories that are in that part of Africa is called the She.

And the She means the She is green , has legs and so on.

So the rest of the continent was like that. It was all covered with all these green fields and big legs and trees and so on.

So all these people moved and lived in the Share during a long time. And by the other side , they went to the rivers. The Nile , the reason , the euphrates , the euphrates in the person Gulf. And in the other side , the Indo River in India and Pakistan.

And there is where the homosapids up and starts to appear.

So now we are going to see why Africa is this seed that helps the world to activate its Kundalini.

Remember that the Kundalini of Africa begins in Turkey and it goes all around the mountains of the world and in Patagonia. But why Africa is not inside that Kundalini?

Okay , so now we 're going into that.

So Africa has its own Kundalini energy. Africa represents the root chara. Africa is the seed.

So is the gene also where the fire of the Kundalini starts. Africa is the bells and the spermatozoids that creates life that get together and creates the life.

So from the roots from the power of earth , it starts to create this energy , this engine that moves all the energy up. And without the energy of Africa , activate this , we would n't have the flow of the Kundalini around the planet.

So Africa is related to the sexuality , to the root chara , to the genitals of the world. And it 's also related to the roots to our ancestors. That brings the nutrients in order to be able to grow and to flower.

So remember , Africa is related with the root chara , so the sexuality. And in our genitals is where the energy is created in order to push the energy up , to push the energy above and connect to the spiritual world. Look what we 're doing in our path. We are not starting from the genitals going up to bring the energy from the earth into the skies to the spiritual world , where we are doing totally the opposite.

We are going from the crown chara to the root chara , downloading the spirit into the matter , to bring that consciousness here. Because usually what we do is to use the Kundalini energy to bring all the power of the generals towards the mind , the head. And we go into the mind or the spirit saying that we have to live the body behind in order to connect with the divinity or with the mind on the top. And when we do that , we take all the energy from the genitals in order to create ideas , mind and go to the spirit.

So this is the same thing that we did in history as more spiritual or more mental. The civilization begins to be much more energy we take from Africa.

So remember now that what we are doing basically unconscious is to take all this energy from Africa as we take this energy from our own genitals in order to go to the heavens and forget about this earth. And we are unaware when we are unconscious and we want to escape from this reality. We want to go to the mind , we want to go to the divine. What we usually do is to take all the energy we can from this matter , from this reality , to use it in order to light and go above into the heavens.

So the image that we have is that when we are conscious about all this , we use the sexual energy to create all this energy going up. But it does n't go up to the skies. It just gets into the crown chara and opens creating these torus and flourishing again the low chara , the root chara.

So it creates the spinning.

So it 's feeding back the energy. The energy of the own machine. Otherwise when you just use this energy and just go up , you waste your energy.

Some day you wo n't have any more energy because this is like for example , you see a rocket and you use it only once because you put all the fire and you create this all fire below. And it goes up and you waste all the fuel that you have and someday somehow you will lose this potential and you will start to fall down because you have no much fuel. No fear of all that 's the image.

So why Africa is suffering so much? Two reasons , but one of them is that nobody is paying attention to Africa because we are using the energy of Africa to go up. But the only way in which you can go up is pay attention to Africa because Africa is the continent that gives us the energy to go up. This is why the Atlanta civilization used this energy of Africa because the Kundalini of Africa begins in South Africa going up through the limits of the tectonic plateau between Western Africa and Eastern Africa.

From that crack of the plateau , the energy starts to move from the Lake Malawi , Tanganyika , Albert Victoria and it goes up through the valleys of Ethiopia and Eritrea and it goes down in the ocean and in the sea , in the Red Sea , ending in the sea and in the peninsula.

So all this energy is also connected by the river , the Nile , of course , from the Lake Victoria going up towards the Mediterranean Sea.

So this is why the Atlanta civilization used this energy of the Nile to create the conscious civilization to go all over the world because they understood that Africa is the continent that pushed the Kundalini up in order to go to the whole world. That 's why the pyramid I am here in the pyramid. And I am in this region because the pyramid is the summary of all the energy that comes from the darkenberg chain of mountains in South Africa. Going all straight from the south to the north and it 's here in the pyramid where all this information of the seat starts to be concentrated.

And from here you can go to Turkey and start to spread all the energy through the world. That 's why I 'm here. That 's why which is this place.

So the reason why we have so many problems in Africa , according to the first reason is because it creates so much energy that all the rest of the countries that are looking through the mind , they use the energy of Africa in order to sustain their own beliefs and way of living.

So this is how to say an English exploitation. This is an abuse basically as an abuse of energy and matter and everything. Yeah and also because Africa represents the sexuality , the first will.

So the childhood , the first seat on being created also is reflecting the problems that we have in the world with this abuse on the child. Sexual abuse sexual control on others abuse of power etc.

So basically , Africa is the reflection of what happened in the whole humanity.

So the second reason of this continent of the suffering of this continent is basically innocence. And innocence is not only related to be the victims because the energy is from the childhood in this continent.

So it 's not about the innocence of being the victim of everyone. It 's also the innocence of not knowing what we 're doing , what we are using.

So that 's why from innocence , you can do a lot of harm.

Okay , a lot of pain. You can create a lot of pain.

So the reason why Africa is suffering is not also , it 's not just because outer , reasons , but by the same innocence from the same territory.

So innocence is not only , for example , a kid is innocence when it does something wrong. Because it has no idea what is good , what is bad , it 's just testing. It 's just practicing what is good , what is wrong.

So it 's also innocence that you have no idea how it works.

Okay , so that 's why the same population creates a lot of pain because of innocence. The second reason , so the second reason would be that the weather and the geography of Africa made the population of Africa , to survive better than in any other continent. Because it was always hot , so they were able to move around. They had no limits in between each other.

They were all tribes and they were sharing and going all around without any limits.

So all these groups moving around Africa had a very different way of organization than in Europe and Asia because of the cold in Asia , in Europe , the weather was so hard.

So strong related to the cold that they had to create civilizations , they had to create an economy , armies to take care of the territory.

So they started to basically protect their regions and they created civilizations to defend their. The only things that they could. That they could harvest in those lands.

So they were trying to to survive in such a way that took them to evolve. Through thousands of years in civilizations , okay , which is totally different from what happened in Africa in Africa. It was too much land and they could move around , they could migrate and there was no problem with that.

So this created a concept in Africa that made them live from nature , not depending from anything else than nature. And that was the advantage that the European people had on Africa over Africa by taking control taking power on Africa because they were just tribes moving around.

So it was easier to control them.

So that 's why in the past centuries Africa has been living this abused of other countries because they they had they had n't the. And they had not been living this on creating their own systems and in the last 100 years. They just received all the systems as the republics democracy from Europe. Creating countries that had no sense in Africa because they caught everything.

So no reason. And they had no system that they had no clue how to. They had not the opportunity to grow themselves to create their own system. That was the problem they could n't create their own system.

So.

So the power of Africa will come back the day in which they will be able to. And they will create their own system again.

So remember that what we are doing is to download this information from the spirit to live. Plant in the matter.

So if we follow the path of the Kundalini towards the spirit.

Now the Kundalini is attaching to South America so changing the way of seeing and if we in South America are able to change the perception of the world.

So we can be also able to connect with the divine in Antarctica which goes straight to the. To Africa. Again by the Und by the the torus , okay.

So Africa will rise up again only if in South America we do our job to come back to the spirit. And of course Chile , Argentina and Uruguay are the countries that must see. Into the other side which is China , Mongolia and Siberia. To take this information from the other side which is the I am and do it in a different way.

To correct the essence of the I am from Asia and put it in a new vision in South America. To change the vision. I guess that we will need like I do n't know 200 years more because you all know how we are.

So what we are doing is we are going to be more important in the world.

So the Clean people is much more revolutionary and aligned to manifest things. But we will try to make it great team. I do n't know. Let 's go to the information for today.

## Daily Practice Elements

The vibration for today is thought. The statement for today is I am the celestial fruit. The code for today is conscious. And within that oceanic current lies the being that learned how to swing.

The one that became aware of the current strength and the deepest of the ocean , the deepest of the ocean. And instead of letting itself be drowned by them uses the forces on its favor. Being conscious is seeing the surroundings clearly without escaping from from from it. How to use it in favor of a common good.

This way the swimmers know the swimmer knows when and how to use the current. How and when to get out , respecting the ocean without being swallowed by it. Let 's go to the alignment. See the comfortable focus on your breathing and remember that your body is the summary of all the animal kingdom.
