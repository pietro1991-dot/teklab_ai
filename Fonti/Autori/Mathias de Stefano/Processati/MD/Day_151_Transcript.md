## Overview

Happy New Year! On January 1st, 2021, we begin the month of Capricorn—a month of hard work, structures, and patterns. Matias humorously apologizes to all the water, air, and fire signs because Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the god of agriculture and hard work. This is not a light, dreamy month—this is about building, understanding structures, and learning how to use the tools we've created.

The Roman culture celebrated Saturnalia at the end of the year, asking Saturn for a good harvest. Capricorn energy is about working the land, being patient, doing things with time and care. The mantra for this month is "I Use"—learning how to use our patterns, structures, and beliefs as tools rather than prisons.

Today we begin exploring the Seven Hermetic Laws, starting with Mentalism—the understanding that everything in existence is a perception of the mind. We're diving deep into patterns and structures this month, not to destroy them, but to understand why we need them and how to use them consciously.

## Core Teaching

### Welcome to Capricorn: The Month of Work

Today we begin with Capricorn, the Capricorn month. Capricorn is a month of work. This month is ruled by Saturn, related to the earth, the land. Saturn is the god of agriculture, the one that sows the land.

It's about the work, about the harvest. The energy of Capricorn is related to the hard work of earth, being patient, doing things with a lot of time.

The concept is to work the land. This is why the mantra related to Capricorn energy is **"I Use."**

### The Slow Process of Capricorn

The energy of Capricorn is related to the hard work of earth, and it's very slow. The process of the earth is very slow.

For example, related to the work of the land: when you go to plow the lands, from the moment you plow the land until the moment you harvest the fruit, there are many stages. You have so many things to do in the middle.

You plow the soil, you put the seed, you take care of the seed, you water the seed. Then you have to take care of the insects and so on. Until you harvest something, it can take months. Many things. It's a long process.

Of course, in this energy of work, we all know about Capricorn: working so hard the land, the fields, for so long—when the result is not what you were expecting, frustration comes. You don't know what to do. Capricorn energy is the hard worker, the one that says the work never ends. We have to look for perfection all the time.

### Capricorn and Perfection

We always have some conflict with what we have done. It could be better. The work could be better. The results could be better.

Capricorn people used to think always that it's not enough. That nothing is really enough. That we have to do it better, that we have to do it in a different way.

That's why it's so hard for Capricorn people to enjoy a result. Because the process is very slow, and you always think that it can be better.

### Understanding Patterns: What Is a Pattern?

First of all, pattern—what does it mean? We've spoken about this, but pattern comes from the Indo-European languages from "pater," that means the protector, the one that holds, that protects.

That's why the origin of "father" is "pater." The name "father," which was the one that protected the family, the father of families, is the one that took care of the group, of the tribe.

As you may see, "pater" is not a name related to man at the beginning. It's related to the one that protects. But then, in the families in the past, they used the concept of "pater" to refer to the man that was taking care of the family.

**When we speak about pattern, we speak about things that protect us. Things that make us feel safe.**

### Why We Created Patterns

All the fences that we start to create, these patterns that we create, we start to put one over the other to create like a diary, to create like a house, like a place where we can take care of our weakness, protecting ourselves from the outside.

All this began in a time where we had no order in our lives. We had no governments, we had no society. It began in a moment where we needed these shields to protect ourselves.

Because the animals could kill us and eat us. The people that were hunting there could hunt us too. It was so complicated, so difficult, that all we could think about was to protect ourselves.

**This means that everything we start to put one over another, all these things around to protect ourselves, are the ones that we call patterns.**

### The Three Levels of Patterns

The patterns that we have are structured in physical, emotional, and mental:

**Physical Patterns:**
One pattern that we all have that is physical is to dress up, to have clothes. Why? Because we felt that we were vulnerable in ancient times.

We need to protect ourselves because the body was so weak. We need to protect the genitals, the chest, the belly, everything—because of the weather, because of the animals, or whatever. So we started to create these coats of leather, we started to create these tissues around us to cover us.

This created the idea that I would be protected if I dress up. That's what created the culture—depending on the collar, the waist you dress, the texture, whatever. It's like we are protecting ourselves from the weakness we have inside.

**Emotional Patterns:**
When we go to the emotional level, all the emotional patterns are created because of the tribes. "Tribe" is a Latin word that comes from "tribus," which is like a group of three.

This tribe is related to mom, dad, and the kids living together. In order for the tribe to survive, they need to create these emotional links, bonds, so they could be all together. Because if the family split, they would get killed or would have less opportunities to survive in nature.

For example, in ancient times, you would have some fear of the sunset because there was a real threat outside—a big tiger, for example. The tigers can kill you because they see in the night and we cannot see in the night.

So this family, this tribe, set this pattern: when the sun is in the horizon, we go all to the cave and nobody gets out.

Thousands of years later, we have the same problem. Our family says, "You're not going to go out," and you say, "But why? I have this conflict with my dad or my mom arguing with them because they don't let me go outside during the night with my friends."

**That's a pattern—a very old pattern since the time we lived in the caves, and it still goes on.**

**Mental Patterns:**
The patterns of the mind—for example, many of us working in consciousness call ourselves "light workers" or "light warriors." But why? It's a pattern.

The pattern comes from very old existence, very old reality: humans lived through light. In ancient times, humans wake up at the sunrise. When the sunrise comes, the light comes, so you can work again—harvesting or so on. You follow the light, the path of light through the sky.

So you say, "I am following the light." And the other ones were hunting, so they were "light warriors."

This is an idea we've been receiving since the very beginning of humans—being light workers and light warriors because we were following the light of the sun.

But this doesn't work on other planets. This doesn't work for people living in the depth of the ocean, for the animals that only go out during the night.

**This is just a belief. Everything that we do, that we express, is a belief. Everything that we do is a pattern.**

### The Matrix: A Network of Patterns

All these patterns are connected. All these patterns are connected in a network. This network is the one that we call the **matrix.**

The matrix is a network of patterns that helps us to connect with everyone outside. If it weren't because of this network of patterns, the matrix that we are creating, we wouldn't be able to speak to one another.

For example, you are there and I am here because we are full with patterns. Otherwise, you are not going to be able to understand me and I wouldn't be here.

When someone doesn't have patterns—those kind of people that you cannot talk to, or that we say are crazy or lost or whatever—it's like you don't understand language, you don't understand anything.

**All these patterns in the matrix are the ones that help you to connect in a network with everyone. So they are useful.**

### Patterns Are Not Bad

We have been through a process in which patterns and matrix have been treated in a very negative way. I don't know where it started. I don't know what was the point where people started to take this as a bad thing.

But the problem of patterns and matrix is because we don't know how to use them. It's not the patterns and matrix. **It's because we don't know how to use them. That's the main problem that we have.**

### Structures: Gathering Patterns

The gathering of all these patterns, of all these tools, is what we call a structure. A structure comes from the Latin word meaning "to put many things together."

So a structure is to put all these little tools that we call patterns all together in a way in which you can feel stable. Stability.

**Patterns create structures of thinking.** This means that we are basically a structure of beliefs. Everything that we have in our minds, in our reality, the way in which we live, is constantly a network, a matrix—a matrix that is structured with many patterns of beliefs.

### Everything Is Perception

Let's go now into something I spoke about a long time ago: the perception of things.

Everything that you perceive—everything—every sense, the touch, the sight, the smell, everything—is not real. It's just a perception of your brain interpreting data from the outside. But it's not really what you are feeling or receiving.

It's what your brain is believing or thinking.

Recognizing this, we will acknowledge that everything that is outside is just a perception of the inside.

**What this means is that everything that I am using to protect myself from existence is just an idea of my mind, a perception.**

### The First Hermetic Law: Mentalism

If all this is a network of beliefs, the only possible thing that really exists is the one that believes. And who is the only one able to believe, to be a believer? **The mind. Mind is the only one.**

Basically, everything that exists in the universe, every structure and pattern and network, is the product of an unlimited mind, an eternal mind, that is excited to limit itself.

Why would an eternal, unlimited mind find limits? Basically, the reason why it looks for limits is because an unlimited mind cannot find. It can only imagine but cannot create, because it doesn't have patterns to create.

**An limited mind—and by limited we are speaking about patterns—is able to manifest the thoughts.**

Basically, the existence is possible because of the structures and patterns of Capricorn.

**That is the first law and the unique law of the universe: mentality. Everything that exists in this reality, in every reality, is just a perception of the mind. That's mentality.**

### Don't Burn the House

The reason why we are willing to break with all these patterns is because there's a moment when living inside a house where everyone has been saying, "You have to be here protected, don't go outside because the house is the only one able to protect you"—there's something inside that says, "No, but I want to open the door and go outside and play, to see things, to watch others, to travel, to have new experiences."

We usually have this conflict when we say we have to get rid of the patterns.

The image when we say "I have to get rid of the patterns" is like if one day you just figure out, "Oh my god, I now know that there is a world outside my house!" So in order to see that world, you break the windows, throw them away, kick the door, break the door, set fire to the door and the windows. You go to the bed and throw the bed on the balcony and put fire on it. You go to the kitchen, take the oven, and throw it through the window and burn it with fire.

**That would be the image of taking your patterns away.**

The only thing that you have to do in order to get rid of your patterns is just to make a copy of the key of the house. And just open the door, go outside, go on a trip, and then you come back and everyone would be there and you can sleep in your bed.

**What Capricorn would say is: don't break the door of the house, don't break the windows, don't burn the oven. Because they have a meaning, they have a purpose there.**

If you want to go somewhere different, to do something different because you are so tired of being in this house, you can go out, have some adventures, make a trip around the world. And then you can come back and you will have everything here.

When you go outside on a trip, you can see your life, your hometown, your family from a very different perspective. You can see your home, your house from a different point of view.

**That's why if you burn the house, if you just take it all into ashes, you won't have your roots. You won't have your tools.**

### Learning How to Use Patterns

Throughout all this month, what we are going to do is go through all these structures and patterns that we have created—that maybe we want to burn and break and get rid of—but we have to understand how they work and why we have created them.

Because we created everything through our minds. And that is the first law and the unique law of the universe: mentality.

2. Every book in this library is a pattern, a structure. This is the hall of the halls for your inner books.

3. Recognize the structure of your beliefs.

4. Walk around this library and pay attention. Are there books on the floor? Open books? Are the shelves organized or chaotic?

5. Pay attention because this library contains all the information of your own records—in the subconscious and the conscious.

6. Walk toward the books of your beliefs and examine some of them.

7. Find a book that calls your attention. Watch the shape of the book, the color of the book, the title, and the content.

8. Recognize: What is your biggest pattern of belief? The answer is in this book.

9. Take this book with your hand and go through the hall, the main hall, until you find a very big stair.

10. Above, there is an office with a lot of light.

11. Pay attention to this stair. Is it a clean stair? Is it easy to go up? Is it difficult? Is it empty or filled with things?

12. Recognize how this stair feels to you.

13. I recognize that I find myself on the floor of the subconscious, surrounded by all the books, all the patterns since the very first human until me. All the data that made myself possible.

14. There is the unconscious—the path that I have to take to the office of the conscience.

15. I will take this book with me so I can bring clarity to this pattern of belief that I have.

16. I start to go up through the stairs of the unconscious.

17. In my path, I remember through the ascension to the consciousness.

18. I arrive at the office of the conscious.

19. I open the book in front of me, allowing the information to come to me—no judging, just perceiving emotions, colors, images, words.

20. I recognize that this pattern is part of my path toward my divinity.

21. Repeat: **I am the stair to the divine. I am the stair to the divine. I am the stair to the divine.**

22. With my both hands, I hold the book and take it open to my crown chakra.

23. I send the intention to open the records of this belief, to set me free from that belief, and use it in my own benefit.

24. **I use. I use. I use.**

25. Take a deep breath.

### Closing

1. Come back slowly here and now by bringing this consciousness all around your body.

2. Stretch the body, being aware of all the bones.

3. Remind yourself that from today and the next days, you will have your Akashic records opened to be aware of the patterns you have to work with.

4. Not to break the patterns or structures, but to be aware of them, to become conscious of how to use them.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Write down all those beliefs—the ones that make you who you are. What are those beliefs? This is your starting point for the Capricorn month. You're not breaking these beliefs; you're becoming aware of them so you can use them consciously.

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout this month, instead of trying to destroy your patterns and structures, ask: "How can I use this? What purpose does this serve? Why did I create this protection?" Remember, you're not escaping the house—you're learning to open the door and explore, knowing you can always come back to your foundation.

## Q&A

### Q: Why is Capricorn considered a "hard" month?

Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the god of agriculture and hard work. It's about working the land—a slow, patient process with many stages. Capricorn energy is perfectionistic and never satisfied, always thinking things could be better. This makes it challenging but also deeply transformative if we learn to work with it.

### Q: What is a pattern, and why do we have them?

A pattern comes from "pater," meaning protector. Patterns are things we created to protect ourselves—to make us feel safe. They exist on physical (clothing), emotional (family bonds), and mental (beliefs like "light worker") levels. They were created when we had no order, no society, and needed shields to survive.

### Q: Is the matrix bad? Should we escape it?

No. The matrix is simply a network of patterns that helps us connect with everyone outside. Without this network, we couldn't communicate or understand each other. The problem is not the matrix itself—it's that we don't know how to use it consciously. Capricorn month teaches us how to use it.

### Q: What is the Hermetic Law of Mentalism?

Mentalism is the first and only true law: everything that exists in this reality is a perception of the mind. All structures, patterns, and networks are products of an unlimited mind that chose to limit itself through patterns in order to manifest and create. Without limitations (patterns), the mind can only imagine but cannot create.

### Q: Why do you say "don't burn the house"?

Many spiritual teachings say "get rid of your patterns" or "escape the matrix." Matias says this is like burning your house down to see what's outside. Instead, just make a copy of the key, open the door, go explore, and then come back. Your roots, your tools, your foundation—they have purpose. Don't destroy them; learn to use them.

### Q: How can I work with patterns instead of against them?

First, become aware of them. Write them down. See them clearly. Then ask: "Why did I create this? What does this protect? How can I use this consciously?" Patterns are tools. The goal is not to break them but to understand them and use them in your own benefit.

### Q: What does "I Am the Stair to the Divine" mean?

You are the connection between the subconscious (the library of all patterns) and the conscious (the office of light). You are the stair that brings awareness from the depths to the light. Every pattern you make conscious becomes a step on your stairway to divinity.

### Q: Why do we need to go through Capricorn before Pisces (dreams)?

In order to download heaven on earth, to bring information from dreams and imagination to the ground, you need structures. Otherwise, dreams won't be manifested in this reality. Capricorn builds the foundation so Pisces can dream into form.
