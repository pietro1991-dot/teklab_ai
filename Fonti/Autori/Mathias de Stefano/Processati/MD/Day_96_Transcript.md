## Introduction

Hi everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

As you may see , I am wet.

The reason why I 'm wet like this is because at last , it began the wet season here in Cairo and started to the winter.

So , wet season , it 's like the new year.

So , here I am enjoying the water.

So , the information for today is somehow related to the things that we spoke yesterday. The topic that we discussed yesterday. Yesterday , we said about all these stories , all the things that a lot of people are talking about and a lot of people are sharing. There is so much information right now in the internet , in YouTube , in social media.

So , many things that we have , like we are doing now , all the things that we are receiving. And there are so many stories that we do n't know really what is true and what is not. And sometimes what we do , we basically do , is to believe everything. And that 's what a lot of people are living today.

We have so much confusion because we do n't know specifically where is the origin of all of us that we receive , that we read , that we see in the network , there 's a lot of people that just believe in everything that is around there.

So , confusion , so there 's so much confusion today because of the huge amount of information that we are receiving constantly that we can not know why is true anymore. Basically , we have to go to the origin of why we have this confusion.

So , we can not understand the origin of it from where we got all these confusion today. First of all , we have to understand that what we call information from the very beginning of humanity is not something that you take from the outside , but information describes a process to get to the knowledge.

So , first of all , to understand , I start to create this information. We have to understand the origin of the word , the origin of the word , information , information comes from the Latin , sorry , sorry. Information comes from the Latin in formation is basics , okay , is basics in formation.

So , this means to be in the process of getting informed , okay , informed.

So , information means the process of taking forms , of taking forms of something , okay.

So , it 's the process of taking form of the things.

So , when you take the information from the outside , the data from the outside , information is not the data from the outside.

So , you have a data , you have something outside , and you absorb that data from the outside , and the process of understanding that data , you start to form to make shape of that data. Shape in the data would be to form the data , okay , that would be.

So , when we speak about information , this means that we are forming the informing the data , trying to make it better , okay.

So , from the very beginning of humans , of humanity , the concept of having information is not to catch things from the outside , is to start to walk the path of experience to try to gain wisdom by the experience of life as you start to get in shape , as you form yourself in life in a constant process of living.

So , this process of information , this process of being in shape as I evolve , it 's not born from the idea of the magical or the divine idea of finding yourself. No , it starts because of the needs , and we have three basic needs that pushes through evolution , which is hunger , the need to be safe , and to look at place where you can sleep.

So , to sleep , to eat and to be safe , are the three main things that every human in the first humans walking around the planet , from that moment , they moved all the civilizations and cultures from those three basic needs.

So , all the process of information would be from those three , okay.

So , in the history of how most sapiens sapiens , which has been the last 300,000 years , humans have been designing their cultures , their religions , their societies , their civilizations , everything , from this only three basis , to eat , to sleep and to feel safe. Basically , we have these three basic needs that creates everything , that creates all the concepts of our societies. And from that , from this three , we create one goal , which is to feel plenty in these three things.

So , we create a goal. If we accomplish that goal of commodity , it means that we had accomplished to feel , to feel our food , to feel the place where we sleep , to feel our need of safety. And that only word is happiness , okay? Happiness.

So , happiness would be the concept that makes you recognize that you accomplish these three needs.

So , this is why the pursuit of happiness is basically to fulfill these three main needs.

So , by acknowledging this , that these three main basic needs are looking for happiness , so , religion , and politics , the society , we 'll try to look to , to cover these three needs.

So , you feel the comfort of happiness. If religion accomplished to give you this , to give you this three , to take care of these three main needs.

So , comfortably , you will have faith. And you will have faith in that religion , because that religion gives you happiness. If it 's a politician , politics , that give you this three.

So , you will trust that politician , okay? Because you are comfortable now , because someone gave the three basics to you. If I want to control the happiness of people , all that I have to do is to use what they eat , what they were they sleep and they 're safety. Main thing.

By creating an enemy outside the system creates the perfect solution for you to feel safe , because by having an enemy outside , you will need someone to protect you , which is safety , okay?

So , it 's easy. The other thing , my house , my family , my cave , my hand , my property. If I feel that someone can take that out , so I will trust anyone who says I would take care of that for you. And the , on the other one , by food.

If someone comes and says I will ensure the food , the three main foods that you have in your life , in order to leave.

So , I would trust that person , my happiness , my life. By controlling these three , any other system , any system , can control you.

So , this is why they would say to you , I would make you happy. If you feel happy with me , it 's all perfect.

So , this is why I am the script today. He said , the pursuit of happiness. No , the pursuit of happiness is the path of ignorance , because whoever looks for happiness in life is just because you are looking for these three needs , without it.

So , one important thing to know , do n't think that , that now , we should not look for happiness because that 's ignorance. No , we are humans. And with this that I am explaining , I 'm not saying that the pursuit of happiness is bad , okay? I 'm not saying that looking for happiness is for just because you 're an ignorant and you should not be an ignorant.

No , we are all ignorant , because we 're humans. We have a body. And we need to eat , we need to sleep , we need to feel safe.

So , it 's normal , it 's normal. We have a body. We are here trying to understand the world to survive in the world.

So , do n't think that that thing is bad. Do n't think that the pursuit of happiness now , it does n't have any sense. No , no , it 's useful here in this reality as a human , trying to survive in this reality. The thing is that we should not say that this is bad , that ignorance and the pursuit of happiness is bad.

The only thing that we have to acknowledge about all this process is information. Information. The whole path of evolution is the path of taking shape , to be in shape , which is in form , in formation , okay?

So , if you are not evolving , if you do n't realize that you need to change the way in which you eat , you sleep , you take care of yourself. This three main needs will keep you constantly even in the past , like in the same moment , trying to survive each moment.

So , you are not information. You are not informed. You are just focused in three main needs.

So , in the last 300 years , thanks to the Industrial Revolution , we had for the first time in 300,000 years , just in the last 300 of all that amount of time , we had education. For the first time , we have schools , we created schools.

So , in this period of polarization , what the system did was to bring all the kids that were used to all the population of humans that were used to to live for eating , to sleep , and to be safe , they took it into schools to feed them with data.

So , it was kind of information. This was the mental information.

So , they would say , now we need to feed you a fuss of data.

So , you feel comfortable with what you know.

So , you feel safe taking decisions.

So , basically , it 's the three needs , but in a different level of consciousness.

So , in the last 300 years , the process of schooling was to teach kids how to assimilate information , how to assimilate that from the outside , but all that data that it was put in the head of the people was from the outside and even from places where those kids could not relate.

So , a lot of that information was in books and they had no idea , no idea what it was for , because it was not related with their lives.

So , here starts another process of information , which is when people start to repeat data , to name us data.

So , they started to behave like machines.

## Q&A

So , the process , the system of teaching , the system of schooling , is a pyramidal structure that basically works with someone that knows and investigates on the top and gives that information to other people that make it more in pieces , then they teach it to the teachers , to the masters , and then it goes to the kids that school. The kids are not allowed to make questions. They are just there to receive the information from the one on the top.

So , by this system , during 300 years , the population of our civilizations were used to have only one source of truth. The scientists , the teacher , the media , the communication , media , the politician , the master , whatever. They are their top of the hill and that 's the only one that you can trust. We have to understand this.

We have to go to the origin of how the things are happening.

Now , we would say , well , the system is horrible , but it 's not horrible. For that time , that was the only tool. It was the best way. There was no other tool to rich the information.

So , books were the only ones and those people , the teachers , the masters , everyone , with knowledge , were the only ones able to give that information to others.

So , it was perfect for that moment. It was the most useful system for people to reach the knowledge. This worked until the moment when the pyramid did this and we called that internet.

So , in the last 50 years , we happened with the internet. You already know what 's internet , the internet means between and network.

So , between networks. This means that suddenly , you should not go or you do n't have to go to the library or to the school to receive information.

Now , everyone from everywhere can go and look for the information , but also , you can upload information. This is something really new.

So , now , picture this that , within the last 50 years , has changed the last 300 years , the last 300 years changed the 300 and 1000 years , and in the last 5 years , we changed the past 50 years. It 's been so fast.

So , in the past 5 years , internet stopped being a place where you uploading information to inform yourself , so to shape yourself , to grow. And in the last 5 years , what people start to do is just upload information. But without the process of informing information , you know what I mean? Just data.

In the last period of time , there was maybe 1000 people that uploaded information to the network for around 7 billion people in the world. But now 7 billion people in the world are uploading information for 8 billion people in the world.

So , it creates distortion because what we all are uploading , basically , is perceptions , ideas , prejudgments of information , but not the truth , not only one information. We upload so much information , and most of it are just perceptions of our reality , but not reality itself. And in the internet , it becomes data information itself.

So , this is why we create confusion because information stops being information , real information , and just starts to be point of views , then we believe they are true.

So , by this , I 'm not saying that people are uploading lies , but we are so many people , thousands and billions of people , then we are uploading our own truth , then we have the possibility to create our own truth , to share our own truth. That suddenly , we have so many truth that we do n't know why it 's alive.

So , this is why we are living in the most over-informated , over-informated times. And this is why we have a lack of information.

So , basically , one of the things that happened with this is that so much confusion creates confusion within. And this makes us feel we can not trust anything outside.

So , this takes us to this idea that if everything that is outside , I can not trust because everything can be alive.

So , what the only way I can find the truth is going within , inside. I do n't know if you have noticed this , but as beer is the confusion in the outer world , with all the chaos of information , most of the people start to awake to the inner self. Most of the people are trying to wander about the inner truth , for sure you have noticed this in the world. And basically , this is happening because we have so much confusion in the outer world that we have to look for the inner world.

So , this conflicts that we are living with the confusion that we have in our societies today , is being used by the system of light , by the system of consciousness , to bring evolution. We have this need of believing because we are looking for the information into the outside. But imagine that even myself , what I am explained right now , and I have been explained all the time here , it 's just my perception , it 's just my point of view.

So , you do n't have to believe what I am saying because it 's not the truth , what I am saying is not the truth , what I am saying is just my point of view of my memories of everything that I have within that I am sharing here. But it 's not the truth.

So , this spirit , the higher self , you used to say , if it 's not practical for your life , then it does not work. It 's not useful. If it 's not useful , it 's not practical.

So , you do n't need it. It 's just confusion.

So , imagine that tomorrow I decide to say to all of you that everything that I have been saying to you about my past lives , but my other dimension , realities and memories , all of that is a lie. Everything is a lie. I am painted , I fake it , it 's all an invention. Imagine if I do that.

What would happen? What would happen? What would happen with all the things that were useful for you? You will also take them away.

So , this is the thing. Are all the things that I am given to you useful for your life? Maybe some of the things , maybe some not?

So , if it 's useful , you take it. It does n't matter if it 's a lie. If it 's useful for your life , and it helps you to make good.

So , there 's no problem with the perception.

So , the best example that we will have is for some people reads , I do n't know , as a book of Jill 's version.

Some people watch some movie of Margaret De , I do n't know , so you see these super heroes or these stories , amazing stories. And a lot of people , they find it potential because of those stories. And all those stories are a lie. It does n't exist.

It 's just a story. It 's just a perception invented by someone that wrote everything. But even though , a lot of people get inspired by that and they do good things. They create things because of stories.

So , is that illusion something wrong? Is that confusion something wrong? No.

So , you ca n't take from all the things that you can see or you can perceive as a lie. You can take good things from that. Basically , what we have to do is not to look for the truth. A lot of people is looking , what is the truth?

Where is the real truth? And the truth is that there is no absolute truth. Basically , you can not believe anything. It 's impossible.

Now you have so much information that you will loss a lot of time trying to figure out what is the real truth.

So , the only way how you will recognize a truth is by its practical. If it is practical and coherent and harmonious with environment , that 's good. It 's practical. This is the new time.

The new time would be about what is useful , what is practical. Because now , in the times of confusion , we will loss a lot of time trying to figure what is true and what is not.

So , the new spirituality in Aquarium times is about what is practical. That would be. They put the music again.

## Daily Practice Elements

So , let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is new. The statement for today is I am the expansion of matrix. The code for today is love.

The last universe of love is about love. Whose meaning is eternity. This means that the known of the other loss has an end. That one is the being and that known of the beings that lives through them will be left behind.

Nor will be running ahead of them. For all the processes are accepted with the same and conditionality. For this reason , we say that God , the universe is love. For all the loss originate from it.

They are not external mandates , but free tools that if we love and we learn to use , we will create our own universe. Can you hear our music now? Not the music from outside. See it comfortable?

We begin to move our shoulders and circles so we relax. Then back.

So , we start to let all the weight of our body to fall down , relaxing , closing our eyes and just focusing in our breathing. To take a deep breath , feeling the light around you. And how it goes deep through your skin , to your bones , muscles and organs. I feel , I perceive.

## Energy Work

The light is inside of me and the light outside of me. As I become the light itself , I am , I am , my higher self. The light that goes within my body through the crown , through eye , curl , heart , flees , scrum , root , grease , and ankles. Within my body , I say to myself that I decide , that by the sire , to turn the scent like confusion , to keep going with my process of information.

Take a deep breath and get out from your feet , going through the crust of the planet. The rocks , roots , filling the pressure and the heat of the magnet. As you go fast , turn deeper to the core of iron and planet earth. I recognize in the core of the world the questions that creates my life.

Who? Why? What for? Where?

## Q&A

Who? When? All these questions I made to myself. Without expecting any answer , I just recognized them as the tools from the confusion to find the information.

I feel the pressure of all the questions of my existence and I calibrated them with my vibration. I am the expansion of the matrix. I am the expansion of the matrix. I am the expansion of the matrix.

I am the expansion of the matrix. You are clear to me. You leave the trap in me. Until the day you become me.

I know what 's in it. I know what 's in it. I am the next of consciousness. You will be trapped in my web.

You will be as much strength as you make to escape from me. For you to not escape of what you are. I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness.

Become me. I will be free. I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness.

I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness.

I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness. I am the next of consciousness.

Everything that exists in the universe is linked to connections between things. Electrical connected resource.
