# Day 96 - Information: The Process of Taking Form

## Daily Practice Elements

**Vibration**: NEW  
**Statement**: "I am the expansion of matrix"  
**Chakra**: Solar Plexus Chakra  
**Law**: Law of Love - The last universe of love is about whose meaning is eternity. This means that none of the other laws has an end. That one is the being, and that none of the beings that lives through them will be left behind, nor will be running ahead of them. For all the processes are accepted with the same unconditionality. For this reason, we say that God, the universe is love. For all the laws originate from it. They are not external mandates, but free tools that if we love and we learn to use, we will create our own universe.

## Overview

Information is not data from the outside—it is a process. The word "information" comes from the Latin "in-formation," meaning to be in the process of taking form, of shaping yourself. From the very beginning of humanity, the concept of having information was not to catch things from the outside but to walk the path of experience, to gain wisdom by living, to get in shape as you form yourself in life through constant evolution. This process of information is driven by three basic needs that push us through evolution: hunger (the need to eat), safety (the need to be safe), and shelter (the need to sleep). All civilizations and cultures developed from these three basics, and when we fulfill them, we achieve what we call happiness—the goal of feeling plenty, comfortable, satisfied.

In the last 300 years, the Industrial Revolution gave humanity education for the first time through schools. This shifted information from experiential learning to mental feeding—giving kids data from the outside, often unrelated to their lives. The system created a pyramidal structure where knowledge flows from the top (scientists, teachers, media) to the bottom (students), who were not allowed to question but only to receive. This worked for that time because books and teachers were the only tools to access knowledge. But then came the internet—"inter-network," between networks—which changed everything. Suddenly, everyone could access and upload information. In the last five years, this exploded: seven billion people uploading their perceptions, not just truth, creating massive confusion because we have so many truths that we don't know what is real anymore.

This chaos is actually being used by the system of consciousness to bring evolution. The confusion in the outer world forces us to look within for truth. The answer is not to search for the absolute truth in the chaos of data but to focus on what is practical and useful for your life. If information is practical, coherent, and harmonious with your environment, then it's good—it's useful. This is the new spirituality of Aquarius: what is practical, what works, not what is absolutely true. We are trapped in the network, the matrix, until we become it—until we recognize we are the network itself, not separate from it. You are the weaver, the expansion of the matrix, creating consciousness through connections.

## Core Teaching

### The True Meaning of Information

Information comes from the Latin "in-formation," meaning to be in the process of taking form. It describes the process of getting informed, of taking shape, of forming something. When you absorb data from the outside, information is not that data itself—information is the process of understanding that data, of shaping it, of forming it within yourself. From the very beginning of humans, the concept of having information was never about catching things from outside but about walking the path of experience to gain wisdom by living life. As you evolve, you get in shape, you form yourself—that is information. This process is not born from magical or divine ideas of finding yourself; it starts from needs. We have three basic needs that push evolution: hunger (to eat), safety (to be safe), and shelter (to sleep). All civilizations, religions, societies, and cultures developed from these three basis.

### The Three Needs and Happiness

For the last 300,000 years of *Homo sapiens sapiens* existence, humans have been designing cultures, religions, societies, and civilizations from only three basic needs: to eat, to sleep, and to feel safe. From these three, we created one goal: to feel plenty in all of them. If we accomplish this goal of commodity—fulfilling food, shelter, and safety—we call it happiness. So happiness is the concept that makes you recognize you have accomplished these three needs. This is why the pursuit of happiness is basically to fulfill these three main needs. Religion, politics, and society all try to cover these three needs so you feel the comfort of happiness. If religion gives you these three things, you will have faith in that religion because it gives you happiness. If a politician provides these three, you will trust that politician. By controlling these three needs—food, shelter, and safety—any system can control you. This is why systems say, "I will make you happy." If you feel happy with them, it's all perfect.

### The Path of Education and the Pyramidal System

One important thing to know: the pursuit of happiness is the path of ignorance, because whoever looks for happiness in life is just seeking these three needs without evolution. But we are humans with bodies, and we need to eat, sleep, and feel safe—so it's normal, it's not bad. We are here trying to survive in this reality. The thing is, if you are not evolving, if you don't realize you need to change how you eat, sleep, and take care of yourself, these three needs will keep you constantly stuck in the past, trying to survive each moment without information, without being informed, without forming yourself. You are just focused on three main needs without growth.

In the last 300 years, thanks to the Industrial Revolution, we had education for the first time. We created schools. In this period, the system took all the kids who were used to living for eating, sleeping, and being safe, and put them into schools to feed them with data—mental information. They said, "Now we need to feed you with data so you feel comfortable with what you know, so you feel safe taking decisions." Basically, it's the same three needs but at a different level of consciousness. The process of schooling was to teach kids how to assimilate information from the outside, but all that data was from places those kids could not relate to—in books, with no idea what it was for because it wasn't related to their lives. Here starts another process of "information," where people start to repeat data like machines.

### The Pyramidal Structure and Its Limitations

The system of teaching, the system of schooling, is a pyramidal structure that works with someone who knows and investigates at the top and gives that information to other people who break it into pieces, then teach it to teachers, masters, and then it goes to kids at school. Kids are not allowed to make questions; they are just there to receive information from the one on top. During 300 years, the population was used to having only one source of truth: the scientists, the teacher, the media, the politician, the master. They are at the top of the hill, and that's the only one you can trust. We have to understand this was not horrible—for that time, it was the only tool, the best way. There was no other way to reach information. Books were the only ones, and those people with knowledge were the only ones able to give that information to others. It was perfect for that moment, the most useful system for people to reach knowledge.

### The Internet Revolution and the Chaos of Information

This worked until the moment when the pyramid did this (flipped) and we called that the internet. In the last 50 years, internet happened. Inter-net means "between" and "network"—between networks. Suddenly, you should not go to the library or school to receive information. Everyone from everywhere can go and look for information, but also, you can upload information. This is something really new. Picture this: within the last 50 years, we changed the last 300 years; the last 300 years changed the 300,000 years; and in the last 5 years, we changed the past 50 years. It's been so fast.

In the past five years, the internet stopped being a place where you upload information to inform yourself, to shape yourself, to grow. In the last five years, people just upload information without the process of in-forming—just data. In the last period, maybe 1,000 people uploaded information for 7 billion people in the world. But now 7 billion people are uploading information for 8 billion people. This creates distortion because what we all are uploading is perceptions, ideas, prejudgments of information, but not the truth, not only one information. We upload so much information, and most of it are just perceptions of our reality, not reality itself. In the internet, it becomes data, information itself. This is why we create confusion—because information stops being real information and just starts to be points of view that we believe are true.

### The Practical Truth

By this, I'm not saying people are uploading lies, but we are so many people—thousands, billions—that we are uploading our own truth. We have the possibility to create our own truth, to share our own truth. Suddenly we have so many truths that we don't know what is real. This is why we are living in the most over-information times, and this is why we have a lack of information. So much confusion creates confusion within, and this makes us feel we cannot trust anything outside. This takes us to the idea that if everything outside cannot be trusted because everything can be a lie, the only way I can find truth is going within, inside.

Have you noticed this? As there is confusion in the outer world with all the chaos of information, most people start to awake to the inner self. Most people are trying to wonder about the inner truth. This is happening because we have so much confusion in the outer world that we have to look for the inner world. This conflict with confusion in our societies today is being used by the system of light, by the system of consciousness, to bring evolution.

We have this need of believing because we are looking for information in the outside. But imagine that even myself, what I am explaining right now and all the time here, it's just my perception, just my point of view. You don't have to believe what I am saying because it's not the truth—what I'm saying is not the truth. It's just my point of view of my memories of everything I have within that I'm sharing. But it's not the truth. The higher self used to say: if it's not practical for your life, then it does not work, it's not useful. If it's not useful, it's not practical, so you don't need it—it's just confusion.

### The Example of Stories and Lies

Imagine that tomorrow I decide to say to all of you that everything I have been saying about my past lives, other dimensions, realities, memories—all of that is a lie. Everything is a lie. I am faking it, it's all an invention. Imagine if I do that. What would happen? What would happen with all the things that were useful for you? You will also take them away. So this is the thing: are all the things I am giving you useful for your life? Maybe some of them, maybe some not. If it's useful, you take it. It doesn't matter if it's a lie. If it's useful for your life and it helps you to do good, there's no problem with the perception.

The best example: some people read a book, watch a movie of superheroes or amazing stories. A lot of people find potential because of those stories. And all those stories are a lie—they don't exist, they're just a perception invented by someone who wrote everything. But even though, a lot of people get inspired by that and do good things, create things because of stories. So is that illusion something wrong? Is that confusion something wrong? No. You can take from all the things you can see or perceive as a lie—you can take good things from that.

### The New Spirituality: What Is Practical

Basically, what we have to do is not to look for the truth. A lot of people are looking: what is the truth? Where is the real truth? The truth is that there is no absolute truth. Basically, you cannot believe anything. It's impossible. Now you have so much information that you will lose a lot of time trying to figure out what is the real truth. So the only way you will recognize a truth is by if it's practical. If it is practical and coherent and harmonious with environment, that's good—it's practical. This is the new time. The new time would be about what is useful, what is practical. Because now, in the times of confusion, we will lose a lot of time trying to figure what is true and what is not. So the new spirituality in Aquarius times is about what is practical.

### The Matrix and the Weaver

The vibration for today reminds us that you are trapped in the network until you become the network. The weaver said: "You are trapped in me until you become me." Some people think we are trapped in the matrix, in the network, and we have to escape from it. But the reality of why they think we have to escape is because they are thinking of separate things, different from each other. They think the matrix is something outside controlling them, separating them from God or something above. But the real problem is the concept of separation—thinking there is something outside controlling me. From the point of view of the universe, everything is one. When we think there is something from the outside controlling us, it's because we are not thinking and living and acknowledging that everything is one. We are in duality.

The universe is only one thing in different perspectives, but it's just one thing. When the network, the weaver, said, "You have to become me in order to escape me," it explains that you cannot escape something that you are. The matrix is just one expression of the unity that you are. In order to become the unity, you have to become the network—that's the way in which you become the creator. This concept of matrix manipulating us, separating us from truth, doesn't have logic in a universe that is only one thing, that is unity. People who say "they are doing this, those are controlling us, this is separating us from something"—they are still living in duality. That's how you understand how duality works.

## Practice

The meditation today takes you to the core of the Earth to find the origin of all confusion and to recognize yourself as the matrix, the network, the weaver of consciousness.

**Preparation**: Sit comfortable. Move your shoulders in circles to relax tension. Focus on your breathing as you let the weight all fall down. Become aware of the light around you. Receive the photons going through your body to the core of it.

**Descent of the I Am**: Recognize yourself as light within and outside as one light only, for you are I Am. Take a deep breath and recognize: I am the higher self going down through my body, crossing through the crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacrum, root, knees, and ankles.

**Setting the Intention**: I set my intention: I desire to turn descent like confusion, to keep going with my process of information. I desire to understand the matrix, the network, the weaver.

**Journey to the Core**: Take a deep breath and get out from your feet, going through the crust of the planet, the rocks, roots. Feel the pressure and the heat of the magma as you go faster, turning deeper to the core of iron at planet Earth.

**Meeting the Questions**: Recognize in the core of the world the questions that create your life: Who? Why? What for? Where? When? All these questions you ask yourself. Without expecting any answer, just recognize them as the tools from confusion to find information. Feel the pressure of all the questions of your existence and calibrate them with your vibration.

**Vibration**: From the core, vibrate the sound **NEW** repeatedly.

**Statement**: Repeat: "I am the expansion of the matrix. I am the expansion of the matrix. I am the expansion of the matrix."

**The Weaver Speaks**: Listen to the voice of the matrix, the weaver of consciousness:

*"You will be trapped in me. You will be trapped in my web. You will have as much strength as you make to escape from me. For you to not escape of what you are. I am the network of consciousness. I am the network of consciousness. Become me, I will be free. I am the network of consciousness."*

**Return**: Recognize that everything that exists in the universe is linked to connections between things, electrically connected. Slowly bring your awareness back through the layers of Earth, rising through the magma, the crust, and back into your body. Take a deep breath. Open your eyes when ready.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Tonight before sleep, take five minutes to write down three pieces of "information" you received today—news, advice, opinions, facts. For each one, ask: "Is this practical for my life? Does it help me evolve, or does it just create confusion?" If it's not practical or useful, let it go. If it is practical, write down how you will apply it. This trains you to filter the chaos of data and focus only on true information—what actually helps you take form, shape yourself, and evolve.

### Applying the Wisdom

Throughout your day, when you encounter conflicting information or feel confused by the chaos of opinions online, pause and ask: "What is practical here? What actually works in my life?" Don't waste time trying to find the absolute truth in the noise. Instead, test ideas by their fruits: if something helps you be more coherent, harmonious, and aligned with your environment, it's useful information. If it only creates more confusion or separation, it's just data, not information. Remember, you are not separate from the network—you are the weaver creating consciousness through your connections.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What does "information" really mean?**  
A: Information comes from the Latin "in-formation," meaning to be in the process of taking form. It's not data from outside—it's the process of shaping yourself, of forming yourself through experience and evolution. From the beginning of humanity, information was gained by walking the path of life, not by absorbing external data. You take data from outside, and the process of understanding that data, of giving it shape within you, is information.

**Q: What are the three basic needs that drive human evolution?**  
A: Hunger (the need to eat), safety (the need to be safe), and shelter (the need to sleep). All civilizations, religions, societies, and cultures developed from these three basic needs. When we fulfill all three and feel plenty, we call it happiness. The pursuit of happiness is basically the pursuit of fulfilling these three needs.

**Q: Is the pursuit of happiness a bad thing?**  
A: No, it's not bad—it's normal because we are humans with bodies who need to eat, sleep, and feel safe to survive. But if you only pursue happiness without evolution, without changing how you approach these needs, you stay stuck in the past, just surviving each moment without growth. That's the path of ignorance. We need to fulfill these needs while also evolving, transforming, and forming ourselves.

**Q: How did education change the concept of information?**  
A: In the last 300 years, the Industrial Revolution created schools for the first time. This shifted information from experiential learning (living life) to mental feeding (giving kids data from outside, often unrelated to their lives). The system became a pyramid: knowledge at the top (scientists, teachers, media) flows down to students at the bottom, who are not allowed to question but only to receive. This worked for that time because books and teachers were the only access to knowledge.

**Q: How did the internet change everything?**  
A: The internet (inter-network, between networks) flipped the pyramid. Suddenly, everyone could access and upload information. In the last five years especially, billions of people started uploading their perceptions and points of view, not just truth. This created massive confusion because we have so many "truths" uploaded that we don't know what is real anymore. Information stopped being real information and became just perceptions that we believe are true.

**Q: How should we deal with all this confusion and chaos of information?**  
A: Don't waste time trying to find the absolute truth in the chaos. Instead, focus on what is practical, coherent, and harmonious with your environment. If something is useful for your life, helps you evolve, and allows you to do good, then it's valuable—even if it's technically a "lie" or just a story. The new spirituality of Aquarius is about what is practical and works, not what is absolutely true.

**Q: What does it mean that we are "trapped in the matrix"?**  
A: Many people think the matrix (the network) is something outside controlling us, and we need to escape it. But this is duality thinking. The truth is that you cannot escape the matrix because you are the matrix. The network is not separate from you. When the weaver says, "You are trapped in me until you become me," it means you must recognize you are not separate from the network. You are the weaver, the expansion of the matrix, creating consciousness through your connections. To become free, you must become the network, not escape it.

**Q: So if there's no absolute truth, can I believe anything?**  
A: The point is not that you can believe anything, but that you should test everything by whether it's practical and useful. Even the teachings here are just perceptions, points of view, not absolute truth. If something is practical for your life, coherent, and harmonious, use it. If it's not useful, it's just confusion. This way, you avoid wasting time searching for absolute truth in endless data and instead focus on what actually helps you evolve and take form—which is real information.
