## Overview

Welcome to Day 27, where we explore the root chakra through the genital glands—the organs of creation, vitality, and the physical anchoring of spirit in matter. This teaching addresses one of the most profound and revolutionary spiritual concepts: that enlightenment doesn't come from leaving the earth and the body, but from fully loving and inhabiting them.

Throughout spiritual history, there has been a persistent belief that in order to reach heaven, the spiritual dimensions, or enlightenment, we must leave behind the earth, the body, and especially sexuality. Matter and spirit have been seen as separate—even opposed—forces, with spirit being elevated and pure while matter (particularly "from the navel down") is seen as base, worldly, and something to be transcended.

Today's teaching shatters this false separation. The radical truth is: **heaven and earth are not separate. Matter is not different from heaven—matter is an expression of heaven.** Spirit doesn't come down into matter from somewhere else; spirit *becomes* matter. And the process of spirit becoming matter happens through the sexual, creative, vital life force that flows through the genital glands.

Far from being something to transcend or suppress, our sexuality and our body below the navel are the very foundation of spiritual awakening. The teaching reveals that the connection point between the spiritual mind and the physical body is between the pituitary gland (at the crown) and the genital glands (at the root). Enlightenment happens when this circuit is complete, when spirit is fully embodied, when we can feel the presence of divine consciousness in every cell of our body—which is the true meaning of orgasm.

## Core Teaching

### The Genital Glands: Location and Function

In males, the genital glands are the testicles (or testes), located in the scrotum outside the body. They produce sperm cells for reproduction and testosterone, the primary male sex hormone that governs libido, muscle mass, energy, and many other functions.

In females, the genital glands are the ovaries, located in the lower abdomen on either side of the uterus. They produce egg cells (ova) for reproduction and the primary female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, which govern the menstrual cycle, reproduction, bone health, mood, and many other functions.

These glands are associated with the root chakra, the energy center at the base of the spine related to survival, grounding, vitality, and the physical plane. While we often think of the root chakra as being about basic survival needs, it's also deeply connected to our sexual energy and our capacity to create new life—both literal children and creative projects, ideas, and expressions.

The genital glands are where the life force—the vital, creative, sexual energy—is most concentrated and accessible in the physical body. They are the source of our vitality, our creative power, and the physical mechanism through which spirit literally becomes matter through the conception of new life.

### The Historical Split: Earth vs. Heaven

Throughout much of spiritual and religious history, there has been a fundamental misunderstanding that has caused immeasurable suffering and distortion: the belief that earth and heaven are separate, and that in order to reach heaven (enlightenment, higher consciousness, spiritual reality), we must leave behind earth (matter, body, sexuality).

This belief led to the idea that everything "from the navel down"—the belly, the intestines, the genitals, sexuality, basic bodily functions—is somehow unspiritual, base, worldly, something to be ashamed of or transcended. The body became seen as a prison for the spirit, and the goal became escaping the body to reach some higher realm.

This created a spiritual bypassing where people tried to go up to the skies, to heaven, leaving earth and reality behind. They tried to leave their nature, their animal side, believing they had to become superior to nature in order to be spiritual.

The teaching is unequivocal: **This is a mistake.** This separation is false. This attempt to leave matter to reach spirit is fundamentally misguided.

### The Revolutionary Truth: Heaven and Earth Are One

The profound teaching of Day 27 is that **matter is not separate from or inferior to spirit. Matter is an expression of heaven. The earth is flying in heaven.**

We are not separate from heaven. Matter is not something different from heaven. Matter is simply heaven perceived from a particular perspective—like light passing through a broken mirror creates fractalized reflections, but it's still the same light.

The teaching uses the example from physics: if you look at the atomic structure of matter, atoms are 99.99% empty space. The example given is powerful: imagine a football field with a small rubber ball in the center (the proton) and a tiny particle spinning around the outside edge of the field (the electron). Everything in between is empty space. That's the reality of matter.

If you took all the actual physical matter of every human on Earth (all 8 billion people) and removed the empty space, it would fit in a space the size of a sugar cube. The rest is just magnetism, energy, space.

**Matter is just a perception.** It's not solid, separate, or different from spirit. It's a particular way that spirit/energy/consciousness appears.

This means: **To leave matter is also to leave heaven.** There is nowhere to go. There is no higher dimension to escape to. Dimensions are not places—they are perspectives on the same truth.

### The Spiritual Path: Balancing Matter, Not Leaving It

Given this understanding, the spiritual path is not about leaving earth to go to heaven. It's about recognizing that they were never separate and bringing them into conscious harmony and balance.

The teaching states clearly: "Our job is not leaving matter; it is to balance the matter, to set it again in balance, in harmony."

Matter is heaven that has been distorted—like light in a broken mirror showing fractalized images. Our work is not to run away from the distortion but to heal it, to harmonize it, to bring it back into balance.

The speaker (Matias de Stefano) makes a powerful commitment: "In my path, in our path we are sharing, you will never hear me say we are going to go to the fifth dimension, we are going to leave the earth, to enlighten ourselves. No. I will always say we are here to be responsible for those things that we have created, that we ourselves had distorted, that we ourselves must balance and harmonize again."

This is spiritual maturity and responsibility. Instead of trying to escape from the problems and distortions of matter, we take responsibility for them. We created these distortions (or at least participate in them), and we are here to heal them.

### Spirit Doesn't Come Down—It Becomes Matter

Another revolutionary aspect of this teaching is the understanding of how spirit relates to matter. The common image is that spirit exists in some higher realm, and then when a baby is being born, the spirit "comes down" from somewhere else and enters the body.

The teaching corrects this: **Spirit doesn't go down into matter. Spirit transforms itself into matter. Spirit becomes matter.**

Spirit is everywhere. It's not in a separate location. The spirit doesn't need to come from somewhere else—it needs to become, to transform into physical form.

The process of this becoming happens through energy, through what we call the soul, through the biological processes of hormones becoming sperm and egg, and ultimately through conception and birth.

This is not a separate process—spirit, soul, and body are not three different things. They are a continuous spectrum, one thing appearing in different forms.

And this is true not just for having babies. It's also true for activating your own spirit within yourself. "In order to connect to my spirit, it is not downloading the spirit; it is allowing the spirit to express through me."

Enlightenment is not about your spirit leaving your body to go somewhere higher. It's about spirit fully embodying, fully becoming matter, fully expressing through every cell of your physical form.

### The Connection: Pituitary and Genitals

The teaching identifies the crucial circuit for spiritual awakening: **the connection between the pituitary gland (at the crown, the seat of the spiritual mind) and the genital glands (at the root, the anchoring in matter).**

This is the pathway through which spirit becomes fully embodied. The pituitary, the master gland at the crown chakra, governs spiritual consciousness and higher mind. The genital glands, at the root chakra, anchor that consciousness in physical reality and vital life force.

When these two poles are connected—when energy flows freely between crown and root, between spiritual consciousness and physical embodiment—we experience the integration of spirit and matter. We are grounded and transcendent simultaneously. We are fully in our body and fully in consciousness.

This is why many spiritual traditions work with sexual energy and kundalini (the life force that rises from the root to the crown and back down again). It's not about the sex itself—it's about completing this circuit, allowing spirit to fully inhabit matter.

### Orgasm: Enlightenment in Matter

One of the most provocative and beautiful teachings in this lesson is the understanding of orgasm as a spiritual experience.

The teaching clarifies that it's not talking about "the orgasm that maybe we can describe in an easy way like 'let's do a quick' and then I go"—meaning quick, genital-focused, momentary sexual release.

Rather, it's about "the way that the spirit can feel itself in each one of the cells"—which is "activating the enlightenment of the spirit in matter."

True orgasm in this spiritual sense is not limited to the genitals. It's "the sensitive energy" felt "in each one of the cells of the body." If you don't feel this energy in every cell, even in your head, "you are not really activating this potential of the spirit."

This is orgasm as enlightenment: the full embodiment of spirit, the awakening of every cell, the experience of divine consciousness present in physical form. It's the dissolution of the false boundary between spirit and matter, the direct experience that they are one.

This is why working with sexual energy is so important spiritually—not for the sake of pleasure alone, but because sexuality gives us a tangible way to experience spirit in matter, to feel the life force moving through us, to know directly that we are not separate from the divine.

### Non-Attachment Through Love

The teaching addresses the concept of non-attachment, which is often misunderstood in spiritual circles to mean detachment or avoidance.

True non-attachment is explained this way: "When you accept the reality, it doesn't affect you anymore. You already know how it works, you know you can change it, you realize how it works, so you accept it, you love the reality. Because you don't need reality anymore, you don't need reality, you are free from reality. That's non-attachment."

Non-attachment is not leaving something or avoiding it. **Non-attachment is accepting and loving something so completely that you don't need anything from it anymore.**

"In order to reach heaven, we have to love the matter, love everything in the matter. When we love it, we don't expect anything from matter, we are non-attached."

This is radical: the path to freedom from matter is loving matter completely. The path to transcending the body is fully inhabiting and honoring the body. The path to enlightenment is falling in love with physical existence so completely that you're free within it.

The teaching concludes: "In order to transform our reality into light, we need to unconditionally love matter. The only thing that makes you free from something is that you don't expect anything from it. That's unconditional love."

### Releasing Sexual Trauma and Shame

The teaching acknowledges that most people have trauma, conflict, repression, and shame related to sexuality and the genital region. This is due to our society's conditioning, religious teaching, and collective misunderstanding about sexuality and the body.

These traumas and stuck emotions are precisely what block our spiritual energy, prevent the flow between crown and root, and keep us from experiencing enlightenment in matter.

"All these different traumas that we have related to the genitals are the main reason why we stuck these emotions and energy that we need for the meditations, for the alignments, for the planet, for to work with the planet."

The spiritual work requires releasing these blocks. This "implies to touch your own body, to enjoy your own body," to feel what you feel, to acknowledge the shames and locked emotions you have, and to consciously work with releasing them.

The teaching is clear that this is not about sex with another person or even specifically about tantra practices. It's about your own relationship with your own body, your own sexuality, your own life force.

"The first process, the first things that we need to understand before we go to the handling of spiritual energy in our body, is to release all the stuck energy that we have in our body."

## Practice

### Preparation

Find a private, safe space where you will not be disturbed. This practice involves deep work with your body and sexuality, so privacy and safety are essential.

Sit or lie comfortably. Take several deep breaths, allowing your body to relax completely.

Set a clear intention: to release trauma and shame related to sexuality and the body, to reconnect with your life force, to allow spirit to fully inhabit your matter, and to open the door of your temple.

### Main Practice: Opening the Doors of the Temple

**Step 1:** Begin with self-massage. Gently massage your body, starting with your head, moving to your shoulders, your chest, your belly. This is about recognizing your body as the temple that houses your spirit and soul.

**Step 2:** Bring your hands to your hips and massage by the sides of your hips. Move to your gluteus (buttocks), massaging gently. From the back, caress your spine, massage your spine, trying to reach your coccyx (tailbone).

**Step 3:** Come back to the front, putting gentle pressure on your hips. Massage below your belly button, down the sides to your thighs. Softly go down to the perineum (the area between the genitals and anus).

**Step 4:** From the perineum, slowly move up, recognizing the parts of your genitals. Without shame or judgment, acknowledge: "Here I can find the vital energy of my body." Caress from the genitals to the hips and back. This is about reclaiming your body, honoring it, feeling it.

**Step 5:** Relax your arms and take a deep breath. Now, without any judgment, picture in front of you the images of the traumas, conflicts, repressions, and shames you have related to these organs and to sexuality. Whether it's "I cannot use them" or "I use them a lot"—both realities come from the same conflict, the same wound. Observe the conflict in front of you with compassion, not judgment.

**Step 6:** Bring your attention to all the light that surrounds you—the emotional light (moon energy), the mental/spiritual light (sun energy), and the physical temple. Invite this light to come inside your temple.

**Step 7:** Take a deep breath and allow the energy and light of the emotional and mental to enter through the crown (cupola), through the eyes (windows), through the throat (bell tower), through the heart (sacristy), through the solar plexus (altar), down to the sacrum, reaching the door of your temple.

**Step 8:** Recognize: "This portal of my temple is the door through which comes the light and goes out the light." The genitals are the door at the root through which you see the light of the physical world, just as the crown is the door through which you see the light of the spiritual world. Both are the same light.

**Step 9:** Examine the door. Is it locked? Broken? Forced? Has it been violated? Acknowledge the state of your "door" (your relationship with your sexuality and root energy) without judgment. Realize: "It is only me, the one able to open them from within, to let my own light come out."

**Step 10:** Now make a conscious choice to activate the potential of the I Am in your genitals. Recognize: "I can open my doors. I can transcend the trauma. I can become life. I can feel. I can set me free."

**Step 11:** Begin to vibrate "So" (pronounced like "so" in English, or "saw"). Chant this sound several times, feeling it activate the light in your genitals. This vibration awakens the root chakra.

**Step 12:** Take a deep breath and push—energetically push to open your doors, letting all the light come outside, shining over your trauma, your conflict, your repression. Watch them dissolve, become light, disappear.

**Step 13:** Observe these traumas becoming nutrients for your light. They become water and minerals for your roots. The energy that was stuck in trauma is now freed and transformed into vitality.

**Step 14:** Feel the light go out through your genitals, through the doors, bringing all your inner light shining outside. This light brings vitality to yourself, shines into every dark corner around you, brings life force flowing.

**Step 15:** Recognize: "I use the same energy that was pushing me inside to open the doors, to push and express in the outside." The sexual energy, the creative life force—this is the power that opens your temple doors and lets your spirit shine through matter.

**Step 16:** Repeat aloud: "I Am the Path to Life. I Am the Path to Life. I Am the Path to Life."

**Step 17:** Place your fingers on your genital area (over clothing if you prefer, or directly on skin if you're comfortable) and affirm: "I ignite all the inner brightness. I Am the Path to Life. I am free. I can transform myself into vitality. I can use my sexual energy to create. I Am the Path to Life."

**Step 18:** Take your hands to your heart to calibrate. Bring consciousness from your heart down through all your body, integrating what has been opened and activated.

### Closing

Gently return to normal awareness. Stretch, yawn, move your body.

Open your eyes and take a moment to journal about your experience. What did you notice about your relationship with your sexuality and your body? What traumas or shames came up? What did it feel like to open the doors of your temple?

Throughout the day and the coming days, continue this work. The task given in the teaching is to find your G-spot—not necessarily the genital G-spot, but the energetic spot in your body where energy is concentrated, where tension is held, where when you touch and massage it, you can feel tension, pain, and then release that spreads through your whole body.

This spot might be anywhere—in your belly, your hips, your thighs, your back. It's the place where stuck sexual/creative/vital energy is concentrated. Finding it requires touching, caressing, and exploring parts of your own body you may have never consciously touched before.

This is sacred work. This is the work of embodying spirit, of loving matter, of becoming fully alive in your physical form.

## Integration

Throughout the day, practice awareness of your body, especially from the navel down. Notice any shame, discomfort, or disconnect you feel when you bring attention to your belly, genitals, or lower body. Recognize that these are conditioned responses based on the false separation of spirit and matter.

Practice touching your own body with reverence and love. This doesn't have to be sexual—it can be simply caressing your arms, your legs, your belly, recognizing your body as the temple of spirit.

Work consciously with releasing sexual shame and trauma. This may require therapy, somatic work, energy healing, or simply honest journaling and emotional processing. Be patient with yourself—these patterns often go very deep.

Examine your spiritual beliefs. Do you secretly (or overtly) believe that you need to transcend or leave your body to be spiritual? Do you think enlightenment means escaping earth for some higher dimension? Challenge these beliefs with today's teaching: enlightenment is spirit fully embodied, not spirit escaping from body.

Practice grounding. Since the teaching is about loving matter and being fully present in physical reality, spend time in nature, work with your hands, engage your senses fully, eat mindfully, move your body. These are spiritual practices because they anchor spirit in matter.

Work with the connection between your crown and your root. Meditate on energy flowing from the top of your head down through your entire body to your genitals and root, and then back up from your root through your entire body to your crown. This completes the circuit of spirit and matter.

Explore your creative and sexual energy. Remember that sexual energy is life force, creative energy. Even if you're not sexually active with a partner, you can work with this energy through self-pleasure, creative expression, movement, or simply conscious awareness of the vitality flowing through your lower body.

## Q&A

**Q: Is this teaching saying I should be sexually active to be spiritual?**

**A:** No. The teaching is about your relationship with your own sexual energy and life force, not necessarily about partnered sex. You can be celibate and still do this work—in fact, many spiritual traditions specifically work with sexual energy through celibacy, consciously choosing to transmute that energy for spiritual purposes. The key is not suppressing or being ashamed of sexual energy, but being conscious of it, honoring it, and either expressing it healthily or consciously choosing to redirect it. What blocks spirituality is shame, repression, and trauma around sexuality—not the choice to be sexually active or celibate.

**Q: I have significant sexual trauma. Is this practice safe for me?**

**A:** If you have significant sexual trauma, please work with a qualified therapist, particularly one trained in trauma-informed somatic work or sexual healing. This practice can be part of your healing journey, but it's best done with professional support. You can adapt the practice—for example, doing the visualization and affirmation work without the self-touch component until you feel safer. Always honor your boundaries and never force yourself into discomfort. Healing happens in small, safe steps, not through re-traumatizing yourself.

**Q: How is this different from tantra?**

**A:** The teaching specifically mentions that it's not talking about tantra, which is "like a doctrine" with specific techniques and practices for working with sexual energy in partnership. What's being taught here is more fundamental: the understanding that spirit and matter are one, that enlightenment happens through embodiment, and that your own relationship with your own body and sexuality is the foundation. Tantra can be a beautiful practice for those called to it, but this teaching is about the basic spiritual truth underlying all such practices: matter is sacred, sexuality is sacred, and we are here to love and inhabit our bodies, not escape from them.

**Q: What if I'm uncomfortable with the explicit nature of this teaching?**

**A:** Your discomfort is worth examining. Where does it come from? Is it because you were taught that sexuality and spirituality should be kept separate? Is it shame about your body? Is it trauma? The discomfort itself is often pointing to exactly what needs healing. That said, you don't have to force anything. Work at your own pace. Start with simply questioning the belief that spirituality requires avoiding sexuality. Start with honoring your body in non-sexual ways. The deeper work will unfold naturally as you're ready for it.

**Q: How do I know if I'm working with sexual energy in a healthy vs. compulsive way?**

**A:** Healthy sexual energy work feels empowering, integrating, and freeing. It connects you more deeply to yourself, your body, and your sense of vitality and creativity. Compulsive sexual behavior feels driven, out of control, shameful, and often leaves you feeling more disconnected afterward. Healthy sexuality increases your capacity for presence, intimacy, and conscious choice. Compulsive sexuality is often an attempt to escape from uncomfortable feelings or to meet needs that aren't actually sexual (like needs for connection, safety, or self-worth). If you're not sure which you're experiencing, working with a therapist can help you discern.

**Q: What's the connection between sexual energy and creativity?**

**A:** They're the same energy expressing in different ways. The sacral chakra governs both sexuality and creativity—both are about creation, generation, bringing new things into existence. Sexual energy is life force, the fundamental creative power of the universe. When you work with your sexual/creative energy consciously, you can channel it into any creative expression: art, music, writing, business creation, problem-solving, innovation. Many artists and creators report that periods of sexual activity or celibacy both can enhance creativity, depending on how conscious they are with the energy. The key is not suppressing it, but being aware of it and choosing how to express it.

**Q: Can I do this work while in a relationship? Will it affect my partnered sexuality?**

**A:** Yes, absolutely, and usually positively. When you heal your own relationship with your sexuality, release shame and trauma, and learn to be present with your life force, this generally enhances partnered sexuality rather than diminishing it. You become more present, more embodied, more conscious, more able to both give and receive. Your partner may notice that you're more comfortable in your body, more authentically expressive, more energized. That said, sometimes when one partner does deep healing work, it can temporarily create imbalance in the relationship as patterns shift. Communicate with your partner about the work you're doing.

**Q: What does it actually mean that "matter is 99.99% empty space"?**

**A:** From the perspective of quantum physics, atoms—the building blocks of all matter—are mostly empty space. The nucleus (protons and neutrons) is incredibly tiny, and the electrons orbit at a relatively huge distance from the nucleus. The teaching uses the football field analogy: if the nucleus were the size of a small ball in the center of a football field, the electrons would be spinning around the outer edge of the field, with nothing but empty space in between. This "empty space" is actually quantum field, energy, potential—not really empty, but not solid matter either. This is why the teaching says matter is a perception, not a solid reality separate from spirit/energy/consciousness. At the quantum level, there is no clear boundary between matter and energy—they're different expressions of the same fundamental reality.

*May you know deeply that heaven and earth are one, that matter is sacred, and that your body is the temple of spirit. May all shame and trauma around sexuality be healed. May your doors open from within, your light shine through matter, and your life force flow freely. I Am the Path to Life.*
