## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So , as you might see , I am a very huge need of being in silence and not in the state of explaining or guiding everything. But even though I am like this , I did n't want to just not appear today , and as I have been doing every day.

So , I just want to show up to say that I am here and also to thank all the messages that I was n't reading actually , but I know. I have been the whole day far from everyone and in silence , I am speaking with anyone.

So , not social media neither. The only thing to say is that I hope that the words that my heart has told me could be useful for you to the ones raising the blood.

Today is our day of the heart in the week of cancer.

So just to say for everyone that is following every day , I would recommend for you to go to the love to read the message for today and with that in mind , listen to the music in the blog and connect with the link with the point at the depth of it. Thank you for being here every day. Probably this day I will be in silence.

So , I will simply put the music here so it is recorded and you had it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
