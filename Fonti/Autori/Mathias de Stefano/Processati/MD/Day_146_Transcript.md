## Overview

On December 27th, we explore the continent of Oceania and its connection to the sacral chakra of the planet. Matias humorously notes that with only a few days left before 2020 ends, we're almost ready for "another global tragedy"—but he quickly clarifies this is a joke. In fact, he considers 2020 the best year for planetary consciousness, a perspective that reveals his Scorpio energy and deep sense of transformation.

Oceania is not the same as Australia. Australia is a country within the continent of Oceania, which includes many islands throughout the Pacific region. This continent represents the sacral chakra—the center of creativity, arts, power, and the ability to absorb nutrients to create energy.

The sacral chakra relates to the kidneys, the womb in women, and the ovaries—all organs of potential and creation. Today we explore how Oceania holds the energy of creation for the entire planet, centered in one of Earth's most sacred sites: Uluru.

## Core Teaching

### Understanding Oceania as a Continent

We usually call this continent Australia, but that's not accurate. Australia is a country within Oceania. Because Australia is such a large island country that makes up the majority of the landmass, we often mistakenly use the country name for the whole continent.

Oceania holds many islands around this area. This big island we call a continent, but it's not technically a continent—it's a very large island. When we say "continent," it means something that "contains" things—it holds many shapes and principles.

But Oceania doesn't hold many things in that sense. It has one great island (Australia) and a second, smaller island (Tasmania). Together, these form the country of Australia, which gets its name from Latin meaning "the land of the South"—the Austral land.

### The Geography of Oceania

The continent of Oceania starts in the Indian Ocean with the islands of Cocos Island and Christmas Island. From there, it extends to the whole island of Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.

Above Australia, we have Papua, which is divided into two parts: one half belongs to Indonesia, the other half is Papua New Guinea. From there, the continent continues to the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, and ends in Samoa.

All this territory with all these islands is the Oceanic continent. Other islands and countries within Oceania include Tonga, Niue, New Caledonia, and Norfolk Island.

The rest of the islands that I haven't mentioned are outside Oceania—they are in the Pacific Ocean but not part of the Oceanic continent itself.

### Oceania and the Sacral Chakra

This territory represents the sacral chakra of the planet. The sacral chakra is related to the kidneys, the womb for women, and the ovaries—all this region of potentiality.

Remember that this continent is related to creativity. The sacral chakra is about the arts, about power, about the absorption of nutrients to create energy and power. This is the representation of creation itself.

We are not talking about the Pacific Ocean in this territory. The limits of the continent are the countries I mentioned. The rest of the islands are outside in the Pacific Ocean.

### Why Oceania Represents Creation

This continent is called Oceania because it's surrounded by oceans, and most of it is actually under the ocean. All the islands that are connected to this continent are precisely that—islands surrounded by oceans and seas.

The only part of Oceania that is not in touch with the ocean or seas is the center of Australia, which is a very dry continent. It contains one of the biggest deserts in the world after the Sahara in Africa.

In the center of Australia, in the middle of this desert, we find Uluru. Uluru is the biggest rock, the biggest stone in the whole planet.

### Uluru: The Sacred Center

The center of this big island is also called by some people "Ayers Rock," but I wouldn't call it that to hold the real energy of this place. "Ayers Rock" is the name given by an explorer who saw it first in 1873. He called the rock on behalf of the Prime Minister of Australia at that time, whose surname was Ayers.

It's better to call it Uluru, which is the name that the native ones—the Aboriginal people from that territory—use. This is the right name, how they call it.

The axis of this ancient world relates to the natural rock world. Uluru is this big part in the center of the island of Australia, and it represents the axis of the ancient world.

Just beside it, you have another formation called Kata Tjuta, which is the temple to prepare yourself to go into the axis.

### The Ancient Population of Oceania

Let's see how this continent was populated thousands and thousands of years ago. First, remember that we humans came from Africa, went to the Middle East, from there to Asia, and from Asia we started to spread in three directions:
- To Europe
- To Australia through the region of Indonesia
- Above to Siberia, crossing to the Americas

Around 100,000 years ago, Asia and Australia were connected as one. There were only a few streams of water crossing from the Indian Ocean toward the Pacific Ocean between the islands of the southwest—Papua and Timor.

These three regions were the only ones through which water would flow, but the streams were so tiny that anyone from Asia could just use some woods and cross to the island in front.

At that time, Australia and Papua were only one—they were connected. So it was really easy for people to move between Australia and Asia.

### The Islands Were Once Connected

The islands of Papua were also connected to Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and the rest of the islands. They were so close to one another because the water in the oceans was very low due to the glaciations at that time.

The thing that changed everything was the explosion of the Toba volcano in Sumatra Island. This explosion happened 70,000 years ago and created basically the biggest change in our humanity.

This change of geography occurred because the explosion covered the whole world in ash for a long time. It created a bigger glaciation and activated the Chain of Fire—the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean.

That made all the volcanoes that were connecting the lands of Indonesia start to erupt, and it broke the whole region into different islands. This separated Asia from Australia.

### The Migration and Evolution After Toba

This great conflict created in Sumatra made humans migrate way south and east toward Australia and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. Others went up to Siberia and on to the Americas, all trying to get away from this mess that was created by Toba.

This made people adapt. Instead of just collecting fruits in the forest, they had to adapt to hunt animals, create tools, and find agriculture. This made humans begin to think. They needed to find new tools in order to survive.

This is why this volcano was basically the creation of the human—the homosapiens sapiens.

Because of this change of weather, Australia got separated from the islands of Indonesia. All the people from Indonesia kept going toward the islands—to Samoa, to Vanuatu, to Fiji, then to Tahiti, French Polynesia, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), and then to Chile and South America.

Way later in time, they also populated New Zealand, one of the latest places to be populated.

### Australia: Protected by Nature

These people, since 60,000 years ago, populated Australia, and no one touched them for thousands of years. They were there, all quiet, with no changes, nothing, because no one would arrive at the island. No one would touch the desert.

That's why they found that their power was not to sail the shores and seas through the islands, but to survive in the desert. For thousands of years, these people survived in the desert because nobody would come to Australia to invade—it was the most dangerous land.

Everything can kill you there. No one would touch the island because of crocodiles, the poisonous beings in the sea, the poisonous beings on the land. No one could cross the Outback. It was impossible for anyone to get to the center of this continent.

They were in a fortress, protected by nature.

### The Portal at Uluru

When these people arrived at Uluru, they saw its portal—two spirals coming down. The people from the Pleiades and Antares gave these Aboriginal people a task: to understand that everything has a logic, that the universe taught how the universe worked.

By doing that, they gave them a mission: "You have to hold the axis. You have to hold the portal of the ancient world so that when the new humanity needs to remember who they are, where they came from, and their origins, they can come back to you and you can teach them."

This is why the Aboriginal people have kept their traditions, their culture, and their way of understanding the world for over 60,000 years without changing. They were the guardians of the ancient knowledge.

### The Dreamtime and Creation Stories

The Aboriginal people developed the concept of Dreamtime—the understanding that all creation comes from the dream of the universe. The ancestors dreamed the world into being, and we continue to participate in that dreaming.

At Uluru, the serpent energy rises from the earth. This is the creative force, the kundalini of the continent, the power that breeds new life and new consciousness.

The sacral chakra is about creation, sexuality, creativity, and the power to bring new things into being. Oceania, isolated and protected, held this creative power pure and undisturbed for tens of thousands of years.

### The Modern Challenge

Today, one of the challenges we face is that this sacred center—this axis of the ancient world—has been disrespected and commercialized. Uluru has been climbed by tourists, treated as a curiosity rather than the sacred portal it truly is.

The Aboriginal people have asked for respect, for recognition of the sacredness of this place. To heal our sacral chakra as a planet, we must honor the keepers of this ancient wisdom and protect the creative center they have guarded for so long.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Connect with your own creative power today. Whether through art, writing, cooking, gardening, or any form of creation, recognize that you are a "celestial breeder"—someone who brings new things into being. Honor the creative process, knowing you are connected to the ancient axis of creation held at Uluru.

### Applying This Teaching

Reflect on what you are creating in your life. Are you creating from the dream, from the deep place of authentic power? Or are you creating from external pressure and expectation? The sacral chakra asks us to create from our true nature, just as the Aboriginal people have maintained their authentic culture for 60,000 years despite external pressures.

## Q&A

### Q: Why is Oceania called that if Australia is the main landmass?

Oceania is called that because it's surrounded by oceans, and most of it is actually under the ocean. All the islands that are connected to this continent are islands surrounded by oceans and seas. The name reflects the oceanic nature of this scattered continent.

### Q: What is the significance of Uluru being the "biggest stone" on the planet?

Uluru represents the axis of the ancient world. It's the sacred center where the portal connects the earth to the celestial realms. The Aboriginal people were given the task to hold this axis and guard the ancient knowledge so that when new humanity needs to remember its origins, they can teach us.

### Q: How did the Toba volcano create homosapiens sapiens?

The Toba volcano explosion 70,000 years ago covered the world in ash, created a bigger glaciation, and broke apart the connected lands of Asia and Australia. This forced humans to adapt, create tools, develop agriculture, and truly begin to think. Instead of just collecting fruits, they had to survive—and this created the "human that really is thinking."

### Q: Why were the Aboriginal people able to maintain their culture unchanged for 60,000 years?

Australia was protected by nature—a fortress surrounded by dangerous animals, poisonous beings, crocodiles, and the harsh Outback desert. No one could invade, so the Aboriginal people lived in isolation, holding the ancient knowledge pure and undisturbed. They were the guardians of the axis.

### Q: What is the relationship between Uluru and Kata Tjuta?

Uluru is the axis itself—the portal with two spirals coming down into the earth. Kata Tjuta, located beside Uluru, is the temple to prepare yourself before entering the axis. It's the preparation ground for accessing the sacred center.

### Q: What does "I Am the Celestial Breeder" mean?

It means you are a creator, someone who breeds new life, new ideas, new realities. The sacral chakra is the center of creation—not just physical reproduction, but all forms of bringing new things into being. You create from the celestial dream, from the ancient wisdom held in the axis of the world.

### Q: How does the sacral chakra relate to creativity and arts?

The sacral chakra is about the power of creation, the absorption of nutrients to create energy and power. It's where we transform what we receive into something new. This is the essence of creativity and art—taking in the world and birthing something that didn't exist before.

### Q: What is our responsibility to Uluru and the Aboriginal people today?

We must honor and respect the sacredness of Uluru and recognize the Aboriginal people as the keepers of ancient knowledge. They have held the axis for 60,000 years. To heal our planetary sacral chakra, we must stop treating sacred sites as tourist attractions and instead listen to the wisdom the guardians have protected for humanity.
