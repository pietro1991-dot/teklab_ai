## Overview

On December 31st, the last day of 2020, we celebrate the axis of the Earth and the completion of this extraordinary year. Matias wishes a happy 2021 to everyone already in the New Year (from India to the Pacific) and to all of us waiting for midnight.

This year, 2020, has been one of the most important years to connect everyone into thinking in a different way. Even though some people are still trying to live the same reality as before, most people have experienced a crisis that has pushed us to see everything differently, to think in different concepts, to awaken our consciousness.

This year has been like a master for everyone—a great opportunity to change our point of view and begin our inner growth. Since March, we've been doing alignments, going within, re-signifying all the concepts of our lives. It's been tough because learning means breaking concepts and breaking structures within ourselves. But this has been a really good year for transformation.

Today's topic is the axis—the central line, the imaginary line where the Earth is spinning. Everything that happens on Earth—tectonic plates moving, seas moving, changes, evolution—happens because of the axis of the Earth moving.

## Core Teaching

### What Is the Axis?

Axis is a Latin word that you may say "axle," which is the main part of a wheel that turns and makes the wheel turn. It would be that thing in the middle that allows the wheel to move.

In European languages, the word "ag" (the origin of axis) means **to move** or **to drive**. So driving would be the origin. That center of the hub—like a rod or a cane—is the hub where everything moves around.

**The axis is not about what is fixed in one spot. The axis is the symbolism of moving, of moving ahead.** It's related to movement, not to being still.

### Being "In Your Axis" or "Losing Your Axis"

We have sentences we use: "This person is in their axis," or "This person lost their axis." What does it mean to be in your axis or in line?

We usually think that a person who loses their axis is a person doing everything wrong, mistaking everything, lost, even crazy.

The idea of losing the axis would be like if you're driving a bicycle with two wheels, and suddenly when you lose your axis, the wheels start to wobble. There's no other option than to fall.

**To lose the axis is to lose the balance.**

This is something we've spoken about before. **To be in axis is related with the idea of being coherent with what you think, what you feel, and what you do.**

Imagine that we have a bicycle with three wheels aligned one with another. If one of those wheels loses the axis, the other two may fall too.

What we have to do is work on trying to be in that axis, to be coherent so we can move forward.

### The Axis Is the Essence

The way in which I will achieve to find the axis and the balance between these three wheels is through the **essence.**

**The axis is the essence.**

What is essence? Essence comes from the Latin word meaning "to be," an entity—the quality of a being. So it's an entity. **Essence means the ability or the quality to just be.**

Remember that we have spoken about this before. The essence basically means **to go back to who you are, to the reality of who you are.**

Remember that the axis is not something that holds you still in one place. **The axis is the one that helps you to find the power of yourself within, so you can use the energy around in order to build new things from yourself and transform the outside.**

It's about moving. **The axis basically is a key to transformation, not a key as a structure.**

### Learning from Mother Earth

We as humans living in this world have to learn from Mother Earth on how it transforms itself.

The reason why the Earth is transforming, changing, creating life constantly is because of the movement of its own axis.

The axis of the Earth creates:
- The tectonic plates moving
- The seas moving
- The continents drifting
- The climate changing
- Evolution happening

Everything that transforms on Earth is possible because the Earth spins on its axis. **The axis creates movement, and movement creates transformation.**

### The Calendar and the Axis

Of course, we all know that the Gregorian calendar is not the best calendar ever. But even though it's the calendar that we all share in the world, that's why it's in our subconscious altogether. So we take this moment.

Today, we believe this is the end of the year and the beginning of the new one. But really, for us, it's not the energy ending 2020 and beginning 2021. It's a symbolism, because the energy of 2020 really ends in July 2021.

So don't expect new things. We will be kind of in the same mood for the next months.

Remember that the end of a year, really, for us would be the Solstice and the Equinox. That would be the most important thing. We already had the December 21st Solstice—that was the beginning of the real new year. The Solstice (winter or summer, depending on hemisphere) would be the beginning of the year.

### The Roman Ten Days of Celebration

The reason why we take the 31st of December is because from the 21st of December, in Roman times, they celebrated 10 days of celebration for the end of the year. It was like the holidays for 10 days.

When the holidays ended, they celebrated the new year—on the 31st, today. This is the beginning. They would say, "Okay, the Solstice, and now we start to work again."

That's the God of two faces that they call **Janus.** Janus is the one that gives the name to January, the month. He is the God of two faces, saying "we begin the new time."

So in the calendars, they took this day to say, "Okay, this is the end of the year and the beginning of the new one." But really, it's in the Solstice.

Things of calendars, you know. History. And then it's actually the day we're in.

### The Axis and Coherence

To find your axis is to find coherence between:
1. **What you think** (mind)
2. **What you feel** (heart)
3. **What you do** (action)

When these three wheels are aligned on the same axis, you move forward smoothly. When one wheel wobbles off the axis, you fall.

The axis is not rigidity. It's not being stuck in one position. **The axis is the center point around which you can move freely, transform continuously, and evolve constantly—while remaining true to your essence.**

### The Eternal Celestial

The statement "I Am the Eternal Celestial" reveals the nature of the axis. The axis is eternal because it's the essence of being—it never changes even as everything around it transforms.

You are celestial because your essence comes from the cosmos, from the stars, from the infinite. You are eternal because your essence—the axis of your being—continues through all transformations.

The body ages. Circumstances change. Thoughts come and go. Feelings rise and fall. But the axis—the essence, the "I Am"—remains eternal and celestial.

### Transformation Through the Axis

We as humans must learn from Mother Earth. The Earth doesn't resist change. It doesn't try to stay the same. It spins on its axis, and this spinning creates:
- Tectonic movement
- Continental drift
- Climate cycles
- Seasons
- Evolution of life

**All transformation happens because of the axis moving.**

If the Earth stopped spinning, everything would stop. There would be no seasons, no weather patterns, no evolution. The axis creates life through movement.

Similarly, when we find our axis—our essence—we don't become rigid and unchanging. We become capable of true transformation. We spin around our essence, creating new realities, new versions of ourselves, new possibilities—all while remaining rooted in who we truly are.

### The Year 2020: A Master Teacher

2020 has pushed us to find our axis. It has stripped away everything that was not essential. It has forced us to go within, to question, to re-signify our lives.

Many people lost their axis this year—they fell, they struggled, they couldn't find balance. But this falling was necessary to discover: **What is the axis? What is the essence? What remains when everything else is taken away?**

This year taught us that the axis is not external structures, not jobs, not social status, not routines. The axis is internal—it's the essence of who we are.

When we find that internal axis, we can spin freely, transform continuously, and create new realities—no matter what's happening externally.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, as the year ends, reflect on 2020. What did this year teach you about your essence, your axis? What was stripped away, and what remained? Find three things that are part of your true axis—the unchanging essence of who you are. Then ask: Am I coherent? Do my thoughts, feelings, and actions align on this axis?

### Applying This Teaching

As you move into the new year, don't try to become someone new. Instead, find your axis—your essence—and spin around it. Let your axis be the coherence between your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Transform continuously, but always from your center, from your essence. This is how the Earth transforms: by spinning on its axis while remaining itself.

## Q&A

### Q: What does it mean to "lose your axis"?

To lose your axis means to lose coherence between what you think, what you feel, and what you do. It's like a bicycle with three wheels—when one wheel wobbles off the axis, you fall. When your thoughts, feelings, and actions are not aligned, you lose balance and cannot move forward smoothly.

### Q: How is the axis related to transformation?

The axis creates transformation through movement. The Earth transforms constantly—tectonic plates move, continents drift, life evolves—because the Earth spins on its axis. Similarly, when we find our axis (our essence), we can transform continuously while remaining true to ourselves. The axis is not rigidity—it's the center point around which all transformation happens.

### Q: Why is December 31st considered the New Year if the real change is at the Solstice?

In Roman times, they celebrated 10 days after the December 21st Solstice. When the holidays ended (on the 31st), they celebrated the new year. The God Janus (two faces) represents this transition, looking at the past and future. The Gregorian calendar uses this date, but energetically, the real new year began on December 21st. The energy of 2020 will continue until July 2021.

### Q: What is the essence, and how is it the same as the axis?

Essence comes from the Latin meaning "to be"—the quality of being, the reality of who you are. The axis is the essence because it's the unchanging center around which everything else moves and transforms. Your essence is not your thoughts, feelings, or circumstances—it's the eternal "I Am," the being-ness that remains constant even as everything changes.

### Q: How do I find my axis?

Find coherence between what you think, what you feel, and what you do. When these three are aligned, you've found your axis. Also, ask yourself: What remains when everything else is stripped away? What is unchanging in me? That's your essence, your axis. 2020 helped us find this by stripping away external structures and forcing us to discover what's truly essential.

### Q: What does "I Am the Eternal Celestial" mean?

You are eternal because your essence—the axis of your being—continues through all transformations. You are celestial because your essence comes from the cosmos, from the infinite. Your body ages, circumstances change, but the "I Am"—the essence—remains eternal and celestial. You are not defined by what changes; you are defined by what remains.

### Q: How can I learn from the Earth's axis?

The Earth doesn't resist change. It spins on its axis, and this creates transformation—seasons, evolution, life. Learn to find your center (your essence) and then allow yourself to move, change, and transform around that center. Don't try to stay the same. Like the Earth, use your axis as the power source for continuous transformation.

### Q: What is the significance of Janus, the two-faced god?

Janus looks simultaneously at the past and the future. This represents the transition from one year to the next, one era to the next. Standing on your axis means being able to honor the past while looking toward the future, without being stuck in either. You are the eternal present, the axis, around which past and future revolve.
