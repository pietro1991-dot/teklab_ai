## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning. Good afternoon , good evening.

So let 's begin today with our saku chara in the most awake of tourists. The topic for today is sculptor.

So as you see , we are in this path , we are trying to learn many different things. We have to open ourselves to see many things.

So in the spiritual path , it 's not only about talking about other dimensions , he 's trying to understand a little bit of everything.

So we have our mind very light open to understand the many possibilities of the creation.

So something that I wanted to say before we started today is regarding something that I wrote that I saw and that I would like to repeat everyone 's and a while.

So for us to be sure about what we are doing. This is a very long path. This is a very heavy path because it 's been every day for a year. And of course that we have been that we have been.

Every day connecting and every day doing things and learning stuff.

Sometimes when you do this kind of things , it maybe takes one week or when we can. Of worship , but this has been a constant path.

So every day we have been learning about tiny things like today 's culture. Another day maybe about something about biology and other day about the dimension.

So we have been touching all the different topics.

So we can have a wider conception of what is the reality. And we are doing this because we are here to change the world to change the planet. But not because we are willing to , but because the planet is changing.

So the planet is changing itself.

So that 's why we are here to make our part , which is to change. And when we do that , usually we want that change immediately. We want that to happen right now. And that takes us to a kind of a mistake that we do as the animals we are , which we are mammals.

And as mammals , we tend to put the responsibility in someone else , expecting that someone to make something for that change to happen. And that 's normal because of course we are mammals and we have been involved by that. Through that way.

So of course that because we are mammals , we are here doing the same thing. I 'm here. Explain stuff in front of you all the time you are listening.

So it 's kind of a mammal way of doing things. But it 's important for everyone to remember to know that the goal of this path is not to wait for me to do something for the others. This path is to know a little bit of everything.

So we ourselves can discover our own potential and what can we do for the world as an individual.

So it 's about learning , taking a bit of data and then to go farther and deeper into this concept by ourselves.

So this is not about waiting for someone to do something. This is a path to take you to do what you are supposed to do without expecting or waiting for anybody to do it before. And I 'm saying this because today I wrote , I read something that was kind of pushing to say , hey , like I 'm doing all this every day and sometimes we speak about topics that maybe are not related to what we are living or something like this. And someone can maybe think that I am just not doing anything or we are not doing anything for the change really.

And actually what I want to say is that this goal is to first know ourselves otherwise any change that we want to do it would be exactly the same and we 'll wait the same patterns. This is why before the tough that we are going to do to help in whatever we can in the future. First we have to know ourselves to understand the world , to know the universe and to awaken that I am within. And this is a huge amount of stories from the technology that today we live in , in other ways , as if it were a reality.

So we are going to talk about culture and how culture created humanity.

So as the topic for today which is culture and culture. Is one of the keys to understand the origin of humanity. It seems like weird to say , but actually it is. All our ancient stories says that we were made out of clay as a figure as a sculpture from the gods.

So this unified the idea of who has created us , it was nature , was aliens , was someone that worked with not. Who was the creator of humanity.

So this takes us to some conspiracy theories and things.

So culture can give us a lot of things to talk about.

So let 's talk a little bit of this about this. First. Let 's remember what sculpture means.

So sculpture comes from the inner png language scale , scale means to cut. To cut something and the word ure. You 're. The sculpture this part here means that something is done is the product of something.

So is the result of cutting something. Bueno. And those animals.

So basically sculpture is about cut things because the description of this is that you are taking the clay , you are taking the bricks , you are taking the stones and then you start to cut. To cut the pieces until you get the the shade , it can be any material that you have to cut to start to shave it.

So that would be the idea of the origin of sculpture.

So in order to understand the origin of. Salter sculptor. We have to go again to the origin of everything now or humanity.

So in the month of Sagittarius , I explained. A bit of how of why we are called humans humans comes from the Latin humans that means wet land.

So this is because we thought we were coming we were sons and daughters of water and earth.

So. And the tradition that we are the mud people. Is because. In a certain point thousands of years ago before we had a specific language before we have a culture basically.

And we were. Thousands of years ago when we were homicide. We used to. Cover ourselves with mud.

So we do n't smell so we do n't smell for the predators not to follow us and also for the insects not to bother us.

So we had this. Tradition or we used to cover ourselves in mud so we can survive and we can walk secure through our. Our path. This created the concept that we came from the mud that we are the people from mud.

This creates the idea that humans were created by mud. We come from mud and we survived. And we 're the sign by mud.

So. Because we were living in mud. A typical thing that every kid on young person would do is to take the mud and play with it. And then playing they would create these little figures.

They would create these little figures to imitate the people that we were there. The family and so on.

So they create this tiny little statues of mud that they saw that with the sun with the heat they would start to get dry and hard as a rock.

So what we started to do. Was to. To get better into this cultures until we shaped humans. And this.

This humans mainly were women. Fatty women.

So they were pregnant or they represented fertility. They represented. Abundance. They had a meaning of.

Yeah , a good of good things to come.

So once we. Once we managed to do this play figures. We started to put names on them. And by putting them a name was like creating a new human.

And you. Part of the family.

So that created idea of. And a great or a being that was protecting the family. That has a soul. He was the mother earth.

So from this. Figures they started to make animals. They started to make different creatures creating from imagination. And they started to originate the concept of the two first main religions.

We were that were the. Animistic religions and the polemic religions. Those who follow the. The animals.

So this animals in that shape of a clay. They would be the protectors of the family or the group.

So sculpture. Abel people to download imagination into matter. They started to create. Beans that does n't exist.

They started to design creatures. That were in there. And even though. They could manifest it.

So for example , the dragons dragons. Beans that they did n't exist. But they were able to. Manifest them by sculptures.

So by imagination and this culture. They helped the beings that were invisible in imagination and beyond. To be downloaded into the matter.

So when they added the eyes to the sculpture. They felt like the soul or the spirit of those beings were reincarnated in that. And then figure. These traditions of.

Shaping something in order for the. The. The. The matter.

Was spread into many cultures into many civilizations. Like for example. Here I am in Egypt and in Egypt. You have many of different kinds.

So what they did was to write and shape the images of their gods. God is as and. And divinity is. And by shaping them in the walls.

What they accomplished or they were willing to. Was to call the attention of the gods.

So they could come see straight into their eyes and to go into the matter.

So that 's why the writings and the signs where consider. Holy.

So holy scripture scripture. Holy scripture in Greek. You might say.

So.

So.

So through time. The. The work with not started to be also work with play from play to. From play to.

To stones from stone to granite and it 's and it became harder and also. Much more perfect. And the idea of doing this culture. As you see was not just to do something beautiful and say.

Oh look how beautiful I did this. No , the goal was totally different. The goal was to be. To help the divinity that is invisible.

To have a place to manifest itself.

So the spirits can come to the stone and speak to the humans and we could speak with them through the stones.

So it has a specific goal to manifest the divinity.

So as you see. The culture it was not just a kind of art as we have today. Culture was something young. Was a way that.

Able 's the divinity to live in between humans and its own creation. It was a way to communicate it to communicate with the divine.

So eventually. There comes a moment in history. When humans or start to wonder. If the spirits of the divine.

They. If the spirits of the divine. They are eternal and they can incarnate in the stones to give a life forever.

So some humans said I want to do the same.

So some priests , some. Kings and queens. Farms. They started to.

They started to design. Salter for themselves. They started to say I want to be eternal too.

So I want my own statue. Not only did statues of their their gods the divinities. But they started to make statues for their important people.

So they could keep. Alive forever. And. Of course that if you are going to live forever.

You want to. To look as perfect because. You 're not going to be ugly forever. For example , so they tried to design themselves as the best they could.

To be eternally like that. And for example , here in Egypt you have if you come to Egypt and you see. You will see. Runs is the second.

You go you see every such here and it 's like , wow , he was beautiful. He was strong. Wow. He was not like this.

The guy was like 70 years old and he did all these statues of himself. Looking like 20 , 25 years old. Strong man. Beautiful.

Powerful and so on. But of course , who wants to be like ugly and old forever.

So he wanted to be like that. Like I want to be eternally like this.

Okay.

So that 's why you see him like this in the statues. After this idea of having the images of gods and to be eternally this , it comes the bathing of civilization , which was the Greek Roman empires. And the Greek Roman sculpture was very different because in Greece they wanted to do something that was transcendental than the empires before , which was not too honoured eternity , but too honoured what they were living and how they were in that moment. Nature.

They were honoured in nature and how it was nature.

So that 's why all the cultures from Greece and Italy started to design this cultures to show the people and the gods in a very human way. The most natural way possible.

So they started to make this sculptures in a way that you can appreciate how beautiful they are. But something that maybe most of you do n't know is that in that period of time they wanted for them to be alive. And that 's why they were in white. They were colorful.

So much colorful.

So much colorful.

So many colors like this. It was every statue was like this in colors.

So now we see them white because of course the positive the time clean up for 2000 or 300 , 300,000 years. They went away.

So the stone is only there. The white stone. But in the Greek and Roman times all these cultures were painted with a lot of color. Very shiny.

They painted the face with red colors. If they had here with the hair was painted. They used to dress also some sculptures. They put a lot of colors.

A lot of shiny things in the body.

So it would be very grotesque to see that.

So if you 're able to see to picture how it was before it was like too much like too much color to weird and sometimes maybe horrible. But there was the thing of that day. Of course it would be until the Renaissance , the 15th century that the people that started to look back in history , they saw the sculptures white. And they thought that that was the way in which they were supposed to be.

So that 's why they started to do it white. And that 's why when you go to museums and you see the 15th century you will see this beautiful sculptures all in white and marble. But in the ancient times it was not ladies. It was all colorful.

So throughout all history as you see. The sculpture was a way to allow the spirits invisible to download into the matter to be living here in this reality.

So this is why sculpture. It was a way to understand that everything in the matter , everything that has a shape and name can be also related to the spiritual world. And that is the metaphysics that relates this culture with humanity. That people also believed that we were sculptures that we were also made like that.

And that the spirits that lives within us are living here because we are taking care of our bodies.

So if we Polish the body if we take care of the body. We carve perfectly the body.

So like if we are a sculpture. We are taking care of the spirit living here as long as as possible to be.

So this is the straight relationship in spirituality between sculpture and our reality.

So now is this relationship between body and sculpture. This spirituality between both of them that makes religion to decide the idea that if we are holding things with mud to put a soul on it.

So someone in the past had to do exactly the same with us. We came from the mud.

So we have been made out of mud. And if we were made out of mud , someone has to put a soul within ourselves as we do with our sculptures.

So we created the idea of the story that someone has used clay mud in order to create us.

So as you see , it 's not from before to the future that we created this story. It 's because it 's from in front to the back. We created the story according to what we were living. You get that.

So this take us to the oldest story of mud. Then was in the rich Middle East , the region of Middle East. That 's Middle East. That 's Middle East.

These are the rivers , Tigers and the authorities.

So now this region here is what we call Babylon and it 's between two rivers , Tigers and the authorities. In Greek , between two rivers is said Mesopotamia. Mesa is in the middle and Potomac is rivers.

So in between rivers. Mesopotamia. This here is the desert of Syria. This here is the desert of Sinai.

All this here is the desert of Persia , actual Iran. All this region here , carcasses and the north of Turkey was ice. Ice Age.

So this region here belong to other people , other cultures that were warriors and nomads.

So as you see here , what we have in this territory is the people , the garden. It 's a territory that is impossible to expand because everything is desert.

So the garden.

So this territory here was called as the territory of the light. The territory of light was Uru and today is called the same but with a mispronunciation Iraq. And this is what we call the Eden Garden.

So in this territory here is where this civilization was born , Babylon.

So in this religion they said that the sky and the heaven , the sky and the earth created the divinity of nature that they were , they had to design the , they had to design humans. The God of skies they call it Anu and the goddess of the earth was called Ki. The kids , the children of Anu and Ki were called the Na.

So the children of Anu and Ki were called the Anu Na Ki. Anu Na Ki. The children of heaven and earth.

So it 's important to know this because everyone here for sure have heard this name Anu Na Ki. And for sure it 's related to aliens and related to people that is wrong , that is bad and the name is like the dead. But actually if we go to the mythology of the old language , it 's just to say we are sons of the heaven and earth. And what are we?

Are we sons of heaven or children of heaven or earth?

So we are Anu Na Ki too , it 's just about language.

So then from then we have two kids , many kids , but mostly two. One is the Lord of the earth and the other one is the Lord of the Wind. And is the name for Lord.

So the Lord of earth , what 's its name? N Ki. The Lord of earth. N Ki.

And the Lord of earth of the Wind and the Wind. What are these two? Are the representations of agriculture? Because N Ki is the Lord of the Web Lang and Neil , the Lord of the Wind of the Stories.

So N Ki and Neil. N Ki is the Lord of these two rivers , the Web Lang. That 's it. And Neil , the Wind of the Stories , is the Wind that comes from Anatolia , the mountains that comes down.

And they go down.

So in between the two rivers and the winds that come down the mountains to the valley , you have agriculture. The perfect place to generate a civilization. And because N Ki is the Lord of the Web Lang is the creator of humans.

So , important to understand , these names here are names from this territory. But this story is been set in many other places around the world. In every continent , in Asia and the Americas and Africa , in Europe , in Australia , everywhere. They have the same things.

Wetland , wind , sky , air , concepts. How do you say red land in these languages? Adam. How do you say life in this language?

Wah from the red land comes the life. As you see , they are all concepts. But in order for the dignity of that concept to incarnate and to be able to talk to , we personificate , we put the body of a person to that concept.

Okay? And that how it becomes a God.

So , what am I saying here? That there were not aliens in history that were in touch with humans? No , I 'm not saying that. Of course , there were aliens.

Of course. But they were in those gods. This is another story.

So I say this because when we , as I said , we started to , we stopped believing in the Bible and suddenly we are , we are believing in other Bible from other cultures , even older.

So we are having this conflict today that we stopped believing in the stories of the Bible and we can tell now that the history of this religions come from the sources and eggwinoxys and so on. But I do n't know why we keep believing the stories of literally we keep believing in the stories that are older.

So we have to rethink about that. The answers are not so farther from us.

So when someone from the outside came to this era to do stuff , they were not in touch with humans as we believe in the histories in the stories. But we started to mix both stories as if the two characters are the same one. And we started to believe that they are the same.

So as I explained here , sometimes we just stay with one thing saying that this is truth or this is not. And it 's not like that , not always like this or like that. We have a bit of everything. But we have to remember that we are humans.

We work in this planet. We come from this planet. We are animals from this world. We work.

And there came other beings from other planets that transform NA in some species like ours in this world of course. But this story , I mean in this stories , we have to check this stories and to see this stories. That sometimes we miss parts of it because we just take the story that we have heard. But behind there is geography context and many things that can help us to understand that we are mixing stories and things.

I hope that we can get this concept of culture today. That in the same way as we design things. Figures to put a spirit on it. We created the idea that someone has to build ourselves through the same materials to put a soul as spirit within us.

So that 's why I want to for us to get here as important in this culture.

So here the clue of history is where there are aliens that came to Earth and modify us. Yes , they did experiment with us. Yes , where they did gods and goddesses that stories tell about no. The stories , the mythology is other thing that describes our environment and the stories of aliens were put inside of those other stories.

It was eaten by our own place.

Okay? And something to clarify here because I see that many times. Humans do n't come from monkeys. Monkeys are minutes.

Monkeys are minutes. Different species. Darwin never said that we came from the monkey.

Okay?

So just to clarify this because sometimes we take that information from some places and we start to not to look for by ourselves. And Darwin never said that we come from the monkey. We come from the homicide. He did n't have the whole picture , the whole thing.

And that does n't mean that it 's wrong. It does n't mean that it 's wrong. Darwin put another link into the understanding of evolution.

So now we get to understand evolution because of what he did. But this does n't mean that he was wrong.

Okay? And he never said we come from the monkey.

So important to understand this , okay? Because we sometimes keep something that someone said and we take it as true. And we have to look for it.

So the same thing happened with this story of creation.

So another thing that sometimes I see a lot too that humanity was that they like to us. That people like to us to humanity. And nobody like humanity. What happened in history is that a lot of people were saying something and people listen something different.

And others believed in something different. And they had experience and some others did n't have experience.

So it 's important to understand that throughout the history , some people believed those stories.

So we were not full by anyone. We just kept going with information that was mistaken because we did n't get it.

So important to understand that we are all the time molding the information that the conflict here is not that someone lied to us is that we are not looking for a new answer. Imagine that you listen all of what I say and you just take it as the whole truth and you do n't keep looking for it. Eventually this will become lie. Eventually if you do n't look for it and maybe someday you find a new answer and what that means that I was wrong.

It does n't mean that I was wrong. It means that I give you something for you to keep looking for it. There 's no complete truth.

So , Important to understand this because nobody lied to us. It 's just that we stop looking for it.

So , I invite you to remember that with all this what we have to do is to script ourselves. To save some things that we do n't need to add some new things to mold ourselves in this culture in body , soul and spirit. And as Michelangelo said to discover the angel that is inside the stone , the essence that is within this structure. The variation for today is re.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am guardian of the web. The goal for today of course had to be alien. Everything that is found outside or is unknown for our world is considered alien. This means that does n't belong to the terrestrial kingdom and for that they constitute the alien kingdom.

Here it can be considered all those beings that overcome humans that have accomplished living in the development of the fourth dimension that allows to abandon the biological cells of their worms to go through time in those biological and planetary evolution. I become aware of the space that surrounds me. The body ai n't habit. And my own breathing.

I start to use my imagination to make every object in this room disappear. Everything disappears. Bunch. Even the roof.

The walls. The floor. All of it. Becoming void.

Myself. In this void. I bear tension to a one specific spot. And I bring all my energy and intention to that spot.

I focus all my being in this thought. I lose strength in this part. It becomes a spark. And this part.

Start expanding to many others that create a fire. A fire that grows bigger and bigger. Lighting the whole space. Till I can feel the heat in my skin.

I recognize that this fire is the essence of my soul. And from this fire. I can build my own. I recognize that this fire is the essence of my soul.

And from this fire. I can build my own. The home of my dreams. I think this fire with my hands.

And moving them softly and slowly towards every direction. I am dancing. I bring the flames of this fire. In every direction.

Creating through it. The walls , the rooms and the gardens of this dream house. With my home. I can build my own.

I recognize that every room has a chopper. It 's an order. I recognize that every room has a chopper. It 's an order.

That the wall is a little bit more. It 's an order. That the walls are my bones. The kitchen is my heart.

And the gardens are my projects. At the moment now. To the sign with my hands. It 's culture.

That the internet. This period that I want to manifest inside this house. I started to feel the mud , the clay , and between my hands. And I started to mold it.

I started to mold it. Such an intention to manifest this period of this house. That I want to manifest in this place. I want to manifest in this place.

And once I see this in front of me , I recognize that it incarnates all the web , the net , all the information , all the attributes that made my been. Why am I? And so with my senior , I send the intention to set life to it to manifest in a way it 's buried. I am the garden of this web.

I am the garden of this web. I am the garden of this web. I have this period to me. I have.

I have. Take a deep breath. And each one at its own time. Come back here and now.
