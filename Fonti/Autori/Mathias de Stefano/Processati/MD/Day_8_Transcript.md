## Overview

On the eighth day of alignment, the focus shifts to the knees, where the tree of life is anchored in our body. The knees represent our family history, connecting us to all ancestors who made us who we are today. The vibration "Mu" activates the portal to the path, allowing us to integrate and accept our entire genealogy. Today's code is contemplation, inviting us to go deep within and discover the beauty and potential of our inner world.

## Core Teaching

### The Tree of Life and Family History

The knees are the anchor point for the tree of life in our body. Each knee is connected to one parent—the left side relates to the mother, and the right side to the father. The energy stored in the knees represents our entire family history, including all ancestors who made us who we are today. Problems with the knees often reflect unresolved issues in our family tree or ancestral patterns that need acknowledgment and integration.

### Integration and Acceptance

Integration means observing and accepting everything that made us who we are. We must recognize that all our ancestors live within us, and we are the result of their experiences, choices, and paths. By accepting our history without judgment, we honor the roots of our own tree and allow the light of the "I Am" to nourish the seed of our path.

### The Path of History

The knees also represent the path of our own history. As we age, the weight of the tree of life becomes heavier, particularly as we approach the end of life. By working with the knees, we integrate every ancestor and walk our path with full awareness and coherence.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Find a comfortable seated position, preferably in the tetrahedron posture.
2. Stretch, massage your body, and yawn to discharge unnecessary energy.
3. Relax your body, letting the weight fall down, and focus on your breathing.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Breathe in softly, as if smelling a perfume, and hold the air inside before exhaling gently.
2. Focus on your breathing and feel the oxygen spreading through every cell of your body.
3. Bring your attention to the part of your body that feels uncomfortable, painful, or pleasurable. Observe without judgment.
4. Recognize the hottest part of your body, where emotions are stored, and allow yourself to feel the emotion present.
5. Catch the first thought that crosses your mind, and gather it with the emotion and bodily sensation as three spheres of light.
6. Bring these spheres to your knees and observe them together, allowing yourself to receive the idea of their connection.
7. With your hands or imagination, place the spheres between your knees, recognizing that they nourish the seed of your history.
8. Visualize all the people who made you who you are—your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents—connected to your knees.
9. Recognize that all of them are the roots of your own tree, and all of them live within you.
10. Feel the light of the "I Am" above your head, like the sun, and bring it down through your crown, third eye, throat, plexus, sacrum, root, and legs.
11. Allow the light to dissolve the three spheres, nourishing the seed in your knees with the energy of your history.
12. Pronounce the vibration "Mu" repeatedly, feeling the seed blossom into a burgundy flower.
13. Affirm: "I Am the Portal to the Path" several times, expanding the flower into the network of the world.
14. Recognize all the paths of history and how each flower connects to one another in the network.
15. Massage your knees softly, bringing the energy to the ground, and discharge all static energy.
16. Stretch, yawn, and gently open your eyes to return.

### Closing

After the practice, it is normal to feel nauseous, dizzy, or experience strong emotions. Walk barefoot on the ground to discharge static energy. Rest and allow yourself to integrate the information received.
