## Overview

On January 2nd, we explore the Law of Correspondence—the second Hermetic principle. Matias begins by noting that someone gave him a gift: a task book, and in very Capricorn fashion, he worked through writing until he reached the last day of Capricorn. He has the clue for the entire month already.

He also shares an important confession: he usually has no idea what he's saying before he says it. He's learning as he speaks, from what his higher self is saying. This itself is correspondence—the inner speaking through the outer. He couldn't understand many things he knows if it weren't for expressing them to others. **Me expressing it IS the correspondence. Maybe it seems he's teaching, but he's really learning as he speaks.**

Today we dive into the Law of Correspondence, which states that everything in the universe is a mirror to everything else. The famous phrase "as above, so below" comes from this law. Everything inside projects outside. Everything is corresponding to everything else through fractalization.

## Core Teaching

### The Second Hermetic Law

The Law of Correspondence could be called the second law, but in reality, it's the first one. Why? Because the main law—mentality—is not kind of the first one. It's the one that holds all the rest.

**Inside mentality exists the other laws.** Mentality is not the first law—it's the only law that contains all others. Inside it, the first aspect that appears is correspondence.

### The Seven Hermetic Laws

We're following the order of the chakras. The order we're presenting the laws is related to the chakras. Also, just to understand: the reason why we put this order (first law, second law, one, two, three, four, five) is because we as humans organize information from the beginning to the end.

But it's not exactly like this, the way in which the universe creates. There is no "one first" or "the beginning." There is no second, third appearing. **Basically, there is only one law, which is mentality, and inside of it we have different aspects that we call the principles of the universe.**

Those are the Hermetic principles of the universe. They kind of appear all at the same time because they are echoes of only one, which is mentality.

The reason why we organize them is because we are humans. That's the only reason. So we can understand it better.

### Who Was Hermes?

Just to understand who was the one that spoke and explained about this information: it was Hermes.

Hermes is the god of communication, the messenger in Greek mythology. Hermes was the one communicating between heaven and earth, between the gods and the earth. He was the one understanding all the concepts of the divine and how to download it here into matter.

In Roman mythology, we call him Mercury. In Egyptian mythology, we call it Thoth. But the Egyptian wouldn't say "Thoth"—that was a misspelling of Greek people. The name was **Djehuty** (Jajuti).

### Thoth: The Architect of Reality

Djehuty was the one that understood the laws of the universe because he said that everything was created in principles of numbers. He was a mathematician that understood that numbers were projected into geometry.

So he became an architect to understand it. Also, everything that exists—biology—is geometry. That's why he also was the god of medicine. He was the first physician.

He understood how to heal through music, through numbers, through geometry, through building. And he wrote the principles of how everything was created and he called it **the laws of the universe.**

He was the one that did the design to build the pyramids, for example. The concepts of the principles that he was teaching are called Hermeticism. That's why they created schools that were only for a few people.

They were like closing these teachings for a few, and that's why they call it the Hermetic school—because it was closed, it was hermetic, because of Hermes.

### Why Were the Hermetic Schools Closed?

Sometimes one of the questions is: why was this for just a few and closed to the people?

Well, at London times it was opened to everybody. But then we started to have these problems with the population. They started to blame the priests and priestesses because they were connected with the gods but there were problems on earth.

"If you're speaking with the gods, why do we have these problems?" So they started to persecute the priestesses. They started to migrate and close the schools. They were killed, they were persecuted, trapped, and killed in many cultures.

That's why they would hide themselves and just make some public tests to see who was really with the aptitudes to go into those schools.

After thousands of years of being persecuted and killed by many (Christians killed so many that thought differently, Islam persecuted many), that's why they closed everything. We wonder why they are so closed, but of course—they have been thousands of years trying to escape from being killed.

### The Hermetic Schools and Money

These people, it didn't matter the social level—if they were poor or rich. But there was a moment that in order to survive, they needed to be side by side with rich people, with kings, with republic presidents. They needed to have people with a lot of money so they could survive economically.

That's why they started to make these selective groups.

One of the things they also did—the reason why they were so closed to anybody—is because they were very focused: "We want to do this and teach this. We are not going to waste energy with people that don't really care."

"If you want to really do this, you will have to work for it."

### Protecting Energy

For example, the Hermetic people, the ones that are teaching all this, sometimes they say, "I don't want to waste my energy on people that don't want to listen or that say 'this should be free for everyone' and so on."

Because usually, when you really want to do something, you have to work hard for it. And there are a few people that don't want to waste their own energy trying to reach people. They just want to bring the energy to teach to those people who truly want it.

That's perfect because they are taking care of their own energy. That's why it's like a Hermetic school. "This is a school, so you have to get inside the school with a prescription, you have to pay"—and that's just to take care of the energy.

Matias shares: sometimes people come and do bad comments, not respecting him or the people listening and watching. He could rather close this and do it on campus where you have to pay. But he doesn't care about his energy in this because he has other things to do. So he does it in another way.

### The Law of Correspondence: Everything Is a Mirror

Now, let's begin with the topic for today: **Correspondence.**

We could say that the Law of Correspondence is the second law, but in reality we would say it's the first one. Because the main law, which is the only one that exists in the whole universe, is mentality. Mentality is not the first one—it's the one that holds all the rest.

Inside mentality exist the other ones. **The first one is correspondence.**

**The Law of Correspondence is born because of the thinking, the mentality.** Everything that exists is because of the mind. This means that everything is a projection of the mind.

When you look into something, you are basically receiving the things that you have within—not the things that are really there.

### Perception: Not Real, But Projection

Let's talk about the base of the correspondence and how to understand it through reflection.

Me expressing it is correspondence. Maybe it seems that I am here teaching, but what I'm really doing is learning as I speak. This is why there are some times that I get lost—like "what was I saying?"—because sometimes I don't even pay attention to myself.

So I cannot blame anyone if you are not paying attention, because sometimes I don't even pay attention to what I say.

**This is the correspondence: the inner speaking through the outer.**

### The Pen Example: What Is Real?

As an example: this pen. This pen is real. This is something important to understand because usually we make this mistake—we think about correspondence from the ego point of view.

The ego point of view says, "Okay, this pen doesn't exist because it only exists because of my inner perception."

**No, it's not that.** The pen exists because it's atoms that exist all around in the universe. They are organized. But the perception that I have of the pen is something that I have within.

Like the pen is blue and it's used to write because I am used to writing with the pen. But for some doctor, maybe it doesn't see this only as a pen—it's used as a tool to save someone in a tracheotomy, in the throat, to save life.

**It's according to the perception that you got in life how you see the things.**

### Relationships and Projection

For example, with a relation with someone, with a person:

When you have a relationship with a person, maybe that person (who is real, who exists) makes something to you that makes you feel bad. But that person had no idea that they made you feel bad. They just did something, and suddenly you feel very sad or mad with that person.

**But the reason why you feel that is inside of you.** The emotion is within you. We are receiving that person with our own point of view, of what makes us feel—not of what it is.

The person is something, but we perceive that person according to what we think inside.

### Fractalization: As Above, So Below

This base of mentality, through correspondence, spreads in the whole reality, in the whole world, by **fractalization.**

That's why you might have heard about the idea: **as above, so below.** Everything that is inside, so outside. Everything that is on the right is on the left. In the macrocosm, it's in the microcosm.

This conception, this idea that everything is corresponding to the other thing, is because the universe was created from one thing that divided. And this one, in polarity, is corresponding to this one.

So they have to match all the time, and they start to divide and to replicate the shapes.

**Everything, basically, in this mathematics of the universe, is a mirror to each other. So it corresponds to each other.**

### Co-Response: Shared Answers

The word correspondence means that everything is corresponding. The origin of the word is **co-respond.**

There is response of something—the answer. This means that everything in the universe is answering, responding to something in common. Co-respond. Something in common that we all have.

**That's why everything that you do, you receive it exactly as a response, as an answer, through the reflection of the universe. That's correspondence. It's an answer that is shared.**

### The "I Am" Creates, the Ego Interprets

To have it more clear: **it's the "I Am" who manifests the fractalization of all these responses.**

Correspondence—which is these shared answers in the universe—are created by the "I Am." And the ego self is the one that interprets those answers.

**It's not that me, the ego, creates this reality. It's the "I Am" who is all these realities—the answers. And it's the ego that has to interpret those answers.**

This one (the "I Am") has the goal to understand better the answer. This one (the ego) has the task to improve itself in the ways in which it interprets the answers that we all share.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Relax the body, sitting comfortably.
2. Focus on your breathing.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Take a moment to imagine that you are surrounded by a library.

2. In this huge library, organized in the way that you need, with all its books organized in these young halls.

3. Become aware that this library represents all the existence of your inner self.

4. Each book is a pattern that was registered, recorded through thousands of years of experiencing.

5. As you walk through the halls of books, become aware that this whole library is built in your own subconscious.

6. Become aware that each one of us is the only librarian from this library. Only we can find the right information within ourselves.

7. Make yourself the question: **What are my biggest projections, my biggest correspondences that I need to work with to heal?**

8. Take a deep breath and go through the books to find the one that within you has the answer.

9. Take this book with your hands, this information, and without judging it, go to the main hall where you find this big stair going to a lighted office.

10. Bring this book with you and go toward the stairs. They represent your unconscious. On the top of the office is the conscious.

11. Go through these stairs to bring this book to the light of consciousness, so you can make it from a pattern to a tool that you can use for your own benefit.

12. Go through the stairs, trying to think about what is this pattern of projections.

13. Reach the office of light.

14. Bring in all this light and clarity to this book, and with both hands, bring it to your third eye.

15. Repeat: **I am the stair to consciousness. I am the stair to consciousness.**

16. Make this pattern that limits you in the correspondence into a tool for your service.

17. Now that you made this limitation, this pattern, into a tool of consciousness, bring it all over your body to make it a part of you.

18. Take a deep breath.

### Closing

1. Each one at their own time, come back here and now.

2. Bring awareness to your body and surroundings.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Write down your biggest projections and correspondences in the world. What do you see in others that makes you react? What patterns keep showing up in your relationships? Become aware of how the outer world is a mirror of your inner world.

### Applying This Teaching

When someone or something in the outer world triggers you, pause and ask: "What is this reflecting about me?" Remember, the person or situation is real, but your perception and emotional reaction come from within. This is correspondence—the shared answer showing you what needs healing inside.

## Q&A

### Q: What is the difference between mentality and correspondence?

Mentality is the only law—it holds all the others. It states that everything is a perception of the mind. Correspondence is the first aspect within mentality. It's how the mind projects itself—through mirroring, fractalization, "as above, so below." Mentality is the container; correspondence is the first expression.

### Q: Why were the Hermetic schools closed to the public?

For thousands of years, priests and priestesses were persecuted and killed by Christians, Islam, and other religions for teaching differently. To survive, they had to hide, migrate, and close their schools. They only allowed in those who truly wanted to learn and were willing to work for it. It's not elitism—it's survival and energy protection.

### Q: How is teaching also learning through correspondence?

When Matias expresses something, the inner "I Am" speaks through the outer voice. He learns by speaking because the act of expressing brings the inner to the outer. This is correspondence in action—the inner projecting through the outer, creating a shared answer that teaches both speaker and listener.

### Q: If everything is perception, is anything real?

Yes. The pen is real—it's atoms organized in the universe. The person is real. But your perception of the pen (as a writing tool vs. a medical tool) and your emotional reaction to the person (based on your past) come from within you. The object exists; your interpretation is projection.

### Q: What does "as above, so below" really mean?

It means the universe was created from one thing that divided and replicated itself through fractalization. Everything in the macrocosm (the big picture) is mirrored in the microcosm (the small picture). The patterns of the cosmos are the same as the patterns in your body, in your relationships, in your thoughts. Everything is a mirror.

### Q: What is the difference between the "I Am" and the ego in correspondence?

The "I Am" is the unlimited mind that creates the fractalization—all the shared answers, all the mirrors. The ego is the limited self that interprets those answers. The "I Am" projects; the ego perceives. The "I Am" is the reality; the ego is the perception of reality.

### Q: How can I use correspondence to heal?

When you see something in the outer world that triggers you, recognize it as a correspondence—a mirror of something within you. Ask: "What is this reflecting?" Then take that awareness to your inner library (subconscious), find the book (the pattern), bring it to the light of consciousness (third eye), and transform it from a limitation into a tool you can use.

### Q: What does "co-respond" mean?

Correspondence comes from "co-respond"—a shared response. Everything in the universe is responding to something in common that we all have (the "I Am"). When you act, the universe responds with a shared answer—a mirror. What you do comes back to you not as punishment, but as a shared echo, a co-response.
