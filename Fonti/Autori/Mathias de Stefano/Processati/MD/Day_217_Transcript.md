# Day 217 - The Seventh Dimension: The Core of Light

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Root
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Emotional Week
- **Main Topic:** The Seventh Dimension - The Core, the 12 Rays, and the Path to Enlightenment
- **Vibration:** `Mo`
- **Statement:** `I Am Love in All Creation`
- **Code:** To be - the first act of the universe, to be. It is the one that gives sense to existence itself. Everything is part of the same being, of an entity that it is, that expresses from within. The first name of the divine is "I Am"—attribute that makes it be acknowledged as a singularity, the only one from where everything originates and where everything returns to. At the same time, everything that has developed from it is still a part of a projected body. The greatest attribute is being who you are without pretending to be someone else.

## Overview

Today we explore the seventh dimension—the core of all creation, the center point where light is born. This is the dimension of enlightenment, but not enlightenment as an end goal. Enlightenment in the seventh dimension is a part of the process, a seed, a nectar that allows us to become creators ourselves.

Why connect the seventh dimension, which seems so ethereal and light, with the root chakra, the genitals, the most earthy and sexual part of the body? Because the seventh dimension is the seed, the generative power, the orgasm of the universe that expands throughout all creation. It is the most fundamental, primal force—just as the root chakra is the foundation of life force in the body.

## Building the Seventh Dimension: The Trinity

### The First Dimension: The Line

In the first dimension, we have positive and negative. These two are willing to get in touch, but they cannot, because one must bend toward the other. This creates the second dimension.

### The Second Dimension: The Need for a Third

In the second dimension, we have two points connected by a line, but they are not touching directly. This does not have logic. They need a third option to connect them as one.

That is why the trinity is the base of everything. The triangle is the base of all the platonic solids, all figures, all systems. All cultures and religions speak about the Holy Trinity—not just the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but the fundamental geometric truth: positive, negative, and the connection that unites them.

### From Triangle to Sphere

From the triangle, it goes to the square. From the square to the pentagon. From the pentagon to the hexagon. It multiplies: eight lines, ten lines, more and more, until suddenly you have a circle.

A circle is a triangle multiplied by thousands in two dimensions. A sphere is a circle multiplied by thousands in three dimensions.

If a triangle multiplied by thousands creates a circle, then a tetrahedron multiplied by thousands creates a sphere. And where do they multiply? In the sixth dimension, through fractalization.

### The Core: Where All Angles Meet

If this is a triangle willing to find the point of balance, you trace lines from each corner to the center. That creates a tetrahedron—a three-dimensional structure with a core.

When this triangle is multiplied by thousands, there are no longer only three lines holding the pattern. There are billions and thousands of crosses all around, creating a point of tension called the core.

The core of a sphere is where the billions of angles set their pressure toward the center. As much more pressure, the electrons start to vibrate faster and faster because of friction. This creates heat, which creates energy and light.

This is why when we see lava from a volcano, we see light. The rocks melt and produce light. How can a rock produce light? Because of the pressure—the electrons trying to get out create heat, energy, and light.

The core of a star, the core of a planet—the pressure is so much that it creates enlightenment. The core is light.

## The Sixth and Seventh Dimensions Together

From the sixth dimension, we see many options, thousands of possibilities of time and space creating options. In the third dimension, these three directions create fixed points. To create energy, we need the six directions of the third dimension.

In the sixth dimension, to get enlightenment, illumination, we need to go through six dimensions. The six dimensions give us 12 directions.

### The 12 Rays and the 12 Zodiac Signs

These 12 directions are the attributes we use in the zodiac signs: I Can, I See, I Believe, I Use, I Create, etc.—the different attributes of the self, the mantras we use each month.

When I go through all the path and integrate all the attributes of the self (I Can, I See, I Know, I Believe, I Use...), when I activate these 12 attributes, I light myself in the center. That is the moment when I go to the seventh dimension.

To light myself from the third dimension, I have to integrate all the aspects of all the possibilities of my times and spaces, integrating them as one. It is complicated, but we can do it. The seventh dimension is the path of enlightenment.

It is very difficult. It takes a lot of pressure to get there. But once you reach the center, all the forces that were pressing you suddenly disappear, because all the forces together equal zero.

In order to reach the enlightenment of the seventh dimension, I need to go through the pressure of all timelines and all spaces. But when I arrive at the core, at the point, I do not feel pressure anymore. I am free from that. I am here.

## The 12 Rays and the Archangels

We have 12 paths that activate the attributes of the "I." These 12 paths are what we call the 12 rays: the white ray, the blue ray, the pink ray, the orange ray, the golden ray—all the rays that masters speak about.

The masters take power from the archangels. The archangels are 12—the main ones. But they are not beings with human forms. They are attributes of light from the seventh dimension. They are potentials. That is why they are called potestates—the potentials.

The archangels are attributes of the divine:
- Uriel: the light of God (El = God)
- Gabriel: the power of God
- Michael: who like God
- Raphael: the physician of God

These are the 12 rays from the seventh dimension.

When we ask the archangels, we are not asking an outer being outside. We are talking to an attribute of ourselves in the seventh dimension that projects us here.

We are a projection. We have the divine potential (potestates), the archangels, the angels, the masters, the guides, and us. With this picture, we can say there are not different beings. They are different echoes—different echoes of myself. I would be the last echo of many other beings.

## Why Seek Enlightenment? The Flower Metaphor

Why are we looking for enlightenment? Why do we seek to go to the seventh dimension?

Because the seventh dimension holds the potential of creation itself. It is the seed, the nectar. If we are willing to become creators ourselves, we must go to the seventh dimension to reach the power that allows us to create.

Enlightenment is not an end, a goal. It is a part of the process.

### The Sun, the Earth, and Photosynthesis

Imagine a star, a sun, radiating light through one of the 12 rays—let us say the seventh ray, the violet ray. That planet or star has the attributes of the violet ray.

Around this sun, we have Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury. How do we get the energy from the sun? We take its energy to create life.

On Earth, plants are the best at this, through photosynthesis. They absorb the information of the sun. They store its energy and distribute the rays of light. We have different flowers, different colors in nature, all coming from the seventh dimension.

Our planet uses the energy of the sun to create and manifest things. We use the nectar of the sun to create honey.

### The Flower, the Bees, and the Nectar

The light from the seventh dimension is processed by the leaves of a plant through photosynthesis. They create the potential of the flower. The flower radiates light, time, and space. Around it, we have the nectar, and the bees come to pick up the nectar. They take the pollen with them, and with the pollen they pollinate flowers. With the nectar, they create honey.

A flower is light. Insects see flowers like we see the light of cities—they can see in ultraviolet light. A flower shining in nature is like a star to an insect. They are attracted to that shining, they smell the sugar, they go to the light, attracted by the perfume of the light.

They take the nectar, they absorb it, ecstatic with all the energy it gives them. By doing that, they take the pollen and pollinate all the flowers. With the nectar, they create honey. While they do this, they pollinate the whole forest, creating many other options of flowers of light through experience.

### Translating to Human Experience

We are looking for light, for enlightenment. To find enlightenment, we have to drink the nectar. Nectar means death in Greek. In ancient traditions, they said whoever drinks the sweet death becomes eternal, immortal. That is why the gods eat only nectar—the sweet death.

By feeling that, we are attracted by the light of the seventh dimension because the beings of this dimension need to expand to feel the pleasure that is the experience. The seventh dimension is so powerful, so orgasmic, that it needs to expand this orgasm throughout the whole universe.

It is like the trees, the plants, the Earth in spring. This is why we are attracted to the power of enlightenment—the ecstasy of enlightenment.

When we reach the light, we transform it into honey, to use pollen as attributes. We start to have our gifts. A person with the gift of music from birth, writers from the heart, any gift you can imagine—these are the honey, the crystallization of the nectar. Our talents are like a crystallization of eternity. Our gifts are the crystallization of eternity.

The divine rays are not something external. They are projecting us.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing.

### Expanding Into the Void

Take a deep breath, becoming aware of your body and the space you are in. Use your imagination to expand the room—the walls, the roof, the floor—all of it expanding toward the infinite, letting yourself float in the middle of the universal void.

### Recognizing Yourself as the Core

Take a deep breath and recognize yourself as the center of your own world. Your things, people, thoughts, feelings, experiences—all of them around you create a sphere from which you are the core.

Recognize that this world around you is setting all its pressure upon you. All your beliefs, your mind, emotions, your life, your history, relationships, attachments, projects, future, intentions—all of it at the same distance, pushing toward you. Feel the pressure of your entire world.

### Igniting the Light

Take a deep breath and start to feel how this pressure creates power, strength, energy. The friction starts to create heat that turns your body into fire that ignites, expanding light.

Feel how this light becomes colors—the 12 rays of light shining toward every direction, lightning your world from within. Ignite the power of your being.

### The Vibration Mo

Sound the vibration Mo from your root chakra, feeling the generative power of creation.

I am light.  
I am the creator of all things.  
I am the light, I am the life, I am the love.  

This light that I have is the potential of my gift. I use this potential to crystallize, to manifest all of them in what I can become, in all my beings.

I Am love in all creation.  
I Am the seed and the nectar of all creation.  
I Am love in all creation.

### Closing

Take a deep breath and gently return to here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, meditate on your gifts and talents. See them not as random abilities but as the crystallization of light from the seventh dimension. What nectar have you drunk? What pollen are you spreading?

Practice feeling the pressure of your life not as burden but as the friction that creates your inner light. Every challenge, every relationship, every experience is pressing toward your core, creating the heat that will ignite your enlightenment.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel overwhelmed by life's pressures, remember: you are at the core of a sphere where all forces press equally, and at the center, they cancel out to zero. The more pressure, the more potential for light.

When you seek enlightenment, remember: it is not about escaping the world but about integrating all 12 attributes, all possibilities, all timelines, until you ignite from within.

When you call on archangels or guides, remember: you are calling on attributes of your own seventh-dimensional self. They are not outside you. They are echoes of your highest potential.

## Q&A

### Q: Why is the seventh dimension connected to the root chakra and not the crown?

Because the seventh dimension is the seed, the generative power, the orgasmic expansion of creation. The root chakra is where life force originates, where sexuality and creation reside. Both are about fundamental, primal generative power. The crown receives; the root generates.

### Q: If archangels are just attributes, not beings, does that mean prayers to them are meaningless?

No. Attributes are real. When you pray to Archangel Michael, you are invoking the attribute of "who like God"—divine protection and strength. You are activating that quality within your own seventh-dimensional self. The prayer is not to an external being but to an aspect of your own divine nature.

### Q: How can I reach the seventh dimension if it requires integrating all 12 attributes?

Through the journey of life, through the zodiac year, through experiencing and embodying each quality: I Can, I See, I Believe, I Use, I Create, I Feel, I Know, I Want, I Analyze, I Transcend, I Transform, I Am. As you live fully, you naturally integrate them all.

### Q: What is the nectar, practically speaking?

The nectar is the sweet death—the willingness to die to the ego, to limitations, to separation. When you drink this (accept transformation), you become immortal (realize your eternal nature). Practically, it is every moment of surrender, every letting go, every acceptance of change.

### Q: If all forces cancel out to zero at the core, does that mean enlightenment is nothingness?

It is freedom from pressure, but it is not empty. It is the zero point from which all creation springs. It is the still point where infinite potential resides. Zero is not nothing—it is everything before it manifests.

### Q: How do I know which ray or attribute I am working with?

Look at your life focus. If you are learning power and will, you may be on the red ray. If you are developing wisdom and vision, the blue ray. Your challenges and gifts show you which ray you are crystallizing into honey.

### Q: Can I work with multiple rays at once?

Yes. You contain all 12. But usually, one or two are dominant in a particular lifetime or phase. The goal is not to pick one but to integrate all 12 through the journey of your soul's evolution.
