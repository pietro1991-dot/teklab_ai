## Overview

On the eleventh day of alignment, we enter the second week dedicated to emotion and the soul. We shift our focus from the mind to the emotional body, working with the crown chakra to balance the energy of the soul. This week is about understanding that emotion means energy in motion—the very pulse of life that makes us who we are.

The vibration "Ha" combines the sound "H" (representing history and life itself) with "A" (representing the spirit and higher consciousness). Today's statement is "I Am the Spiritual Life," and the code is contemplation into the process of transcendence. This means looking again at the future as present and the past without judgment or intention, allowing ourselves to love everything that was, is, and will be. We take everything and turn it into neutrality, loving unconditionally through time and space.

This session begins with a comprehensive teaching on the nature of the soul, emotion, energy, and the magnetic field. We learn that the soul is not separate from emotion—they are the same thing. The soul is the registry, the record of everything we are, and emotion is the energy that moves, creates, and makes us be who we are.

## Core Teaching

### Understanding Emotion and the Soul

Emotion means energy in motion. We usually relate emotion with the soul, and in truth, emotion and soul are exactly the same thing. Emotion is the energy that moves, whether positive or negative, creating all the energy that makes us be who we are. The soul is the concept that holds within all the energy that made us be.

When we talk about the soul, we are talking about the registry, the records of everything that we are. The soul is the book where we have written everything that we have experienced, that we have been, what we are, and what we will become. The soul is also the one registering and making the registry of all the data we are taking from relationships with others.

### The Soul as Energy in Motion

We all know that energy is transforming constantly. It is endless, going through time and space, changing its shapes and adapting to different bodies—from our body to a plant, to an animal, to other people, and so on. This allows us to live different lives in different times of history. That is what we call "the soul has lived many lives."

The soul is like the book where we have written everything, but it is also the energy itself—the pulses of positive and negative that create life. The soul is not just in the heart; it is in every part of our self, in every part of our being where the energy is pulsing. This is why we also call the soul the "key of life," because the soul, the energy, is these pulses of positive and negative constantly creating. This is life.

### Many Souls, One Soul

We have to understand that we have one soul, but we also have another soul that relates with the group of people around us. We have another one that relates with millions of beings, and we have another one for the cosmos. We have many souls, and they are all part of the same one.

We can compare the soul to our body. We have one soul that is created with billions of cells. Imagine that you are a soul, and each cell has another soul or is part of that soul. That is why we are all the same.

### The Soul as Perception and Projection

One of the things we have to understand about the soul is that the soul is a perception, a projection from our idea. Everything you may believe or think about a soul—like karma, dharma, the lives you have lived, another being with its own shape, the pacts you have done in your soul—everything you could possibly believe about a soul is usually just a projection from your human perspective of the energy. It is your mind trying to shape the concept of how the energy moves.

If you go to the base of what a soul is, you will find just energetical pulses. These pulses of energy are the ones that storage all the data and information and share all the information. That is why we know the soul is recording all the information.

### Polarity and Creativity

One of the important pieces of information is that the energy, the soul, is positive and negative. By polarity, it constantly creates energy. That is why we relate the soul with being creative and artistic. The energy, by being positive and negative, moves like in a spiral constantly. It also gives us the idea of transference—to transfer energy. By the transferring of the energy, we understand the emotion. It is the relation with other people, with other beings.

### Emotions as Energetical Pulses

These emotions are energetical pulses that allow us to transfer and share information. It is like if each one of us is a neuron, and everything we share in the transference of energy is perceived by us as an emotion. The others are a different energy, and when they match with ours, they discharge information. We have to understand that the relationships we have with other people are exactly as if we put a neuron with another neuron. They make these charges of pulses of energy—positive and negative—and they create synapses. By synapses, they create information; they create a thought, an idea. These pulses can also be known as soul.

All of the emotions are energy perceived by our point of view. This is why, if I can handle my own energies, my own emotions, I am not moved by the energies from the outside. When we achieve this, we accomplish being in a neutral state. This is the main goal we need to find—balance in our emotions.

### Perception and the Magnetic Field

Sometimes we make a big mistake thinking that we have to control our emotions. What we have to do instead is to order the perception of the energy—our perception of the energy. When I realize about my perception of an emotion, of an energy, I know how to handle the energy or the emotion or my perception of it.

The energetical system is very easy to understand but difficult to handle. It is everywhere, and you cannot take all the energies. Let's talk about the experience in this perception. For example, something happens that makes us angry. You have to watch in that moment—the thing that happened, the fact, is not what makes us angry. It is our perception of the situation, of the fact.

The same fact, for example, is perceived by me as making me angry. If you ask another person, maybe the same thing doesn't provoke them—it creates another feeling. Everything that happens comes with energy, and it is perceived and received by my own magnetic field and transformed into the level of my own magnetic field so I could understand it.

### The Magnetic Field as Translator

We can say the energy is like languages, and the magnetic field is the translator of the language. This energy that comes to me will be perceived by my soul or my magnetic field according to the state of that magnetic field and translated into its own way of understanding. It is the state of my soul that interprets the emotion. I don't have to touch the emotion; what I have to do is to reorganize my magnetic field.

### Balancing the Magnetic Field

If I allow myself to balance the magnetic field, I am able to receive and perceive the emotions in a neutral way. If someone comes and tries to make me angry, I will touch the energy of the anger and make it into something constructive. This is taking your own energy and using it to your own benefit.

We are humans, and as humans, we are poetic, creative, and expressive. We need to spread thousands of ideas to understand emotions. But in truth, it is very easy—it is just positive and negative. Thinking in this way might make it feel very mental, just with the mind, but what helps us is to understand the mechanism. Once I understand the map of how it works, I can go into the practice, which is just feeling it.

### The Map of Emotion: Summary

- Every emotion is just an energy.
- It is positive and negative; both of them are the polarity that creates energy.
- This energy creates an energetical field that we call the soul.
- The soul is taking as much information as it can, going into different shapes, transforming itself through different lives. This is what makes the soul the eternal life.
- When a soul meets another soul, it is again like a positive and a negative. When both of them transmit energy, it is called emotion.
- The information of the emotion is captured by my magnetic field according to my level of vibration—if I am positive or I am negative.
- This makes all the emotions just a perception of my state of energy.
- If I allow myself to balance the magnetic field, I am able to receive and perceive the emotions in a neutral way.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Reflect on the emotions you have felt today and recognize them as energy in motion. Observe how your perception of situations creates your emotional response. Practice balancing your magnetic field by recognizing that all emotions are simply energy, and you have the power to transform them through your perception.
