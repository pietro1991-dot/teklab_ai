## Overview

On the eve of the great December 21, 2020 alignment, we explore intention as the bridge between today and tomorrow, between potential and manifestation, between consciousness and creation. We discover that tomorrow doesn't simply happen TO us - it is created BY us through the intention we hold today. This teaching prepares us for the massive planetary shift occurring tomorrow by helping us understand our role: not as passive recipients of cosmic energies but as active co-creators who focus universal consciousness into specific manifestation through clear intention. The throat chakra carries this teaching because intention must be SPOKEN, DECLARED, EXPRESSED to become real - silent wishes remain in the realm of potential, but spoken intentions move into manifestation.

## The Word Tomorrow

**TOMORROW** - that strange time that never arrives because when it comes, it's called "today."

### The Paradox

**Tomorrow doesn't actually exist as a time you can experience.**

When tomorrow arrives, you don't experience it AS tomorrow - you experience it as today.

**Tomorrow is always just ahead, never quite here.**

**Yet tomorrow is where we place all our hopes, fears, plans, and dreams:**
- "Tomorrow I'll start exercising"
- "Tomorrow things will be better"
- "Tomorrow I'll tell them I love them"
- "Tomorrow I'll begin my purpose"

**Tomorrow is the eternal refuge of procrastination and projection.**

### The Etymology

**TOMORROW** comes from "to" + "morrow"

**MORROW** is from Old English "morgen" meaning "morning"

**TOMORROW literally means "to the morning" - to the next beginning**

**Every tomorrow is a new morning, a fresh start, another beginning.**

### The Spiritual Teaching

**Tomorrow represents POTENTIAL - what has not yet manifested but could.**

**Tomorrow is the field of all possibilities not yet chosen.**

**Tomorrow is where intention becomes creation.**

**And here's the key:** ***Tomorrow is created by the INTENTION you hold today.***

## What Is Intention?

### The Etymology

**INTENTION** comes from Latin **"INTENDERE":**

- **IN** = toward, into
- **TENDERE** = to stretch, to strain, to aim

**Intention literally means "to stretch toward" or "to aim at."**

**It's not passive wishing - it's active directing.**

### Intention vs. Hope vs. Wish

**Important distinctions:**

**WISH:**
- Passive
- "I wish things were different"
- Energy stays internal
- No responsibility taken

**HOPE:**
- Slightly more active
- "I hope it works out"
- Energy is expressed but not focused
- Outcome depends on external factors

**INTENTION:**
- Fully active
- "I intend to create this"
- Energy is focused and directed
- Responsibility is claimed

**INTENTION is conscious choice + focused will + directed energy.**

**It's the difference between:**
- "I wish I had a better life" (wish)
- "I hope my life improves" (hope)
- "I intend to create positive change in my life" (intention)

**Only intention has power to create tomorrow.**

## Intention as Cosmic Force

**This teaching says: "I am the intention of the cosmos"**

**What does this mean?**

### The Universe as Intention

Remember earlier teachings:
- The universe began as void (formless potential)
- The void projected its potential outward (intention to manifest)
- All forms emerged from this original intention

**The Big Bang was the universe's INTENTION to experience itself in form.**

**Every galaxy, star, planet, being - all are manifestations of original cosmic intention.**

### You as Cosmic Intention

**You are not separate from this cosmic force.**

**The same intention that projected universe into existence is the intention operating THROUGH you.**

**When you set an intention, you're not a tiny human begging the universe for favors.**

**You ARE the universe focusing its creative power through this specific point of consciousness called "you."**

**Your intentions are cosmic intentions localized.**

**This means:**
- Your intentions have universal creative power (because you ARE the universe)
- Your intentions matter to the whole (because you're a node in the cosmic network)
- Your intentions co-create reality (because reality is being generated by collective consciousness)

**You are not powerless - you are the intention of the cosmos itself.**

## The Throat Chakra: Speaking Creation

**The teaching comes to THROAT CHAKRA because:**

**Intention must be SPOKEN to move from potential to manifestation.**

### Silent Intention vs. Spoken Intention

**Silent intention** (held in mind/heart):
- Exists in realm of potential
- Has power but no grounding
- Can remain vague and shifting
- Doesn't fully commit the self

**Spoken intention** (expressed through throat):
- Moves from potential into manifestation
- Grounds the energy in physical vibration
- Becomes concrete and specific
- Commits the self fully

**When you SPEAK your intention:**
- It vibrates into physical reality (sound waves)
- Your body hears and aligns with it
- The universe receives clear signal
- You take responsibility for it

**This is why vows, declarations, affirmations, prayers are SPOKEN.**

**Speech is the bridge from consciousness to creation.**

### The Creative Power of the Word

**In many traditions:** "In the beginning was the Word..."

**The Word = Intention spoken into manifestation**

**God/Source didn't just think creation - it SPOKE creation: "Let there be light"**

**Similarly, your intentions become creative when you SPEAK them:**

- "I intend to embody love more fully"
- "I intend to contribute to planetary awakening"
- "I intend to heal this pattern"
- "I intend to manifest authentic livelihood"

**Speaking makes it real.**

**The throat chakra is your creative word, your personal "Let there be..."**

## Preparing for Tomorrow: December 21, 2020

**This teaching (Day 139) comes on December 20, 2020.**

**Tomorrow is the great conjunction, the Bethlehem Star, the portal opening.**

### Why Intention Matters NOW

**The cosmic energies align tomorrow, but what humanity DOES with those energies depends on COLLECTIVE INTENTION.**

**Think of it like this:**

The alignment is like a massive door opening.

But whether humanity walks through that door toward awakening or stays in old patterns depends on WHERE WE FOCUS OUR INTENTION.

**The energies are neutral - they amplify whatever we're focusing on:**
- If we focus on fear, division, suffering - that gets amplified
- If we focus on love, unity, awakening - that gets amplified

**This is why GLOBAL MEDITATION matters tomorrow:**

When millions of people align their intention simultaneously:
- We create coherent signal (like lasers aligning light waves)
- We focus the cosmic energies toward specific outcome
- We co-create the tomorrow we intend

**We're not begging the universe to save us.**

**We ARE the universe, consciously choosing what to create with the energies available.**

### What to Intend

**Tomorrow (Day 140), specific meditation and intention will be given.**

**But today, prepare your personal intention:**

**Ask yourself:**
- What do I intend to create in the new cycle beginning tomorrow?
- What do I intend to embody more fully?
- What do I intend to contribute to collective awakening?
- What do I intend to release from the old paradigm?
- What do I intend to birth into the new?

**Get clear. Get specific. Get aligned.**

**Tomorrow, you'll speak this intention into the cosmic opening.**

## The Responsibility of Intention

**With great power comes great responsibility.**

**If you ARE the intention of the cosmos, you're RESPONSIBLE for what you create.**

### You Can't Blame Tomorrow

**Many people treat tomorrow as something that happens TO them:**

- "What will tomorrow bring?" (as if it's outside your control)
- "I hope tomorrow is better" (passive waiting)
- "Tomorrow will tell" (abdication of responsibility)

**But this teaching says: YOU CREATE TOMORROW with the intention you hold today.**

**If tomorrow is difficult, ask:** "What was I intending (consciously or unconsciously)?"

**If tomorrow is beautiful, acknowledge:** "I participated in creating this."

### Conscious vs. Unconscious Intention

**You're ALWAYS intending - the question is whether you're doing it consciously.**

**Unconscious intentions:**
- Fears you hold (intending what you fear)
- Beliefs you carry (intending confirmation of beliefs)
- Patterns you repeat (intending familiar even if painful)

**Conscious intentions:**
- Deliberately chosen focus
- Aligned with your values and truth
- Clearly spoken and claimed
- Reviewed and adjusted regularly

**The shift from unconscious to conscious intention is the shift from victim to creator.**

## Living from Intention

**How do we embody this teaching daily?**

### 1. Morning Intention Setting

**Each morning (tomorrow) begins with intention:**

- What do I intend for this day?
- Who do I intend to be today?
- What do I intend to create?
- How do I intend to respond to challenges?

**SPEAK it aloud (throat chakra activation).**

**Make it specific, positive, aligned with your deepest truth.**

### 2. Aligning Actions with Intention

**Intention without action is fantasy.**

**Throughout the day, check:** "Are my actions aligned with my stated intention?"

**If you intend peace but engage in conflict, there's misalignment.**

**If you intend abundance but act from scarcity, there's misalignment.**

**Course-correct: bring actions into alignment with intention.**

### 3. Evening Reflection

**Each evening, reflect:**

- Did I live my intention today?
- Where was I aligned? Where did I forget?
- What do I need to adjust for tomorrow?

**This closes the loop - tomorrow becomes today, you review, you refine intention for next tomorrow.**

### 4. Releasing Attachment to Outcome

**Paradox: Hold clear intention but don't cling to specific outcome.**

**You intend the direction but allow the universe to handle the details.**

**Like archer:** You aim carefully (intention) then release the arrow (trust).

**Obsessing over exactly how/when intention manifests actually blocks the flow.**

**Set intention clearly, then allow space for it to manifest in ways you might not have imagined.**

## Guided Practice: Claiming Your Intention

**This practice prepares you for tomorrow's global meditation:**

1. Sit or stand, spine straight
2. Bring attention to your **throat chakra** (front and back of throat)
3. Place fingers gently on throat
4. Breathe deeply, feeling throat expand and contract
5. Visualize a bright blue light at your throat - your creative word
6. Reflect on tomorrow (December 21 or whatever "tomorrow" means for you)
7. Ask yourself: **"What do I intend to create?"**
8. Let an answer arise - don't force it, let it come from deep within
9. Once you have your intention, refine it:
   - Make it positive (what you want, not what you don't want)
   - Make it specific (concrete, clear)
   - Make it aligned (true to your deepest values)
10. Now, **SPEAK your intention aloud:**
    - "I intend to..."
    - "I am the intention to..."
11. Feel how speaking it makes it more real
12. Speak it again, louder, claiming it fully
13. Notice sensations in throat - this is creative power activating
14. Now expand awareness:
    - You are not alone in this intention
    - Millions are intending awakening simultaneously
    - Your intention joins the collective intention
15. Visualize tomorrow:
    - See the planetary alignment in the sky
    - See millions of people meditating
    - See the grid lighting up as intentions align
    - See the new cycle beginning
16. Speak: **"I am the intention of the cosmos"**
17. Feel yourself not as small human wishing but as cosmic creative force focused through this form
18. Breathe into throat, sealing the intention
19. Trust that it is already manifesting
20. Return to the present, knowing: Tomorrow is being created by the intention you hold today

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Start a 21-day "Intention Journal" beginning today. Each morning, write your primary intention for that day in one clear sentence. Each evening, reflect on how that intention manifested (or didn't) and what you learned. Notice patterns: Do you set vague intentions? Do you forget your intention by noon? Do you set intentions your actions contradict? This practice builds the muscle of conscious intention-setting and trains you to see the direct link between intention and manifestation.

### Applying This Teaching

Tomorrow morning, before checking phone/email/news, sit quietly and ask: "What do I intend for this day?" Let an answer arise from your deepest truth, not from your to-do list. Speak it aloud three times, feeling your throat chakra activate. Write it where you'll see it throughout the day. Then live AS IF this intention is already true. Notice how differently your day unfolds when you BEGIN with clear conscious intention versus when you just react to whatever comes.

## Q&A

### Q: How is intention different from goal-setting or manifestation techniques?

**Intention is the conscious focus that underlies goals and manifestation.** A goal is specific outcome ("I want to weigh 150 pounds"). Manifestation technique is method ("I'll visualize and affirm"). Intention is the deeper WHY and the energetic direction ("I intend to embody vibrant health"). Goals and techniques can serve intention, but intention is primary. You can achieve goals while violating your deepest intention (lose weight through unhealthy means) or fail to achieve goals while honoring intention (maintain health even if weight doesn't change). Intention aligns you with truth; goals are navigational markers.

### Q: What if I set clear intention but things don't manifest the way I intended?

**Several possibilities:** 1) The manifestation is occurring but not in the form you expected - stay open; 2) Your conscious intention conflicts with unconscious intentions (fears/beliefs) - deeper work needed; 3) Your intention isn't actually aligned with your highest good or collective good - universe redirects; 4) Timing isn't right yet - patience required; 5) You're attached to specific outcome rather than direction - release grip. Check: Am I attached to exact form of manifestation or to the essence/feeling of what I intend? Intention sets direction; universe handles routing.

### Q: Can my individual intention really matter when there are billions of people with different intentions?

**Yes, for two reasons:** 1) Quantum physics shows consciousness affects reality at fundamental level - your focused intention literally changes probability fields; 2) Collective consciousness is sum of individual consciousnesses - your clear intention contributes to the whole like one candle contributes to total light in a room. When you align your intention with others' (like global meditation), the effect amplifies exponentially (coherence creates power). You're not separate drop trying to change ocean - you're the ocean at this specific point, and your movement affects the whole.

### Q: How do I know if an intention is coming from ego vs. true self?

**Feel into it:** **Ego-based intentions** feel tight, grasping, comparative ("I want this to be better than them"), fear-driven ("I need this to feel safe/worthy"), or compensatory ("This will finally make me enough"). **True-self intentions** feel expansive, generous, aligned with service ("This will allow me to contribute more"), growth-oriented ("This helps me embody my values"), or joyful ("This expresses my authentic nature"). Also check: Does this intention honor the wellbeing of others or require their diminishment? True self never intends at others' expense; ego often does.

### Q: What if I don't know what to intend because I'm confused about what I want?

**Start simpler:** Instead of intending specific outcomes you're unclear about, intend the process of clarity itself: "I intend to discover what's true for me" or "I intend to hear my inner guidance clearly" or "I intend to release confusion and welcome clarity." You can also intend qualities rather than outcomes: "I intend to embody peace/love/courage today" even if you don't know what that will look like in practice. Intention doesn't require having everything figured out - it's actually the tool FOR figuring things out. Confusion is fine; unconsciousness is what we're addressing.

### Q: How does speaking intention aloud help if I live alone and no one hears it?

**You don't speak intention for others to hear - you speak it for multiple reasons:** 1) YOUR body hears it - your cells, your subconscious, your energy field all receive the spoken word more fully than silent thought; 2) Speaking makes it REAL - thought is ethereal, sound is physical vibration; 3) Speaking commits you - there's a power in hearing yourself claim something out loud; 4) The universe/"field"/quantum foam "hears" it as vibration - intention as sound wave moves into manifest reality; 5) Speaking activates throat chakra - the creative power of the word. Even alone, speak your intentions. The power isn't in being heard; it's in speaking.

### Q: Can I set intentions for other people (like intending they heal or change)?

**Tricky territory.** You cannot violate others' free will or sovereignty with your intention - that's manipulation, even if well-meaning. What you CAN do: Intend that they have what they need for their highest good (without deciding what that is); intend to be a beneficial presence in their life; intend your own healing around the relationship. But you cannot intend they make specific choices or become what you think they should be. This violates spiritual law. Focus your intention on YOURSELF - your responses, your energy, your contribution - and trust each being has their own relationship with their own intentions and path.

### Q: What's the difference between this teaching and "Law of Attraction" or "manifesting"?

**This teaching has different emphasis:** Law of Attraction often focuses on getting what you want through aligning vibration (sometimes with materialistic emphasis). This teaching focuses on recognizing you ARE cosmic creative force, which comes with RESPONSIBILITY not just power. The emphasis is on alignment with deepest truth and collective good, not on manifesting desires. Also, this teaching places intention in context of spiritual awakening (like tomorrow's alignment) rather than primarily material gain. Both address consciousness creating reality, but this teaching emphasizes the sacred nature of intention and the responsibility to use it wisely for evolution of whole, not just personal comfort.

**Reflection:** Here we stand on December 20, 2020, on the threshold of the great conjunction that will bring Jupiter and Saturn into alignment for the first time in 800 years, creating the Bethlehem Star and opening a portal that humanity has been moving toward for ages, and we learn the truth that makes us tremble with both power and responsibility: tomorrow doesn't simply happen TO us like fate or accident, but is actively created BY us through the intention we hold today, right now, in this eternal present that is always just about to birth the next moment into being. We discover that we are not tiny powerless humans hoping the cosmos will be kind to us, but that we ARE the cosmos itself, the same intention that exploded the Big Bang into existence, the same creative force that spoke light into darkness, now localized in these human forms, wielding the power to focus universal consciousness into specific manifestation through the simple act of speaking our intention into the opening at our throats where thought becomes vibration, where potential becomes actual, where tomorrow is born from today's consciously chosen word. And we understand finally why throat chakra carries this teaching: because silent wishes remain in the ethereal realm of maybe and someday, but spoken intentions vibrate into physical reality, committing our whole being to what we claim, activating the creative power that ancient scriptures knew when they said "In the beginning was the Word" - not the thought, not the idea, but the WORD, the spoken intention that brings worlds into existence. Tomorrow, when millions gather in meditation and the stars align and the portal opens, we will not be begging the universe to save us or hoping some external force makes everything better; we will be the universe consciously choosing what to create with the massive energies available, aligning our individual intentions into coherent collective signal that focuses the neutral cosmic forces toward awakening rather than fear, toward unity rather than division, toward the tomorrow we intend rather than the tomorrow we unconsciously perpetuate. This is the shift from victim to creator, from passive hoping to active intending, from unconscious pattern-repeating to conscious world-building. We are the intention of the cosmos - not metaphor, not aspiration, but literal truth - and every word we speak, every focus we hold, every tomorrow we imagine is the universe stretching toward itself through us, aiming at its own evolution, creating the next moment of its infinite unfolding. Tomorrow depends on the intention we hold today, and today, we choose awakening.
