**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Throat
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Physical Week
- **Main Topic:** Smile and Laughter as Spiritual Activation
- **Vibration:** `Te`
- **Statement:** `I Am Manifested Truth`
- **Code:** Leo - within the safety of the mother's home, it is acknowledged the father's presence, who guides and leads. In the ancient vision, the lion was the one that commanded among the lions of the Savannah. And for that, his image creates the stars that are positioned high in the sky in that concrete period of the year. It's the time to set the law, drawing the path to follow. For this, Leo characterizes the soul on fire, the leadership, the one who guides the heart of the family, the group, or the nation, the one who sets the collective destiny.

## Overview

Today we continue in the Physical Week of Pisces, working with the Throat Chakra. Our topic is the smile and laughter—not as mere expressions of happiness, but as powerful tools for spiritual activation and expansion.

Today Matias shares his experience with the 144 in Egypt, where laughter became the key to activation, even when some criticized this approach as "not serious enough" for spiritual work.

---

## The Context: Working with the 144 in Egypt

### The Team

These past days, we have been working with the 144. They were helping to do the whole task. Doodat and Max were there, and Malaya is traveling right now, coming back to her country.

Doodat was helping in the smaller pyramid in Menkaure. Matias was in Khufu, and Malaya was in the center one. Max was going from one pyramid to the other, changing. It was impossible for Matias to do the whole thing alone because we were working with the three pyramids at the same time.

We have been laughing all these days. Because today was the day of the smile, the laughing, Matias decided to share a little bit together before they leave, because this is the last day that they are here.

## The Story of the 2018 Nile Trip

### Sharing the Work

Three years ago in 2018, Matias did a trip through the Nile with a lot of people. He decided to make videos to share with the people in the network what they were working with in every one of the temples, so everyone could know what they were working with.

Even though people know Matias because he remembers his past lives and all the things, the truth is that he usually forgets everything he does in the same day. He has not really good memory for the day.

So he was speaking about what they had done that day, in Spanish with Doodat and in English with Malaya, giving the explanations.

### Too Much Energy to Communicate Properly

One of the things that happened is that they had so much energy after the work they did in every temple that when the moment of communicating arrived, it was impossible to communicate properly. With anything, they were laughing.

They were laughing so much, laughing a lot all the time. Basically, they decided to maybe share that energy and not communication. They started to laugh the whole time, and Matias decided to share that vibration through laughter.

---

## The Criticism: Not Serious Enough

### People Got Mad

What happened was that a lot of people got mad and started to be annoying because they were laughing a lot. They said that it was not the good way of communicating, that they couldn't understand anything.

There were people that were mad because "that's not the way in which you should share things about spirituality—you should be much more serious, because things of the being and the consciousness must be from the center."

### Questioning the Approach

One of the things they kind of were thinking about is: maybe we are in a mistake. We have to think about it if we are doing it wrong. Maybe the connection with the spirit is much more about severity and being much more serious.

---

## The Masters' Answer: Laugh

### The Temple Experience

Even though they were thinking about maybe the connection with spirituality should be much more serious and maybe they were not doing it right, when they went to the temples, the masters that appeared there were very serious, very centered.

They said things really strange, not laughing and not smiling anything. But suddenly they just straight said: "Laugh."

And they started to laugh. Like, it's funny. They started to laugh.

### Understanding Laughter as Activation

In that moment, they understood—even if they were in the temple and the pyramid—that laughter was activation.

What they saw is that when they were doing the meditation, it was like aligning themselves in their center. And then the laughter was the one that helped them to expand this energy, like activating this energy.

One of the things that you can see through the experiences is that laughter is one of the greatest activations that you can have.

---

## The 11:11:11 Gathering

### The Powerful Command

Since that moment, Matias could understand why they were saying all these all the time—like, laugh or smile—as a part of the activation.

One of the most important sentences they have heard was in the 11:11:11:11 gathering in Argentina, when one of the beings in the moment of activation said: "Laugh, humans, laugh."

And everyone started to laugh—6,000 people were laughing out loud. And it was the activation. That was the activation.

### More Powerful Than Meditation

It was so powerful, much more powerful than when they were doing the meditation before.

This is why, from all these experiences, we can understand that the activation is not done by religious severity. It is done by spiritual laughter.

Laughter is our characteristic from the spiritual world because it's freedom, it's expression.

---

## The Message: Just Laugh

### Simple and Direct

So just—that is easy—just laugh, humans, laugh. And that's it.

The teaching is simple: laughter activates. Laughter expands. Laughter frees.

Spiritual work doesn't have to be serious, severe, controlled. It can be joyful, free, expansive.

## The Story of the Soul Who Comes Without Knowing Why

### The Call

Matias shares about one of the 144 people who in February 2020 were some friends with him, doing the opening of the "I Am" portal of time to begin all this.

The reason why they are here and help still, along with the rest that are in their houses and countries, is that they came to help do this because they were somehow connected through this project, this story.

Basically, they were discovering why they were here in that moment. Most of them started to remember why they were doing this together in that moment.

### The One Who Knew Least

But Matias thinks that the one who knew less of all was this particular person. Matias asked him after two years without speaking with him—he had no idea if he was alive or anything.

Matias just wrote to him and said, "Would you come to help me to open the doors of time for this new time, and we have to do this activation?"

And he said, "Yes."

Get a movie. But Matias didn't explain it. Matias didn't explain anything.

### "I Need You" - "From When?"

Matias wrote: "I need you."

And he said, "From when?"

But Matias never explained anything about why and where. Basically, Matias doesn't know where it is, but that's it.

He never knows why Matias called him. He never knows what—he never knows why Matias called him to come, but he comes anyway.

He suddenly appears and says, "So what?"

### The Soul Connection

He was important always that he is here somehow, but he has no way of knowing why intellectually.

Basically, the reason why he was important is because not this person, but the soul in this person.

Two thousand years ago, Matias and this soul made a pact: in order for Matias to begin this and do it properly, they should be together in front of the pyramids that day in February 2020.

He said yes, but he had no idea why they were in front of the pyramids. He was like, "Now what?"

### The Point: Trust

Matias has to thank him because to tell someone that his wife caused his death years ago, and that without him Matias could not open the records, the keys to do what he's doing now—and he comes, 100% open-eyed. "Yes, I'm here."

Really, it's two things. The more that thing was to laugh and to share this thing.

## Practice

### Preparation

Take a deep breath, and then release all the energy, shaking the body. Take a deep breath. Close your eyes. Sit comfortably. Concentrate on breathing.

### Caressing the Body

Softly, start to touch, massage, caress each part of your body from your feet still your head, becoming aware of each part of it.

Go through the feet, legs, genitals, hips, belly, chest, the back, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, face, and head.

### Massaging Face and Throat

Softly, start to massage from your ears, all the jaw, and then to the lips, the teeth, and going down to the neck.

Softly trace the lips, the jaw, and the neck. Recognize that in this part of your body, you can find your truth, your manifested truth.

### Connecting to Vocal Cords

Take a deep breath, bringing your attention to the vocal cords, the throat, and the tongue.

Become aware that this truth can radiate to the outside from the power that you have within, the sounding, the truth, connecting the out and the inside. It's only possible through your smile.

### Smile

Smile. Smile. Perceive the muscles of your face sending the signals for your brain to understand emotions. The brain sees pleasure and plenty to it.

Smile and perceive how this tiny action of the physical body aligns your soul and spirit.

### Smile at Everything

Smile. Observe in front of you your conflicts, sorrows, enemies, crises. And smile.

Observe in front of you your friends, your lovers, your family, your joy. And smile.

Smile as much as you can. Smile. Smile with the body, aligning this body, the soul, and the spirit. Smile wider.

### Smile at All Dimensions

For seeing all the beings that you are in every dimension, in time and space, and smile. For all of them are smiling back to you.

And we sound. Te. Smile. Smile. Smile. Smile.

## Integration

### Smile Practice

Today, smile as much as you can. Not fake smiling, but allowing your face to express lightness, joy, freedom.

Notice how it changes your internal state. Notice how the muscles send signals to your brain, creating pleasure and alignment.

### Laugh Freely

When you feel the urge to laugh, don't hold it back because it seems "inappropriate" or "not serious enough." Let it out.

Laughter is activation. Laughter is expansion. Laughter is freedom.

### Stop Taking Spirituality So Seriously

If you've been approaching spiritual work with severity, control, and seriousness, notice this pattern today.

Can you lighten up? Can you allow joy? Can you trust that laughter is just as sacred as silence?

## Q&A

### Q: Isn't spiritual work supposed to be serious and disciplined?

Meditation and alignment, yes—those create the center. But activation and expansion come through joy, laughter, freedom. Both are needed. Don't confuse severity with sacredness.

### Q: How can laughter activate more than meditation?

Meditation aligns you to your center. Laughter expands that aligned energy outward, activating it, broadcasting it. You need both: center first, then expansion.

### Q: What if I don't feel like smiling?

Start anyway. The muscles of your face send signals to your brain. Even a "fake" smile triggers the brain to release pleasure chemicals, which then create real joy. The body leads the emotions.

### Q: Why did people get mad at you for laughing in the temples?

Because they have a belief that spiritual work must be serious, controlled, severe. They confused discipline with restriction. Real spirituality is freedom.

### Q: What was the 11:11:11:11 gathering?

A massive gathering of 6,000 people in Argentina where, in the moment of activation, a being commanded everyone to laugh. The laughter of 6,000 people created a more powerful activation than all the meditation that came before.

### Q: Why doesn't your friend know why he came to Egypt?

Because his soul knows, even if his mind doesn't. Two thousand years ago, a pact was made. His soul answered the call. Trust matters more than understanding.

### Q: How do I know when to use laughter vs. meditation?

Meditate to align to center. Laugh to expand and activate. Meditate to ground. Laugh to broadcast. Both are sacred. Both are necessary.
