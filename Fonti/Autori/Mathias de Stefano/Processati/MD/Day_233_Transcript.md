## Introduction

Oh , I. . You get me Ok Hi everyone , morning We 're afternoon Could be wound Yeah , that 's what I 'm doing. Yes , I 'm doing.

Last time.

Today they were like , , , , no. I , , no. I 'm not going to do it. I 'm going to do it.

The reason why we are here so positive is because in the CR we were all negative.

## Q&A

So , that 's the , that 's the , that 's the , that 's the , that 's the , that 's the , that 's the , , , today 's the day of the smile and I wanted to share it to you with you this laughing because we were , we were laughing all day , , we were laughing all day. And , , and we do n't even know why because we even forget the things that we say. The , the thing that I wanted to share also is because these past days , we have been working with a hundred and forty-four and they were helping me to , to do the whole task. Of course , due date and max were there and , , Malay , Malay is , is traveling right now , coming back to her country.

, and , , and due date was helping me in the smaller pyramid in Miquininos. I was in cubes and Malay was in the center one and , , and Max was going from one pyramid to the other. , changing. , , because it was impossible for me to do the whole thing.

, because we were working with the three pyramids at the same time.

So , of course , that , , , we have been laughing all these days , but , , because today was the smile , the laughing.

So I decided to , , to share a little bit together before they leave because this is the last day. That , that they are here.

So , , three years ago in 2018 , we did a trip in , , I do n't know say , and I , and through the Nile , came a sick with a lot of people. And , , , and I decided to make these videos to share with the people in the , in the , in the , in the network. What , we were working with in every one of the , of the temples. , so everyone could know , , what we were working with.

And , , and we , and I decided to , to share this. And even if you know me because I remember my past lives and all the things , , the , the truth is that I usually forget everything that I do in the same day.

So I have not really good memory for , , for the day. , so , so I was speaking about what we have done that day with , in Spanish with , Did it and with Malaya , we were speaking in , in English , yes. , so that , that was the , the explanations that that I did. , so one of the , of the things that happened is that we had so much energy after , , after the energy , after the , the word that we did , , in that , , in every temple.

That when the moment of communicating arrived , it was impossible to communicate properly because , with anything we were laughing. Like , we were laughing so much , so much and we were laughing a lot all the time.

So , , so basically , , , we decided to maybe share that energy and not , not communication.

So we started to laugh on that whole time and I decided to , to share that vibration through laughter.

Okay.

So what happened that a lot of people got mad and they started to be , , , , , , , annoying. Yeah , annoying because we were laughing a lot. And , , because they said that it was , it was not the good way of communicating that we could n't understand anything. They were , , , , people that were mad because , , that 's not the way we , in , in , in which you should share things about a spirituality that you should be much more serious because things of the being and the consciousness must be , , from the center.

And so , so one of the things that we kind of were thinking about is maybe we are , in a mistake. We have to think about it if we are doing it wrong. Maybe this may be the connection with the spirit is much more about seventy and , I do n't know , being much more serious.

So one of the , of the things that , , happened when we asked this was like , we , , even though we were thinking about maybe the connection with the spirituality should be much more serious and we are no. We are not doing it right. , when we went to the temples , the masters that appear there , , they were very serious , very , like , center. And they said , like , , I do n't know what to say.

They said that , , the things really strange and not lacking and not smiling anything , but suddenly they just straight , said , , laugh. And we started to laugh , like , it 's funny. I do n't know , we started to laugh. And , , and the thing was that in that moment , we understood even if we were in the temple and the pyramid , we understood that laugh was activation.

## Guided Meditation

So what we saw is that when we were doing the meditation , it was like , aligning ourselves in our center and then the laughter was the one that helped us to expand this energy , like , activating this energy. One of the things that you can , , see through the experiences that laughter is one of the greatest activation that you can have.

So since that moment or well , from I could understand what why they were saying all these all the time , like , laugh or smile , like a part of the activation. And , , so , , , one of the most important sentences that we have heard was in the 11 , 11 , 11 , 11 gathering in our antenna when one of the beings in the moment of activation said , not that. Said , , laugh humans laugh. And , and everyone started to laugh and 6,000 people , we were laughing out loud and it was , the activation.

That was the activation. It was so powerful , much more powerful than when we were doing the meditation before.

So this is why from all this , , , experiences , we can understand that the activation is not done by the religious sovereignty , is done by the spiritual laughter. , laughter is our characteristics from the , , spiritual world because it 's freedom is expression.

So just , that is easy , just laugh humans laugh. And that 's it. I go in class. He would translate in English.

I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry.

## Energy Work

I do n't know how to use the platform. You say , do you have automatic subtitles that I have n't , I do n't have , I , any clue of how to work. They are , , one of the , of the 14 people that in February , 2020 , where he would be some friends with me , , doing this opening of the I am , , the portal of time to begin with all this. And the reason why they are here and help me still , and the rest that are in the houses , and the countries , , they are , they , , they came to help me to do this because we were somehow connected through this , , through this , , how to say this , , project this story and so on.

## Q&A

, and basically , we , , we were discovering why we were here in that moment , , most of it , we started to remember why we were doing this together in that moment. But I think that the one that knew less of all was him , , I asked him after two years without speaking with him. I had no idea if he was alive or anything.

So I just wrote to him and he said , would you come to help me to open the , the doors of time , for this new time and this , again , and we have to do this activation. And I said , no , just open the doors of time and , and he said , yes , get a movie , he 's good. No , I did n't explain it. I did n't explain it.

I did n't explain it.

So I wrote , I wrote him , I need you. And he said , from when?

So , but I never explained him anything about why and where. Basically , I do n't know where it is , but that 's it. Oh , that he never knows why I called him. He never knows what he never knows why I called him to come , but he comes anyway.

So he suddenly appears and say , so what? Anyway , , but he was important always that he is here somehow , but he has no way.

So , , so basically the reason is because the reason why he was important is because , , not this person , that this person , the soul in this person.

So that 's it. That 's it. That 's it. This shows up on the top.

The top. , , the soul is inside of the game. , we did a part 2,000 years ago that in order for me to begin this and do it properly , we were , we should have , we should be together in front of the things that day and February 2020.

So , , so he said , yes , but he had no idea why we were in front of the things and he was like , no , what? And now what? It 's like , so basically , basically , I have to thank him because , , to tell someone that , that , , I was , he 's caused his wife in so fast in the years ago , and that without him , I could not open the , the , the records that were just , the things to do what I 'm doing now , and he comes and 100 % open size. Yes , I 'm here.

So , really , it 's two things.

So , of course , yes. The more that thing was to laugh and to share this thing. , give me a cup of tea. I have a cup of tea.

So , , so I kind of move. I think , okay. And whoever wants information , you can read the post for today. Let 's go to the information for today.

## Daily Practice Elements

Hmm? The vibration for today is day. The statement for today is , I am manifested truth. Leo.

And within the safety of the mother 's home , it is acknowledged the father 's presence , who guides and leads. In the ancient vision , the lion was the one that commanded among the lines of the Saban. And for that , his image , the creates the stars that positional high in the sky in that concrete period of the year. It 's the time to set the law of drawing the path to follow.

For this Leo , characterize the soul on fire. The leadership , the one who guides the heart of the family , the group , or the nation , the one who sets the collective destiny. And so for those who , maybe wonder about the story that I 've been saying , that I just pointed a few things. For sure , you have , I wrote about this entire history of the encounter of the people from other lives and meeting Max and all that from that time.

I wrote it in a novel that is not finished yet , but is most of the chapters are in a novel that I wrote name like Rent Index , the great heritage. That is in the R3N campus.

So it 's not in English yet , but eventually someday , maybe it will. Let 's go to the lines. We take deep breath , and then we release all the energy shaking the body. Take a deep breath , close your eyes , see the comfortable table.

I concentrate on everything. I 'm going to take a deep breath , and then I 'll take a deep breath. I 'm going to take a deep breath , and then I 'll take a deep breath. Monthly , I started to touch massage.

Care is , each part of my body from my feet , still my head , becoming aware of each part of it. I go through the feet , legs , genitals , hips , belly , chest , the back , hands , arms , shoulders. Next , face , and head. And softly , I start to massage from my ears , all the jaw.

And then to the lips , the teeth , and going down to the neck.

Softly , I trace the lips , the jaw , and the neck. And I recognize that in this part of my body , I can find my truth , my manifested truth. And take a deep breath , bring in my attention to the vocal cords , the fear out , and the tongue. And I become aware that this truth ca n't radiate to the outside , from the power that I have within the sounding , the truth , connecting the out on the inside.

It 's only possible to my smile. Smile. Smile , and perceive the muscles of your face , sending the signals for your brain to understand emotions , the brain see pleasure , and plenty to it. Smile , and perceive how this tiny action of the physical body aligns your soul and spirit.

Smile. Observer the front of you , your conflicts , sorrow , enemies , prices , and smile. Observer in front of you , your friends , your lovers. Your family , your joy , and smile.

Smile as much as you can. Smile. Smile with the body , aligning this body , the soul and the spirit. Smile wider.

For seeing all the beings that you are in every dimension to time and space , and smile. For all of them are smiling back to you , and we sound. Smile. Smile.

Smile. Smile. Smile. Smile.
