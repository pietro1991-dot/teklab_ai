## Introduction

Good morning , left in an ingredient. How are you?

Today , the alignment may speaking. One would be the best because I am kind of cold.

So I want to be very , very probably.

So I am doing my own purge process going to the depth.

So that 's how it is. This is happening constantly. This is the year where I got ill the most because I am usually traveling constantly going around all the time. And I have no time for getting ill to be myself still in place.

So basically what I am doing with this huge process of going in and to purge in my own self and so on is by staying is getting ill because I am cleaning myself constantly. I am staying still here.

So I am purging constantly.

So I accepted this is good. It 's fine. I am just cleaning myself.

So I guess the whole year would be like this. But again , I guess I needed. Just another thing. To remind you that usually when we do this kind of things is to we refer with the concept of perfection.

We have to be perfect and the person that teaches or whatever has to have everything already done and no , it 's not like this. We are here working ourselves together. We are working with our inner aspects and we are all doing that all together.

So we are not here to expect for perfection. We are here. We are not here to seek for alignment and perfection. We are here to make the process to understand ourselves to know how to work with ourselves.

So we are like this. Right now.

So I am speaking about perfection.

We are going to talk about the topic related to the throw chara for today which is conflict. And it 's kind of related to the pursuit of perfection. We humans from nature. We look for conflict.

It 's something like very , very normal for us. We look for conflict everywhere. Like in every aspect of our realities. And the reason is why exactly the same of why we related with the throw chara.

The throw chara is related to the throw chara related with the process of learning education.

So I simulate an information to express an information.

So conflict is one of those tools that we use in our life to learn.

So that 's why it 's related with the throw. We use conflict to learn.

So first of all , let 's try to remember what conflict means. Conflict comes from the Latin word con that means with or the conjunction of many things. And fire that means to heat to knock. And when you heat when you knock something is from one direction.

But when you have a conjunction of heating process , knocking , you are suppressed. You are under stress.

Okay , stress means to be under a lot of pressure. To be pulled by a lot of forces.

So when you are knocked by many. When you are knocked by many directions from many points.

So you are under stress.

So that 's why the conflict basically means to be under the pressure of many things.

So let 's remember what we have spoken yesterday. That a person being something that is under pressure activates its potential.

So we are like seeds under the pressure of the earth. And by the pressure of the earth , the seed explodes and go up looking for the sun growing. We have to understand that in nature everything that we see that is beautiful. Everything that for us is like wonderful like a crystal , like a flower.

Like , yeah , all the beauty that we can see ourselves. Everything that we contemplate in nature like the most beautiful thing. It was all born because of the pressure , the pressure of the artman , the pressure of the tectonic plateaus , the pressure of the ground of the rocks. And the pressure of the pressure of the gas is all that press.

Basically is born because of the pressure. And of course , everything that we have accomplished in our life , that we say , wow , as humanity , this is beautiful. When humans had accomplished , it was because of the pressure.

So basically one of the things that happened in nature is that most of the organic and inner organic beings , like crystals , like animals , we have all to solve conflicts.

So these are the pressure and the heating and knocking process that we receive when we are trying to express ourselves. As seed has the conflict of the soil over it. A crystal has the conflict to solve the heat of the magma. Animals have the conflict of winter , so they have to survive in that winter.

So basically everything in nature is pressure , it 's a pressure that creates a conflict that we need to solve.

So it 's about to awake the potential that we have within to overcome that conflict.

So this is why we use conflict because conflict is a tool for evolution. Is a tool that helps us to move forward , to evolve , to develop the tools that we have within.

Okay? To recognize what we can do for ourselves , that would be. This is why humans mostly look for conflict because when you feel that you are trapped and you can move in something , so the strength within you is trying to look for that conflict.

So it can move forward and to open path , open away to keep going. Conflict basically is one of the greatest keys for the growth and the development.

So now we are going to see the two different types of conflict that we can have in our lives. The conflict through the unconscious and the conflict through the conscious.

So we have to understand that unconscious would mean the movement of two different aspects , two different currents that nature has created in order to develop , which would be a positive and a negative currents.

Okay , the whole universe is based in those two movements of energy.

Okay?

So everything is created because of that.

So everyone is pushed because of these two currents. From the beginning , from the main point of view , the positive and the negative. Imagine that we have the positive , sorry , the positive , which is the below and the negative above.

Okay , here.

So when this energy and this one are here separated.

So there is something in the universe that makes pressure and press these two energies until they touch , but they move in different aspects.

So when these two different energies touch , they are trying to find the balance again. One going up and the other one going down.

So to create that , they start to make this spinning movement , creating the balance.

So the cold can go up and the heat can go down again.

Sorry , so the heat can go up and the cold can go down , like try to balance the things.

So when they start to move like this , they create this shape of the spiral that in spirituality would call the Kundalini energy.

Okay , so the Kundalini starts to move these two patterns that were pressed once each other.

So we also have some stand-out conflict means we also have the cold air and the hot air in the atmosphere.

So when we have low pressure in the atmosphere , it means that the atmosphere is going down.

So it press the cold and the hot currents , okay.

So when they touch , they try to organize themselves again and the way they do it is by spiral.

So they create a tornado , they create a hurricane. This movement is basically to put order into two different energies that are being suppressed once each other. Why we call it conflict? Because it 's the heat of two different energies creating cows around , but this cows is to bring order.

## Guided Meditation

So when we have a tornado a hurricane , we see the softer it creates around , it creates a mess around. But it balanced the atmosphere so we can breathe basically , okay.

So what we believe is a conflict is really the solution so it could breathe. And in the other way , when we have the Kundalini activated , that would be the moment where we have this crisis in our life that everything changes and we do n't know what to do because everything.

Now it 's very different from what we were used to. This means that conflict , conflicts are created. When something from the outside is pressing constantly against us , putting together the two different energies.

So the conflict is the feeling of how the energy is trying to organize itself again to find balance.

Now we can understand that we usually think of conflict like something negative , but for nature conflict is the tool that we have to understand that we are trying to reorganize ourselves into a different way.

Now we can understand that the conflict was never the problem. What is really the problem is if these two currents are conscious or unconscious.

So let 's take this example. Let 's go to the very beginning of humanity. Let 's go to the first humans in the caves in Africa. Thousands of thousands and thousands of thousands of years ago.

If the first homicide would n't have the conflict of the change of weather , if they would n't have experienced the draw. Because of the change of weather. We still would be there in Africa living like the gorilla.

So just when we tried to speak about the conflicts to understand the conflict , we have to understand that if there would n't have been , if we would n't have had the conflict after the draw in Africa that time , nobody would have thought ever to live the place. Nobody would have understood how to create a tool , how to saw how to build , how to be sedentary , how to be in the moment , how to create houses , to create a lot of culture. We would n't be here. Without conflicts , we would n't be here.

Without conflicts. We would neither have diversity in plants. It 's impossible to have so many animals. It 's nothing.

It would have been always the same.

So this is why we have to understand that nature uses conflict as an evolutionary tool.

So how can I use the conflict in a conscious way?

So it could be something that helps me to evolve. Instead of just taking me in this clarity constantly , once again , repeating the cycle the same. Well , the way is basically to find a third way. And the third way is born by the other two.

This means that you take the polarity , positive and negative , to create a third solution , not one again.

Okay?

So you create a third solution. And here 's the easy example. To understand how this works , how this duality works , how the unconscious works. Let 's take the example of the seed that is under the soil , the ground here.

Imagine that the seed that is below the earth says , The conflict that I have in my life is the earth that is putting its weight on me. Everyone that is up the earth is just putting all its pressure on my body. And I can not find the light. I can not go out to find the light.

And this is because of the earth.

So the seed is saying the only guilty , that the only guilty that is banning me from the light is earth. Because earth is not allowed to go up to rice to grow as I should be.

So the seed says , so the earth is the earth. We have to get rid of the earth so we could go to the light.

Okay? Basically it 's like that. And you start to say that the conflict that you have as a seed , the conflict you have. The conflict you have is basically earth.

Because that 's polarized. You believe you 're in negative. The other one is the positive or the other one is the negative and you 're in the positive. And you have the conflict and you have to fight against the earth.

So you can open and see the light behind. Is n't that how human think is basically duality? It 's basically believing that there is someone that is expressing us and then we are depressed. It 's duality.

So for the seed , the conflict is the soil. And for the soil , the conflict is the seeds of occupying as a paste that they do n't use. This is why we have in our realities when we say those are the bad people. And of course I am the good one.

So I am the good people. I am the good one.

So I am right. And all of them we have to take them away because they are the oppressors. They are the ones that are taking us control in us and you say we are the good ones. We have the power to the people.

We have to be the ones to take power. I 'm not a bad one because they are the bad ones. And suddenly you will realize that by a lot of polarity in the universe , if you believe constantly that you are the positive.

So you will need constantly and negative to balance that.

So every time that you say I am right and the other one is wrong , what you are just doing is to creating constantly the opposite because you need it in order to be yourself the positive.

So you could recognize yourself as positive. You will need constantly and negative. You understand why I mean so this will be constant. This is polarity.

You create constantly this system. And this is something that I hear from people sometimes that we have to get out from the system of the system of duality. But the way in which people say this is like if the system of duality is created by someone in the outside. You know , it 's like they are creating the duality and we are the ones that want be dual.

And by just saying that you are being the system of duality because you are believing that is someone that is creating it against you.

So you are duality.

So what would be the third option? Does someone knows what is the third option of the seed? The third option of the seed? It 's very easy.

It 's very easy. The answer is very easy.

## Energy Work

So the third option would be very easy. The third option of the seed is to create roots. That 's it. Very simple.

Roots. The roots of the seed expand in the ground and it grabs the soil , the earth to take to be stabilized , to have power. And uses the nutrients of the soil to grow up.

So the same system that press the seed is used by the seed as a third option to go up.

Okay?

So the seed is basically using the oppression to be stronger. Imagine the seed being against the earth. This is absurd. That 's important.

So the plants understood a third option. The third option is to create roots. For sure you have heard about the concept of humans being star seeds or we being seeds , light seeds. But we have this problem being this seed that usually humans that we believe we are seeds.

We want to fly but never create roots because we do n't want to create roots in the creation of our own self. We created this system.

So we have to go down in order to have flowers and define alignment. Basically this is why we have to go down to face our conflicts , the darkness. To find the power that we have here in the ground. And when we go down there the conflict is the one teaching you how to find a third option.

The third option is the one that helps you to evolve. And the conflict is the one telling you you need a third option. It 's like mom and dad have it a kid. If mom and dad does n't have a kid there is no evolution.

Imagine mom and dad never have an a kid and live in a eternally both of them. Just there wo n't be anyone. Simply like that. Basically this is why I spoke about the energy states yesterday.

Because they have in this election and we will talk about what democracy is. There is no country in the world right now that has democracy. The democracy is a totally different system and there is no country that applies democracy right now in the world. The democracy was only applied during the short period of time in Greece long time ago.

And nobody used it again. Nobody. There is no country with democracy right now. But the states is probably one of the less democratic countries in the world with China , Russia and other countries like North Korea and the country.

And basically how this system works. Like this is like voting in between the seat or the soil. But would you vote? The soil is saying no.

The problem is the seed. The seed is saying no. The problem is the soil. And the soil says the best is the soil and the seed is the best is the seed.

But there is no plan growing there. Nothing. There is just pump pump pump pump.

So that is what I want to say. We have to find a third option. This is why in our reality we have to think about a third option. We have to think about a different option to work with.

Because imagine if tomorrow I say , okay , I will run for president. Imagine that. And you all are able to vote for me. And I will screw it up anyway.

Because it is the system that does n't work. It 's not about a person. It 's not about having a president or a better president in which we say , oh , he will solve it. No , that 's precisely the problem.

We have to look for a third option. A different one. For it , third thing to exist , we need the energy of soil and the seed. And this is because the only way you can create a flower or a fruit.

Something different , something you is if the soil and the seed work together.

So this is how we can , we have to understand that in our own lives and in the whole society and the world. Conflicts are just there to show us that we have to look for the third option in order to evolve. Let 's go to the information for today. The information for today is me.

## Daily Practice Elements

The statement for today is I am the extension of the creator voice. The code for today is attraction. This universe a law implies that knowing my ability as co-creator , I can return my vibration so that what I want finds me. For it to find the same tuning as magnet.

With the law of polarity , correspondence and vibration , I can attract to myself everything I want and everything I do n't want. But nothing will remain for the key of vibration is constant change. And if I , today , we express the desire to use the conflict as a tool for our own evolution. I have a conflict , let 's go to it.

So let 's say to come for trouble. Just another option and another thing to tell you. Because of all these things that we have been talking these days. Yes , they are about these politicians and politicians and all these things.

One of the things that I saw is that a lot of people say when it is going to be the system , how can we apply these tools and those things to the system? Because everyone wants to change now. Everyone wants to change in this moment.

So a few people would say , what is the use of doing all these spiritual things every day? We have to act , we have to do the things , we have to change the world and blah blah blah. And the thing is that remember the law of correspondence , the law of correspondence says that everything that is outside is a projection from the inside.

## Q&A

So if you do n't work with yourself inside , it does n't matter if the system that we will do in the future will be the best one. We will do a mess because if we are a mess inside , we are not going to be able to create a coherent system. We are asking for coherent politicians. But in order for a coherent politician to exist , we have to become coherent citizens.

So take all the teachings , all the things that we are trying to do now as a practice to be coherent citizen for the future. If you change within is the only way you can change the outside.

So this is the preparation to become a responsible and aware citizen for the future.

Okay , do n't take it as spiritual path. Take it as your preparation to be a citizen. We begin by moving our shoulders and circles. Very softly.

We will relax and let all the weight of my body fall down. Try to focus only in your breathing. We will relax and relax. As I agree , I become aware of the life around you.

And how this life penetrate the nice skin.

We are going to do my muscles and our breathing. I perceive the slight inside and outside myself. Until I perceive myself completely as light , irateating towards every direction. I am , I am , I am , I am my entire self , the sending to my body.

## Energy Work

I go through my crown to eye , throat , heart , flees , scrum , root , veins and ankles. I am the light of the eye , the sending to the depth , to the pressure of my body. Take a deep breath and the sand through the feet to the ground. Going through all the layers of the soil , roots , stones and rocks across , or heavy faster to the macro towards the darkness of the core of the planet.

I embrace. I embrace. I embrace. I am the expansion of the Creator of the voice.

I am the expansion of the Creator of the voice. In depression of various iraconmerism , I am the sign to use my confidence as a tool for my evolution. I am the constant. Give your conflicts to me , so I can show you how to use them.

Only the creators from darkness know how to use the confidence from the shadows. I wait here for your offers , so I can give it to you by dreams as a gift. I am here comes the time where you will have to trust in the shadow of one 's for your roots , expand in our territories. We are not your conflict.

We have only become that for you , because you think that we are your enemies. Change yourself. We will also change for you for you , for you , army and I am here. In the dreams and nightmares , you will find that this time , do n't run away.

Turn back to me , watch , straighten to my eyes. For this is the time towards the light together. And there you will acknowledge that only conflict is only limit in the universe. Welcome to your own shadows.

Take a deep breath. And begin to expand the light of your subconscious towards the conscience. By moving softly and crazy your body. By beginning to stretch to your own and open your eyes.

One of the things that was trying to say to us is that the only ones that create the conflicts and our limitations is ourselves.

So what he said was that before we go to sleep as an offer , we give our conflict. What is our conflict? Think about what is your belief in your life. You go to sleep , think about it.

And the only reason why they are kind of the enemies is because we think the darkness is the enemy. We just change our perception of them. They are not anymore our enemies. We are trying to get a little water and think about this conflict when you go to sleep and rest.

See you tomorrow for the heart and same time.
