# Day 93 - Conflict: The Tool for Evolution

**Author:** Matias de Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days - The Path of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Throat Chakra
- **Week Theme:** Mental Week of Scorpio
- **Main Topic:** Conflict as Evolutionary Tool
- **Vibration:** `MO`
- **Statement:** `I am the extension of the creator voice`
- **Code:** Attraction - This universal law implies that knowing my ability as co-creator, I can retune my vibration so that what I want finds me, for it finds the same tuning as magnet. With the law of polarity, correspondence and vibration, I can attract to myself everything I want and everything I don't want. But nothing will remain, for the key of vibration is constant change.

## Overview

The personal purging process continues intensely - illness, congestion, constant inner work. This isn't unusual; it's part of staying still for the first time in years, allowing deep cleaning to occur. Traveling constantly previously left no time for getting sick, no time to be still and purge. Now, rooted in one place, the purging happens constantly.

This is important to understand: perfection is not the goal. We're not here expecting teachers to have everything already solved. We're all working ourselves together, working with our inner aspects all together. We're not here to seek alignment and perfection - we're here to make the process, to understand ourselves, to know how to work with ourselves.

Today's teaching on conflict addresses a fundamental misunderstanding: we think conflict is the problem. Actually, conflict is one of the greatest tools for evolution. Nature uses conflict (pressure creating stress from many directions) to activate potential in all beings. The issue isn't conflict itself but whether we approach it consciously or unconsciously.

## Core Teaching

### What Conflict Actually Means

"Conflict" comes from Latin: "con" (with, or conjunction of many things) + "fligere" (to strike, to knock). When you strike something from one direction, that's one impact. When you have conjunction of striking processes - knocked from many directions simultaneously - you are compressed under stress.

Stress means to be under a lot of pressure, pulled by a lot of forces. When knocked by many directions from many points, you are under stress. Conflict basically means to be under the pressure of many things.

Remember yesterday's teaching: a seed being something under pressure activates its potential. We are like seeds under earth's pressure. By earth's pressure, the seed explodes and goes up looking for sun, growing.

### Everything Beautiful Comes from Pressure

In nature, everything we see that is beautiful - everything we contemplate as wonderful (crystals, flowers, all nature's beauty) - was born because of pressure. Pressure of atmosphere, pressure of tectonic plates, pressure of ground, rocks, gases. All that pressure creates what we find beautiful.

Everything humanity has accomplished that we call beautiful came because of pressure. This is foundational: most organic and inorganic beings (crystals, animals, all of us) solve conflicts to exist.

**Examples of natural conflict:**
- Seeds have the conflict of soil over them
- Crystals have the conflict solving magma's heat
- Animals have the conflict of winter - they must survive that winter

Basically everything in nature is pressure creating conflict we need to solve. It's about awakening the potential within to overcome that conflict.

**This is why we use conflict - conflict is a tool for evolution.**

### Conflict as Evolutionary Tool

Conflict is a tool helping us move forward, to evolve, to develop the tools we have within. It helps us recognize what we can do for ourselves.

Humans mostly look for conflict because when you feel trapped and can't move, the strength within tries to look for that conflict so it can move forward, open a path, keep going.

Conflict basically is one of the greatest keys for growth and development. When we have conflict, it's pressure showing us: you need to activate different potential now.

### Two Types of Conflict: Unconscious and Conscious

We need to see the two different types of conflict - through unconscious and through conscious.

**Unconscious conflict** is the movement of two different aspects nature created for development: positive and negative currents. The whole universe is based on these two energy movements. Everything is created because of that. Everyone is pushed because of these two currents.

Imagine positive current below, negative current above, separated. When something in the universe presses these two energies until they touch (moving in different aspects), they try finding balance again - one going up, the other going down.

To create that balance, they start spinning, creating spiral shape. In spirituality we call this **Kundalini energy** - the two patterns pressed against each other organizing themselves through spiral movement.

**Real-world example:** We have cold air and hot air in atmosphere. When we have low atmospheric pressure, the atmosphere goes down, pressing the cold and hot currents together. When they touch, they try organizing themselves again. The way they do it: spiral. They create tornado, hurricane.

This movement puts order into two different energies being compressed against each other. We call it conflict because it's striking of two different energies creating chaos around. But this chaos BRINGS order. It balances the atmosphere so we can breathe.

What we believe is conflict is really the SOLUTION so we can breathe.

### Kundalini: Personal Atmospheric Balance

Similarly, when Kundalini activates, that's the moment of crisis in our life where everything changes and we don't know what to do because everything is different from what we were used to.

Conflict is created when something from outside constantly presses against us, putting together two different energies. The conflict is the feeling of how energy tries organizing itself again to find balance.

**The conflict was never the problem.** What's really the problem is if these two currents are conscious or unconscious.

### The Seed's Three Options: Finding the Third Way

To understand conscious vs unconscious conflict, examine the seed under soil metaphor deeply.

The seed under ground says: "The conflict I have in my life is the earth putting its weight on me. Everyone above earth is putting pressure on my body. I cannot find light, cannot go out to find light. This is because of earth. The only guilty one banning me from light is earth - earth is not allowing me to rise, to grow as I should be."

So the seed says: "Earth is the enemy. We have to get rid of earth so I can go to light."

This is POLARITY. You believe you're on one side (negative/positive), the other is opposite (positive/negative), and you have the conflict. You have to fight against earth so you can open up and see light behind.

**Isn't this how humans think?** Basically duality - believing something outside is oppressing me, and I am oppressed. It's duality.

For the seed, the conflict is soil. For the soil, the conflict is seeds occupying space they don't use. This is why we have in our realities: "Those are the bad people, and I am the good one." Or "I am the good people, those are bad. I am right. All of them we have to take away because they are oppressors, they control us. We are the good ones. Power to the people! We have to be the ones to take power."

Then suddenly you realize: by law of polarity in the universe, if you constantly believe you are positive, you will constantly NEED the negative to balance that. Every time you say "I am right and the other is wrong," what you're doing is creating constantly the opposite because you NEED it in order to be yourself the positive.

To recognize yourself as positive, you will need constantly a negative. **This creates constant system.** This is polarity.

You create the duality system constantly. This is something people say: "We have to get out from the system of duality." But the way people say this is like the system of duality is created by someone outside. No - YOU ARE the system of duality by believing someone outside is creating it against you. By just saying that, you ARE duality.

**So what would be the third option for the seed?**

The answer is very simple, very easy:

**THE SEED CREATES ROOTS.**

That's it. Very simple.

### The Third Option: Roots

The roots of the seed expand in the ground and grab the soil to be stabilized, to have power. They use the nutrients of the soil to grow up.

**The same system that presses the seed is USED by the seed as a third option to go up.**

The seed uses the oppression to be stronger. Imagine the seed being AGAINST the earth - this is absurd, impossible.

The plants understood a third option. The third option is to create roots.

### Humans as Seeds: The Root Problem

You've probably heard the concept of humans being star seeds or light seeds. But we who believe we are seeds want to FLY but never create roots because we don't want to create roots in the creation of our own self.

WE created this system. So we have to go down in order to have flowers and find alignment.

This is why we have to go down to face our conflicts, the darkness - to find the power we have here in the ground. When we go down there, the conflict is the one teaching you how to find a third option.

**The third option is the one that helps you evolve.** And the conflict is the one telling you: you need a third option.

### Creating the Third Option

It's like mom and dad having a kid. If mom and dad doesn't have a kid and they live eternally just both of them, there won't be anyone - simply like that.

This is why yesterday we spoke about energy states. When we have elections, we will talk about what democracy is. (Critical point: there is NO country in the world right now that has democracy. Democracy was only applied during a short period in Greece long ago. Nobody used it again. The United States is probably one of the LEAST democratic countries in the world, along with China, Russia, North Korea.)

How the current system works is like voting between the seed or the soil. Who would you vote for? Soil says "No, the problem is the seed." Seed says "No, the problem is the soil." Soil says "The best is soil." Seed says "The best is seed."

But there's no plant growing there. Nothing. Just pump-pump-pump-pump.

**We have to find a third option.** We have to think about a different option to work with.

Imagine tomorrow I say "Okay, I will run for president." Imagine that. And you can all vote for me. I will screw it up anyway because **it's the SYSTEM that doesn't work - it's not about a person.**

It's not about having a president or better president where we say "Oh, he will solve it." No, that's precisely the problem.

**We have to look for a third option, a different one.**

For a third thing to exist, we need the energy of soil AND seed. Because the only way you can create a flower or fruit - something different, something new - is if soil and seed work TOGETHER.

This is how we have to understand our own lives and the whole society, the world. **Conflicts are just there to show us we have to look for the third option in order to evolve.**

### The Law of Correspondence: Inner Reflects Outer

Remember the law of correspondence: everything outside is a projection from inside. If you don't work with yourself inside, it doesn't matter if the future system we create is the best one - we will make a mess because if we are a mess inside, we're not going to be able to create a coherent system.

We're asking for coherent politicians. But in order for a coherent politician to exist, we have to become **coherent citizens.**

**Take all teachings, all things we're trying to do now as practice to be coherent citizens for the future.** If you change within, that's the only way you can change outside.

This is the preparation to become a responsible and aware citizen. Don't take it as spiritual path - take it as your preparation to be a citizen.

### Before Sleep Tonight

Think about your conflicts when you go to sleep. Give your conflicts to the subconscious as offering. The only ones creating conflicts and our limitations are ourselves.

The darkness said: "Before we go to sleep as an offering, we give our conflict. What is our conflict? Think about what is your belief in your life."

The only reason why they are kind of enemies is because we think darkness is the enemy. Just change our perception of them - they are not anymore our enemies.

## Practice

### Preparation

Begin by moving shoulders in circles, very softly. Relax and let all weight of body fall down. Try to focus only on breathing. Relax deeper.

As you breathe, become aware of light around you and how this light penetrates inside skin. Perceive light inside and outside myself until perceiving myself completely as light, radiating toward every direction.

"I am, I am, I am my entire self, descending to my body."

### Journey to Core

Go through crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacrum, root, knees, ankles. "I am the light of the I Am, descending to the depth, to the pressure of my body."

Take deep breath and descend through feet to ground, going through all layers: soil, roots, stones, rocks, across crust, faster to magma toward darkness of planet's core.

"I embrace. I embrace. I embrace."

### Statement and Offering

**"I am the expansion of the Creator voice. I am the expansion of the Creator voice."**

"In expression of various I become, I am designed to use my conflicts as a tool for my evolution. I am the constant."

**Message from Darkness:**

"Give your conflicts to me, so I can show you how to use them. Only the creators from darkness know how to use the conflicts from the shadows. I wait here for your offerings, so I can give it to you by dreams as a gift.

I am here. Now comes the time where you will have to trust in the shadow. Once for your roots expand in our territories, we are not your conflict. We have only become that for you because you think that we are your enemies.

Change yourself - we will also change for you. For you, for you, you and I, we are here in the dreams and nightmares. You will find us this time. Don't run away. Turn back to me. Watch straight into my eyes. For this is the time towards the light together. And there you will acknowledge that only conflict is only limit in the universe.

Welcome to your own shadows."

### Integration

Take deep breath and begin to expand light of your subconscious towards conscience by moving softly and gently your body. Beginning to stretch on your own. Open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Before sleeping tonight: think about your conflicts. What is your biggest conflict in life? What are you attached to that you don't want to change? What do you believe about your life?

Give this conflict to the subconscious as offering. Ask the subconscious to show you in dreams what your next crisis will be if you don't transform this conflict consciously.

Change your perception: the darkness, the conflicts are not your enemies. They only became enemies because you THINK they are enemies. Change yourself - they will also change for you.

### Applying This Teaching

Stop looking at conflicts as problems to solve by eliminating one side. Every time you think "this side is bad, that side is good," you're creating duality that will perpetuate conflict endlessly.

Instead ask: what's the THIRD option? What can be created that's entirely new, that uses both energies working together? Mom + Dad = Child. Seed + Soil = Plant with roots and flowers. Positive + Negative current = Kundalini spiral upward.

In your personal life: where are you fighting against the very thing pressing you? That pressure is MEANT to make you create roots, to grab hold of what oppresses and use it as leverage for growth. Stop fighting it; start using it.

Politically and socially: stop waiting for better leaders to fix broken systems. The system itself needs transformation into a third option. And that transformation MUST start within you becoming a coherent citizen. This spiritual work IS citizenship training for the new world.

Take all this month's teachings as preparation to be a responsible, aware, coherent citizen. You're not just doing spiritual practice - you're preparing to participate consciously in creating new systems, new societies, new ways of living together.

When facing any conflict, ask: "What third option am I not seeing? How can I create roots that use this pressure for my growth? What wants to be born from these opposing forces working together?"

The universe creates through conflict resolution, not conflict elimination. Be like nature: use pressure as evolutionary catalyst, not as enemy to destroy.

## Q&A

**Q: Isn't conflict something to avoid if we want peace?**
**A:** No - conflict is a natural tool for evolution. Everything beautiful in nature came from pressure/conflict. Avoiding conflict means avoiding growth. The key isn't eliminating conflict but approaching it consciously to find third options rather than fighting unconsciously in polarity.

**Q: What's the difference between conscious and unconscious conflict?**
**A:** Unconscious conflict is pure polarity - "I'm right, you're wrong, I'm good, you're bad" - fighting endlessly. Conscious conflict recognizes two energies can create something entirely new together (a third option) rather than one defeating the other.

**Q: How do we find the "third option"?**
**A:** Stop thinking in terms of either/or. Ask: what can be created using BOTH energies together? Like seed + soil creates plant with roots and flowers. Like mom + dad creates child. The third option emerges from cooperation, not competition.

**Q: Why do we need roots if we're spiritual beings?**
**A:** Because we're SEEDS trying to grow. Seeds that refuse to root never become plants - they just stay seeds complaining about pressure. Roots grab the very thing pressing you and use it for stability and nutrients to grow upward toward light.

**Q: How does changing ourselves change politicians/systems?**
**A:** Law of correspondence - outside reflects inside. Coherent politicians can only exist when coherent citizens exist to support them. Changing the system starts with changing yourself. Take this work as citizenship training, not just spiritual practice.

**Q: What if the conflict really IS someone oppressing me?**
**A:** Even if true, fighting back in polarity just perpetuates the cycle. The soil really IS pressing the seed - that's factually true. But the seed's survival isn't fighting soil; it's using soil pressure as leverage to grow. Find how to use the pressure, not just resist it.

**Q: Why give conflicts to darkness before sleep?**
**A:** Because conflicts show us our limitations, which we created ourselves. Darkness can show through dreams how to use conflicts for evolution. By offering the conflict to subconscious, you stop seeing it as enemy and start seeing it as teacher.

**Q: Aren't tornadoes/hurricanes destructive?**
**A:** They create chaos around them, yes. But they're balancing the atmosphere so the whole system can function and we can breathe. What looks like destruction is actually reorganization. Same with personal crises - they feel destructive but they're reorganizing you into new form.
