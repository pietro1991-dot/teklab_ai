## Overview

Today marks the beginning of the physical week of Aries, introducing the fundamental concept of initiation. This word, which many know from the series "Initiation" on Gaia, represents the core of what we do every day in this path. The topic encompasses not only the historical evolution of initiation practices but also their practical application in our daily spiritual journey.

Initiation comes from the Latin "in-ire," meaning to start moving forward from within. It represents the action of beginning something new, of stepping into unknown territory with the intention to learn and grow. Throughout history, this concept has been central to both educational systems and spiritual traditions.

The week ahead focuses on establishing our own initiatory path, creating a physical map of sacred spaces that correspond to the nine chakras. Whether inside our homes or spread across our neighborhoods or cities, we will walk this path daily, visiting different chakra locations according to the day's focus.

## Core Teaching

### The Etymology and Meaning of Initiation

Initiation derives from two Latin words: "in" (inside) and "ire" (to go). Together, "ire" means to start moving, to begin moving forward. The concept fundamentally speaks to the action of starting to move forward from within oneself.

In modern culture, we use "initiation" in two main contexts. First, in education, referring to the introduction or beginning of learning about new topics like mathematics, music, or medicine. It represents starting to do something we didn't know before. Second, in what we now call esoteric or hermetic traditions, though this connection also relates deeply to education.

### The Hermetic Tradition and Hidden Knowledge

The hermetic concept comes from Hermes, the Greek god of communication and teaching, known in Egypt as Thoth and in Roman culture as Mercury. Hermes gave information to people, teaching them about everything. When monotheistic religions arrived in Europe and the Mediterranean, they began persecuting these free thinkers who studied in public squares, considering them wrong and against God.

This persecution forced hermetic (Hermes-related) information into hiding, creating occultism. The word "occult" simply means hidden. These students weren't doing satanic practices; they were hiding to avoid being killed. From that moment, secret societies and closed associations emerged. Christians labeled their ceremonies as satanic because they couldn't understand what was happening, which is why initiation ceremonies came to seem weird or devilish from certain perspectives.

Both educational and hermetic uses of initiation relate fundamentally to the process of learning and education.

### Historical Development of Initiatory Tests

Going back in history, initiation into studies was forbidden for a long time. Those who wanted to preserve and share knowledge had to organize tests and trials that seekers would solve to prove they truly had the attributes and will to study this protected information, ensuring they weren't enemies in disguise.

These tests protected universities hidden underground, in the shadows. The Kabbalistic philosophy in Judaism particularly contributed to this system. Within the great monotheistic religions, Kabbalah was unique in making questions, telling people to doubt all things, even to doubt creation itself. This was totally against what mainstream religions like Islam and Christianity taught, which emphasized certainty and faith in God.

Because of these questions, main religions considered Kabbalah wrong and devilish. Hidden universities and hermetic schools started using Kabbalistic systems to create hidden maps so seekers could find the underground universities. This is why in England, these hidden societies were called "the cabal."

Today we have a misunderstanding of what Kabbalah really is. Many people say "they are the bad ones," but this idea comes from Christians who labeled underground seekers this way. In reality, these were free thinkers preserving knowledge.

### Renaissance to Enlightenment

During the past 500 years, when the Renaissance started, Europe was still under the Inquisition. The Inquisition was so strong that it persecuted all free thinkers. Renaissance thinkers brought back concepts from the Middle East, Greece, and ancient philosophy, starting to change everything, but they were also persecuted.

This is why they hid themselves until they were strong enough to show their truth. Renaissance culture created the idea that students were doing hermeticism in hiding, which seemed like paganism to the religious authorities.

In the last 300 years, starting in the late 1700s, the Illuminati also spread in Europe but were persecuted. This created the modern idea of "the Illuminati." They were persecuted and hidden, doing these studies until rationalism started in the states after revolutions.

Before the Illuminati, there were also the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, the Knights of Malta, and the Templars. These were all parallel movements within Christianity that kept the traditions of initiation from way before.

### The University System and the 33 Degrees

Until just 200 years ago, there were no universities as we know them today with public and private institutions teaching all kinds of knowledge. Universities were prohibited, existing only as religious teachings. To reach universal knowledge, students had to go through tests, sessions before and sessions after.

The most known hidden university in Europe and also in America was the Freemasons. They followed 33 initiatory sessions to reach the 33rd degree. They conducted exams to pass tests at each level. Think about universities today: you study, take a test or exam, and must do it correctly to advance to the next level, the next year. You go through these steps, and in each one you have an initiation telling you that you've reached the next level.

This was originally created to learn and access universal knowledge. Of course, later they started using it for power and political positions, but fundamentally, this was all made to learn and access universal knowledge.

### Initiatory Traditions Across Civilizations

Initiatory traditions from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, America, and Australia all kept these processes from old civilizations. These ancient civilizations were built with the idea that people had to know God and understand the Creator. The way to understand the Creator is through knowledge of the things the Creator has created.

It wasn't through blind faith in the Creator but by knowing the things the Creator has done: the body, the soul, the spirit. They created paths and universities where people could go through tests to prove their knowledge of their bodies, souls, and spirits, getting closer to the knowledge of God and to God itself.

This is why initiatory paths were created in ancient civilizations like Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Atlantean civilizations.

### The Original Nomadic Initiation

These civilizations' initiatory paths came from much older times, from when humans first spread along the world following animals in their migrations. As nomads, we moved through the planet because of weather changes, following animals in their migrations. Animals followed lakes, wells inside the ground, or the flow of rivers.

Humans also followed these rivers, and this is how we started to understand that by moving ahead, we were learning new things, knowing many other places, reaching the divine, knowing about the stars and the earth. Cultures of that time understood that when they moved through these natural paths, they were learning about the planet, the world, nature, animals, and also about themselves so they could teach others.

Every year they would send young people on this kind of natural path through forests, deserts, rivers, and mountains. These young people would have this initiatory process in which they would understand the nature of the world. That's how the tradition of learning and acknowledging the world began, eventually developing into civilizations with initiatory paths that became universities.

### Initiation in Daily Life

An initiation is basically the thing we do every day when we wake up. We wake up and initiate something: a new day, something new to learn. Every time we learn something, we are in an initiatory process. Every time we move forward to do something new, to learn something new, to share something new, we are doing an initiatory process.

The good thing about initiation is that it's not reactive but active. Reactive would be if something pushes me to do it, so I react. But an initiatory process is acting, taking action because it's something I am willing to do, something I am willing to learn.

What we are doing in this path, the Path of the I Am, is an initiatory process. We are doing an initiation where day by day we learn something new. Throughout this long process of the year or two years, we are learning something every day. The initiatory process will culminate on February 22, 2022. That will be the moment of initiation to end this process.

### Creating Your Personal Initiatory Path

The physical week invites us to make an initiatory path even if we are in lockdown inside our homes. The task for this week is to create our own initiatory path. It doesn't matter if you do it inside your home, in the garden, in the neighborhood, in the entire village or city, or in an entire region. Whatever is best for you to adapt to.

We will decide the size of our initiatory path and attach chakra concepts to specific places. You can choose a church, school, bathroom, kitchen, whatever you feel connects with each chakra. In today's post, there are suggestions for which places could represent each chakra.

Choose nine places within your house, neighborhood, or city. Pick these nine places and put the attribute of one chakra in each. For example, if it's a home: the heart chakra is the kitchen, the throat chakra is the bathroom, the root chakra is the bed.

Don't do this on paper, thinking about walking the path mentally. We are not doing that. We need to walk the path physically. Even if you want to put a glass of water, a stone, a plant, or whatever to refer to that chakra, it should be separated in different places because you have to walk to those places. You have to practice it by walking.

### Daily Practice Structure

Every day we will go to a specific spot according to the day's chakra. Tomorrow is the day of the third eye, so tomorrow we go to the spot that refers to the third eye. The alignments will be done in a different order this week (going upward from below), but the daily tasks follow the normal chakra sequence.

According to the day and chakra, we'll go and do a different task. The crown chakra will be done on the 10th day (Taurus), as Taurus comes back to the crown chakra. Each day we're going to go and do a different task, all together, everyone together.

This week will be practice for what we will do during the blue moon in August. Remember that alignments this week will be from below going up, ascending. That's the change during the alignments, but the days remain the same: tomorrow third eye, then throat chakra, then heart, and so on.

## Practice

### Preparation

Become aware of the space that surrounds you, the body you inhabit, and your own breathing. Below your feet, observe a divine spark, light representing your body's consciousness. Breathe and ignite the spark.

### Ascending the Inner Nile

Ascend this divine spark to your feet. Observe this divine spark arriving at your feet, recognizing the two sacred lakes that give birth to the White Nile and Blue Nile rivers coming out through your legs. And in its waters, ignite this fire like sand.

Feel this divine spark as sand ascending to your ankles. Observe this fire in your body, this fire in your feet surrounded by two rivers, one in each foot, rising up as two strings of water, one white and the other blue. Feel these two rivers, white and blue, rising within you.

Feel these two rivers getting together in your knees, feminine and masculine, joining with the fire, the heat of the sand around. You are created by these two forces.

Ignite this fire in your history. Feel this snake of light, this spark of fire rising up to your root chakra. Feel both forces: the mother creator and the father creator, both together in you, the fire and water, the two forces igniting you. Ignite this spark, activating this snake of light.

With deep breath, ascend this snake to the sacral chakra. Feel this strength of creation, the island in the river of light, the womb of the mother that is creating entire humanity. Its force lives within you. Recognize its power of creation within, and ignite the temple of creation within you.

Arise this force of fire to the plexus, between the shadows and the lights. Following the light of the fire snake, the river Nile within you, activate the temples for the self, the light of who you are. Ignite the being that you are with its shadows and its lights. Arise it.

Ascend with this river of light to the heart. Ignite within you the temple of creation of love, the cube, the house of light, Hathor. Through the love and beauty, radiate the flower of life through the waters of this flow. Ignite the life in you.

Through your voice, the 12 rays of light and truth shine from the sun that is you, radiating the truth of the universe. Ignite the light in the process of learning and teaching what you are.

Rise up the light and water of this divine river to your third eye. Ignite the light through your eyes, reflecting the eyes of things watching, staring at you, watching deep to your real truth, to whom you really are. Ignite the light in the keeper of your consciousness.

Ignite the light in this river, in the delta of light. Activate the crown in this delta with all the rivers that enlarge the crown of your inner Nile, and within the pyramids, the octahedrons that connect you with all the dimensions of your being. Ignite the seed of your spirit.

### Closing Integration

Recognize now that this is the initiatory path of the entire world, of all humanity living within you. You are the secret path of the Nile. You are the universal designer.

Take a deep breath and start to massage your body. Recognize the path that you go through. Activate the initiatory path of the Nile within yourself.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Create your personal initiatory path by choosing nine physical locations that will represent each of the nine chakras. These can be inside your home, in your neighborhood, or spread across your city. Mark each location in a way that reminds you which chakra it represents (a stone, plant, glass of water, or any meaningful object).

Tomorrow, visit the location you've designated for the third eye chakra and perform the practice there. Each subsequent day, visit the corresponding chakra location according to the daily focus.

### Applying This Teaching

Remember that you engage in initiatory processes constantly. Every time you choose to learn something new, step outside your comfort zone, or deliberately grow, you are initiating. Honor these moments as sacred acts of conscious evolution.

Consider your entire life as one long initiatory path, with each challenge and learning opportunity as a waypoint bringing you closer to understanding yourself and the divine. The external initiatory path you create this week mirrors the internal initiatory journey you walk every day.

## Q&A

### Q: What is the real meaning of initiation beyond the mysterious associations?

Initiation simply means to start moving forward from within. It's the action of beginning to learn something new, whether that's mathematics, music, spiritual practices, or self-knowledge. The mysterious associations came from historical persecution that forced educational societies underground.

### Q: Why were initiatory societies and schools forced to hide?

When monotheistic religions gained power in Europe and the Mediterranean, they persecuted free thinkers who questioned religious dogma and studied openly. To avoid being killed, these students and teachers went underground, creating what we call occultism (which simply means "hidden"). They weren't doing satanic practices; they were preserving knowledge and the freedom to question.

### Q: What is the true nature of Kabbalah and why was it considered dangerous?

Kabbalah is a philosophical tradition within Judaism that encourages questioning everything, even doubting creation itself. This was revolutionary because mainstream religions emphasized certainty and faith without question. Kabbalah's approach of saying "we don't know, maybe, perhaps" threatened religious authority, so it was labeled as evil and from the devil.

### Q: How do the Freemasons' 33 degrees relate to modern universities?

The 33 degrees of Freemasonry were essentially an underground university system. Before public universities existed (only about 200 years ago), knowledge was restricted to religious teachings. The Freemasons created a structured learning path with tests at each level, very similar to how modern universities have grades and exams you must pass to advance.

### Q: What is the connection between ancient river paths and spiritual initiation?

When humans were nomadic, we followed animals along rivers, learning about the world, nature, stars, and ourselves. Ancient cultures recognized that walking these paths brought knowledge and divine understanding. They formalized this into initiatory practices, sending young people on journeys through forests, deserts, and mountains to gain wisdom. This became the foundation for later temple-based initiatory paths.

### Q: How do I practice initiation in my daily life?

Recognize that every morning when you wake up and choose to learn something new, you're engaging in initiation. It's about actively choosing growth rather than reactively responding to life. Make conscious decisions to step into the unknown, to learn, to transform. This path we're walking together is itself an initiatory process, learning something new each day.

### Q: Why must the initiatory path be physical rather than mental or on paper?

The body needs to experience the journey. Walking physically engages your entire being—body, mind, and spirit—in a way that mental visualization cannot replicate. The act of moving through space, visiting different locations, and physically performing practices at each spot creates real transformation. Your cells, your nervous system, your entire being registers the experience as real.

### Q: What should I do if I cannot walk due to physical limitations?

You can use your hands to touch different parts of your body, creating steps along your own physical form. However, if you can walk at all, even with assistance, do walk the path. The point is to engage the body in movement and physical practice, not to stay purely in the mental realm.
