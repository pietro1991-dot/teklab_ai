# Day 220 - The Zero Dimension: The Eternal Void

**Author:** Matias De Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Toroid (the field around and within the body)
- **Week Theme:** Pisces Emotional Week
- **Main Topic:** The Zero Dimension - Void, Eternity, 144 Attributes, Liberation from Meaning
- **Vibration:** `Ph`
- **Statement:** `I Am at Love`
- **Code:** Feel/Feeling - this cosmic attribute emerges from the being that is capable of sensing the resonance that the entire universe creates when there is any kind of vibration or pulse. Like a spider that perceives through its legs if the vibration in the web is just the breeze or if there is a prey trapped in the web, the being learns to distinguish the feelings through what is felt in the environment. This way, the being says "I feel."

## Overview

We have arrived at the **zero dimension**—the place beyond all dimensions, the **void**, the **nothingness**, the **eternity** from which everything emerges and to which everything returns.

After learning about the first through ninth dimensions, we now discover that all of them are **concepts**—tools to help the human mind understand eternity. The zero dimension is what truly **is**: the void, the nothing, the eternal.

This is connected to the **toroid chakra**, the electromagnetic field that surrounds and permeates your entire body. The toroid represents the **zero point** at the center—the stillness around which all energy circulates.

We are completing the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where boundaries dissolve and we return to the ocean of oneness. The zero dimension is the ultimate dissolution: **no form, no time, no space, no separation—only the eternal void**.

Matias shares that understanding this dimension brings profound **relaxation**. When we realize there is **no meaning, no purpose**, we experience liberation, not despair. We are free.

## The Question "Am I?" Creates "I Am"

### From Zero to Nine

The **zero dimension** is the question: **"Am I?"**

This question, arising from the void, creates the answer: **"I Am"** (the ninth dimension).

From the question "Am I?" emerges the hologram, the projection, the "I Am." And from "I Am," all the other dimensions unfold.

But none of these dimensions **truly exist**. They are concepts, tools for understanding. Only the **zero dimension is real**—the eternal void.

### Beginning and End Are Concepts

We speak about the **beginning** and the **end**, the alpha and omega (first dimension). But these are just concepts to help us understand eternity.

**Eternity has no beginning and no end.** Those are ideas we created to make sense of something beyond comprehension.

### Polarity, Time, Space—All Concepts

Polarity (positive and negative), time (past, present, future), space (here and there)—these are all **concepts**, not ultimate reality.

The zero dimension is beyond all concepts. It is the **void**, the **nothingness** from which the question "Am I?" arises, creating the entire hologram of existence.

---

## The Fibonacci Sequence: The Code of 144

### The Pattern of Creation

Matias shares the **Fibonacci sequence** as a way to understand how creation unfolds from the zero dimension:

**0 → 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → 8 → 13 → 21 → 34 → 55 → 89 → 144**

The sequence begins with **zero** (the void). From zero comes **one** (the question "Am I?"). The two ones together create **two** (duality, polarity). And the pattern continues, each number the sum of the two before it.

### 144: The Code of Attributes

The sequence reaches **144**, which is the code for the **attributes of the universal mind, soul, and body** across all dimensions.

Each being has **144 attributes**—144 aspects of consciousness spread across all dimensions. Matias himself is one of **144 attributes of Gan** (his higher self). And within Matias, there are **144 more attributes**. And Matias is one of 144 in a larger group. It is **fractal**, repeating infinitely.

### The Twelve and the Twelve

144 is **12 × 12**: the twelve dimensions multiplied by the twelve directions.

This is the **pattern of the universe**—twelve dimensions, twelve directions, creating 144 attributes of being.

## Re-Membering: Gathering the Scattered Aspects

### Not Remembering—Re-Membering

When we speak of **re-membering**, we are not talking about **remembering the past**. We are talking about **re-membering**: putting the members back together.

A member is a **part of a body**. Re-membering is **gathering the 144 scattered aspects of yourself** back into the center, back into the zero point.

### The Scattering and the Gathering

These 144 aspects are scattered across dimensions, across lifetimes, across realities. The spiritual path is the process of **re-membering**—bringing all your aspects back together, integrating them into wholeness.

When you re-member all 144 attributes, you return to the **zero dimension**—the void, the wholeness, the eternity.

---

## Detachment: The Path to Freedom

### The Greatest Freedom

Matias teaches that the **greatest freedom** is found not in having everything but in **detachment**—in the void, the nothing.

When you are attached to physical forms, to emotional states, to mental beliefs, you are bound. But when you release attachment, when you return to the **zero point**, you are free.

### Detachment Is Not Indifference

Detachment does not mean you do not care. It means you are **not controlled** by your attachments.

You can love deeply without being attached to the outcome. You can create passionately without being attached to the result. You can live fully without being attached to life itself.

This is the **freedom of the zero dimension**.

### Letting Go of Meaning and Purpose

The human mind is designed to seek **meaning** and **purpose**. We ask: "Why am I here? What is my purpose?"

But Matias teaches that there is **no meaning, no purpose**—and this is **liberating**, not depressing.

When you release the need for meaning, you are free to create your own. When you release the need for purpose, you are free to live without burden.

The zero dimension has **no meaning**—it simply **is**. And in that "isness," there is total freedom.

---

## The Existential Void

### Ex-sistere: To Be Outside

The word **"exist"** comes from Latin: **ex-sistere**, meaning **"to be outside."**

When we exist, we are **outside** the center. We are in the projection, the hologram, the dimensions.

The **existential void** is the realization that we have moved outside the center and now seek to **return inside**—to return to the zero dimension, the void, the source.

### Non-Existence as Return to Center

**Non-existence** is not death or annihilation. It is **returning to the center**, moving from outside (existence) back inside (the void).

This is what spiritual paths call **enlightenment**, **liberation**, **awakening**—the return to the zero dimension.

### Transcendence: Moving Beyond Position

The word **"transcendence"** comes from Latin: **trans** (beyond) + **scendere** (to move up or down).

Transcendence means **moving beyond your current position**—beyond the third dimension, beyond the fourth, beyond all dimensions, back to the zero point.

---

## The Human Struggle with Void

### Why Humans Struggle

Matias acknowledges that humans **struggle** with the concept of the void because:

- We are designed to seek **meaning and purpose** (without them, we feel lost).
- We need a **mother and father** in the cosmos (we want someone to care for us).
- We are designed to **move forward** (we cannot grasp the idea of no beginning, no end).
- We cannot understand **no time, no space** (our brains are wired for dimension).

### The Design Conflict

We are **designed to exist** (to be outside the center), yet we are called to **transcend existence** (to return to the center).

This is the human paradox: we are built for the dimensions, yet our deepest longing is for the **void**.

### Already the Void

Matias teaches: you do not need to **become** the void. **You already are the void.**

All your dimensions, all your experiences, all your lifetimes—they are projections **from** the void. You have never left the zero dimension. You are simply experiencing what it is like to be outside it.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Bring your awareness to the **toroid**—the electromagnetic field around and within your body.

Feel the energy circulating around you, and feel the **zero point** at the center—the stillness, the void.

### Releasing All Dimensions

Imagine releasing your connection to the **first dimension** (beginning and end). Let go of the idea of alpha and omega.

Release the **second dimension** (connection). Let go of the lines and patterns.

Release the **third dimension** (form). Let go of your physical body, your physical reality.

Release the **fourth dimension** (time). Let go of past, present, and future.

Release the **fifth dimension** (space). Let go of here and there, above and below.

Release the **sixth dimension** (transformation). Let go of becoming.

Release the **seventh dimension** (potential). Let go of what could be.

Release the **eighth dimension** (registry). Let go of all records, all memory.

Release the **ninth dimension** (hologram). Let go of "I Am."

### Resting in the Void

Now, rest in the **zero dimension**.

There is **nothing** here. No form, no time, no space, no meaning, no purpose.

Just the **void**. The **eternal**. The **nothingness** from which all things arise.

Feel the **liberation** of having no meaning, no purpose. Feel the **freedom** of the void.

### The Vibration Ph

From the zero point, sound the vibration **Ph**.

Feel the resonance vibrating through the toroid, through the void, through all dimensions.

**I Am at love. I Am at love. I Am at love.**

Not "I Am love" but "I Am **at** love"—resting in love, at the zero point of love.

### Re-Membering the 144

Now, imagine the **144 attributes** of your being, scattered across all dimensions, across all lifetimes.

See them as points of light in the darkness. One by one, they begin to move toward the center, toward the **zero point** where you are.

**Re-member** them. Bring them back together. Integrate them into wholeness.

As each attribute returns, you become more complete, more whole, more yourself.

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Feel the toroid around you, vibrating with the energy of all 144 attributes integrated.

You are the void. You are the eternal. You are free.

Each one in your own time, come back here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Today, practice **releasing the need for meaning and purpose**. Notice when you ask, "Why am I here? What is my purpose?" and practice responding: "There is no why. I simply am."

This is not nihilism or depression—it is **liberation**. When you release the burden of needing everything to mean something, you become **free** to create your own meaning, or to live without meaning at all.

### Detachment Practice

Throughout the day, practice **detachment**:

- When you feel attached to an outcome, imagine releasing it into the void.
- When you feel attached to a belief, imagine letting it dissolve.
- When you feel attached to your identity, imagine returning to the zero point where you are nothing and everything.

Detachment is not indifference—it is **freedom**. You can still act, still care, still love, but you are **not controlled** by attachment.

### Re-Membering the 144

Spend a few minutes in meditation imagining your **144 attributes** scattered across dimensions. Where are they? What aspects of yourself have you forgotten or lost?

Invite them to **return to the center**. Visualize them as points of light moving toward the zero point in your heart.

As you re-member your scattered aspects, you become more whole.

---

## Week Context

We are completing the **Emotional Week of Pisces**, where boundaries dissolve and we return to the ocean of oneness. The zero dimension is the ultimate expression of Pisces: **total dissolution**, total surrender, total return to the source.

Pisces teaches us to **let go**, to flow, to release control. The zero dimension is the deepest letting go: releasing even the need for existence itself.

The toroid chakra (today's focus) represents the **field of being**—the electromagnetic energy that surrounds and permeates you. At the center of the toroid is the **zero point**, the stillness, the void. From this zero point, all energy circulates.

## Q&A

### Q: If nothing has meaning, why do anything?

Because you are free to create your own meaning—or to act without needing meaning. The liberation of the zero dimension is that you are **not bound** by needing everything to mean something. You can live, love, create, and act simply because you choose to, not because there is some cosmic purpose forcing you.

### Q: How is "no purpose" liberating instead of depressing?

When you believe there is one ultimate purpose you must fulfill, you carry a burden: "What if I fail? What if I never find it?" But when you release the idea of purpose, you are **free to create any purpose you choose**, or to live without purpose at all. You act from freedom, not obligation. This is joyful, not depressing.

### Q: What are my 144 attributes?

Your 144 attributes are all the **aspects of your consciousness** spread across dimensions, lifetimes, and realities. Some are past lives, some are parallel lives, some are future selves, some are dimensional aspects. You may never consciously know all 144, but the practice of **re-membering** is calling them back to integration, bringing all parts of yourself into wholeness.

### Q: How do I practically re-member my scattered aspects?

Through meditation, inner work, shadow integration, healing trauma, reclaiming lost parts of yourself, and spiritual practice. When you heal a wound, you re-member an aspect. When you integrate a shadow, you re-member an aspect. When you forgive yourself or others, you re-member an aspect. It is a lifelong (and multi-lifetime) process.

### Q: Isn't detachment the same as not caring?

No. **Detachment is freedom from control**; indifference is lack of connection. You can care deeply about something while being detached from the outcome. You can love someone fully while being detached from controlling them. Detachment allows you to engage with life fully **without being enslaved** by your attachments.

### Q: How does understanding the zero dimension help my daily life?

It helps you release the **burden of needing everything to mean something**. It helps you find peace in not knowing, in uncertainty, in the void. It helps you stop fighting reality and instead **rest in what is**. When you connect to the zero dimension, you connect to a deep stillness and freedom that exists beneath all the chaos of the dimensions.

### Q: What is the difference between the void and depression?

Depression is a **feeling of being trapped** in emptiness—feeling meaningless and powerless. The void is the **freedom of emptiness**—recognizing that you are not trapped because there is nothing to be trapped by. Depression says, "Nothing matters, and I am stuck." The void says, "Nothing matters, and I am free." One is suffering; the other is liberation.

### Q: If I'm already the void, why don't I feel it?

Because you are **identified with the dimensions**—with your body (3D), your story (4D), your beliefs (5D). The practice is to **release identification** and remember your true nature as the void. You have never left the zero dimension; you are simply experiencing what it is like to project yourself into the dimensions. Meditation, presence, and detachment help you remember.
