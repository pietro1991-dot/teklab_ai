## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

Today it seems that I am better but I do n't know if I am really , really over what happened yesterday. I am still a little bit like flowing , hesitate in the air. I do n't know if this feeling that I have like still hesitate in is this energy that I am feeling since yesterday or that I just ate in due food , in gem food and it was spicy.

So maybe that 's too. I wanted to share what happened today , the pyramid which was something really beautiful and symbolic that yesterday , I was with Judith. She came from Spain to help me to take care of me while I was in a sarcophagus.

## Q&A

So she was the uterus representing all the wounds from the network according to the task that we did.

So remember that yesterday we shared this task of bringing all the information of the uterus to the core of the uterus of the world and the pyramid is like a fractal of this uterus of the world inside.

So the chamber , the King 's chamber and the sarcophagus represents like this womb.

So where people used to lay down to die and then to resurrect to be born again.

So I was lying there in the floor and the sarcophagus. During this process and it was amazing that we were able to fill all this feminine energy from men and women , does n't matter. But we felt all this connection of all the wounds coming to the pyramid. It was so powerful.

So a big energy of the mother came to there and the sarcophagus was dirty. With someone put oil during the day , we did n't know why. But it was with some oil. And so today when we went back , we went with some people of the trip.

And when we got in , there were mainly women sitting on the sitting on the sides of the chamber. I guess there were six women or seven women. I was speaking with someone and suddenly there were four men that came into the chamber and they started to clean the sarcophagus. And it was amazing because all the women were mediating in the sides of the chamber , holding the energy.

I was talking to this person and the men were cleaning the uterus of the chamber , which is the sarcophagus.

So it was really symbolic that after where we did yesterday , they were cleaning and the men were cleaning the uterus of the feminine , of the women.

So while the women were holding that energy.

So then they left the chamber , the four men left the chamber and we started to sing to balance this clean wound.

So it was really symbolic and amazing what happened today after all the connection of the uterus.

So great.

So of course that they were , yes , they were thinking that it was us that put that because I was crying so much that they were like , were you crying? No , I have to all wet. But the sides were with this oil.

So until the moment I do n't cry fat.

## Energy Work

So it was n't me. I do n't cry oil by the moment. The other thing that I wanted to share what happened today , was really cool. It was about this person that was inside the chamber today , that he was a Egyptian guy and he was praying the crown while we were mediating and he was upset.

## Q&A

And suddenly he asked me what are you doing?

## Energy Work

So I said , well , we are mediating and he asked me about what it was. And he told me , and I asked him what are you doing? And he said , I ca n't hear every week to pray the crown to set the evil of this place and go away because this is not a place of God. And what you are doing is not for God.

It 's the evil.

## Q&A

So I asked him , so what is God?

## Energy Work

So we started this chat about the crown and the divine through the crown.

So one of the things that we were talking about was where it came from , because he said that we are slaves of God and that the other ones are mistaken.

So the only way to find this guy is the heavens is through Allah. And he said , and he told me that the Islam is just one path , but the thought , the beginning of everything was the thought , the thinking of God being above us. And that we came from one origin , which is the thought of God , and that through the time , different people to different path and darkness , about this same idea , this main idea.

So he said that most of them , they were all , most of them , they were disconnected from the origin.

## Q&A

So the question that I made him was , why?

So the rest are mistaken if all of them has the same origin.

So that question he said , well , the reason why they got mistaken is because the other religions say that God had sons or that God brought someone from this guy 's , but we will bring someone from this guy 's. And he said , but Islam is the only one that says that God created everything. And that 's it.

So that 's why we are the ones that are not mistaken.

So one thing that I asked him was , what happened with all the people that for example in South America , in Asia , North America , that never had the opportunity to be in relation with Islam. And they also felt this connection with the divine with God. And they are doing everything that they can to love God. But they do n't know the ways of Islam , so they created another religion to the same.

And what happened with them , God will love them anyway , or forgive them. And he told me , well , they will have another opportunity because they do n't know.

So they will be forgiven and they will be given another opportunity.

So I ask him , why , why if God takes us slaves , he allowed for so long that people take other ways to rich him.

So what I ask him was , if God takes us slaves , why is n't the path to God is love? Why would love? Why is n't unfair that all these people that had an opportunity to face this lamb? To let them die without this opportunity to face this lamb , to go and to find Islam.

And they die , not knowing , would n't this be unfair.

So he said , well , it 's not unfair because they will have an opportunity , a tiny opportunity to do it. And I said , but if God is love , would n't allow him to come back. And I said , yes , they would come back. But so I said , if God is love , given this opportunity , would n't him allow you to love him through the love of your mom , the love of your wife , the love of your daughter , of your kids.

So then I ask him , if you are allowed to love God through your family , why we can not love God through the stars on the earth , if that is also his creation.

So I told him , no , we are not , so he said , but let me state that you are doing is that you are praying to stop to things. And you can only pray to God. And I said , no , that 's an mistake. We are praying to God.

We are praying to God. Through the things that he created.

So I said to him , look at them with our mediating. They do n't know Islam. They do n't know the words of Islam.

So they are mediating and singing because they do n't know the words.

So they sing to God instead of praying.

So he said , so I said to him , that you are here knowing the words of God , knowing the Quran. I 'll allow us to hear the words of the Quran.

So what you are doing here is helping us to also understand this other way to communicate with God.

So I ask him , do you think that God , if he is love , would forgive this women that are mediating here , trying to communicate with him , because they do n't know the words in Islam? And he , of course , said , yes , sure.

So I said to him , so thank you for what you are doing for praying the Quran , why we are mediating. Because we are doing what you are doing here is helping us. And we are communicating all with God.

So we shake hands and he thanked me for what we were doing. And I thank him for what he was doing.

Sometimes we have this problem because we do n't speak to each other. But basically we are doing the same. And I thank him because he taught me about a lot of things of the Quran that I did n't know. And he left with this smile.

So it was good.

So related to what happened yesterday and what happened today with this conversation is what I felt like , claim it to it.

So , plainly , it is this feeling that we have not when we feel ourselves with so many things from the outside , until we just believe in our own vision , but when we open to receive and to share from the heart , what we simply are.

So we have two visions about plainitude. One is to be full and the other one is to be plenty. To be full , basically is when you just receive things from the outside and just eat all the things from the outside , without any space to change your own perception , to change yourself. And to be plenty is the opposite.

Instead of just feeling up yourself with stuff from the outside , you just feel the void. And when you feel the void within , you have the space for everything. And it 's in that moment when we feel inside , stop being , stop limitations and becomes to be expansive.

The reason why we perceive plainitude with being full is because , you know , our body , what we are trying to do is to feel ourselves with things to fill up the gaps that we have inside. Because we feel insecure because we do n't want to die.

So we want to have things to feel full.

Some of us used to say that when you have a plain systemic , you have a happy heart. And this sentence of feeling up systemic in order to feel happy is not only something physical , it 's something cultural. This is why when we start the path of spirituality , we also begin to try to eat and to feel , to feel up ourselves with concepts , expectations , ideas. And it 's not bad when you do this because it 's a way in which you can assimilate information.

What is really bad is when we do this , the living that is the only way. This is how Adolfmann appears.

So this is why we should not fill up our stomach. We should always eat , live in an empty space.

So we can feel more light. Because this empty space is the one that allows you to feel with much more energy to open to new things to be more flexible. This is why fasting is the way to purify the mind. Full stomach , happy heart , empty stomach , free mind.

And this is exactly the same in the opposite. Empty mind , happy heart and happy body. And the society that we have designed for us , we are scared to an empty mind. We are scared to not have any belief.

And we have to know that an empty mind is not a mind that does n't have anything inside. An empty mind is the one that is open to everything.

So this is why imagine if instead of opening myself to this lamp today , I would have been just defending my position of no we are all God. What would happen? And this is what happened throughout all our lives when we find ourselves with different visions and dimensions.

So remember , planetitude is not to feel up yourself with many ideas of the eye , the me. Planetitude is the ability to be open to who am I , who I am. The planetitude can be only filled. Can be only filled from the void because the void holds the everything.

## Daily Practice Elements

Let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is the V. The statement for today is I am the legacy of the heart. The code for today is color red.

Very low vibrations are expressed in the deepest vibration. A mountain is the infrared. A vibration that all that exists manages and that originates the warm visible reds color fire and the spark of energetic creation. This way red is related with the tetrahedron with a Kundalini with the lower vibration of light where the shadows , the hidden.

The sexual and energetic , the velocity move.

## Q&A

So it 's connected then. There are some people that were asking , what was the message of the future that you received?

Sorry , I 'm not going to share it because it 's my future. We begin to take the breath , just stretch the body. Take a deep breath. I recognize that I find myself on the top after the heretic mountain between the clouds.

Far away below the savanna and its animals. I take them in my memory for their I find my origin.

Now I will begin to pass through the deepest desert , the heavy one. And I see this desert from the top of the mountain. In my hand , I hold the crystal that I receive. At the time I go in front of the lion.

I see now from the sky and you light the sending. This time there 's a quantity ship made with geometry , radiating the light everywhere. And within the sight of it , it has a fire. And when it reaches the ground , it touches a tiny tree.

And the tree in lights in a fire , the dust in burn. Take a deep breath. I get closer to the fire and I remember that I have asked who are you and the fire answered. I give to this fire my crystal and decide the leverage I see how the fire turns the rock , the crystal , and to dust the light as it shines.

And the light with its voice tells me , reminded me.

Now the crystal that shines is your heart. And reminds me , go back to the heart and expand its speed.

So I go down the hill running through the desert. Crossing a dead sea , following the stream of a river until I find a place of peace. And there , over a rock , sign me for people that they are waiting for me. I did closer to them and they invited me to be in the centre.

The fourth time I am the Messiah. And I recognize in their faces the main prophets of the four main religions.

So with my vibration , I give to them the legacy of the iron from my heart. The Messiah keeps pronouncing the vibration. I feel the fire of the iron and lighting from my heart and lighting the four prophets. And I remind them , I am the legacy of the heart.

I am the legacy of the heart. Love , I am life , I am the path , I am the truth , I am delight , I am why I am. I am the legacy of the heart. I am the path , I am the path , I am the path , I am the path.

Let us next look Take your deep breath. Slowly , each one of its own time , come back here and now open your eyes. Thank you everybody for being here and now. Thank you for being here.
