## Overview

Today's teaching is about **setting free**—but not in the way we usually understand it.

Setting free is not:
- Detachment
- Letting go
- Getting rid of something
- Abandoning

**Setting free is like a tree dropping its leaves in autumn—not to waste them, but to compost them and create new life.**

This is especially important when working with anger, frustration, and intense emotions.

## Vibration, Energy, and Matter: One Thing

### The Water Analogy

Vibration, energy, and matter are **the same thing** in different states.

Like water:
- **Ice** (solid) = matter
- **Liquid** = energy
- **Vapor** (gas) = vibration

They're not three different things. They're one substance in three states.

### Strings and Knots

Everything is vibration—strings vibrating at different frequencies.

When strings vibrate in **coherence**, they flow smoothly.

When strings vibrate in **discord**, they create **knots**—blockages in the flow.

These knots become:
1. First: vibrational conflicts
2. Then: energetic tensions
3. Finally: physical illnesses

**All illness originates in vibrational discord.**

## Matias' Personal Example: Watching the News

### The Experiment

This past week, I decided to watch the news every day, all the time—an experiment to see how it would affect me.

**Result**: I had a horrible week.

- Couldn't do anything
- Was tired all the time
- Energy was so low
- Felt paralyzed

### The Recovery

This morning, I decided:
- Not to watch the news
- To put on some humor instead
- To express what was inside

And I was able to **paint**. I created art that expressed all the darkness, fear, and heaviness I'd absorbed.

The paintings were scary, dark, intense—but by **expressing** them, I freed the energy.

### The Lesson

**Vibration affects your energy, and energy affects your matter (body and reality).**

If you consume low-vibration information (fear, conflict, violence) constantly, it **lowers your vibration**, which creates **energetic blockages**, which manifest as **physical and emotional problems**.

---

## Two Types of Expression

### Positive Expression: Kundalini Flow

When energy flows smoothly up through the chakras and out through the crown, this is **coherent expression**.

The energy:
- Enters through the root
- Flows through each chakra
- Expresses through the throat
- Releases through the crown
- Returns to the universe

This is healthy flow. This is life force moving as it should.

### Negative Expression: Hurting Self and Others

When there are **knots** in the chakras (vibrational discord), the energy can't flow smoothly.

Instead, it gets **pressured** (compressed in the center) and explodes outward in destructive ways:
- Yelling at loved ones
- Hurting yourself
- Breaking things
- Violent reactions

This is not release. This is **discharge**—like a pressure cooker exploding because the valve is blocked.

---

## Tension vs. Pressure (Revisited)

### Tension Between Chakras

When there's **tension** (the capacity to extend) **between** the chakras, energy flows.

The chakras pull on each other like a string, allowing vibration to travel.

### Pressure in the Center

When there's **pressure** (compression) in the **center** of a chakra, energy gets stuck.

It can't flow up or down. It builds and builds until it explodes sideways—hurting you and others around you.

---

## Setting Free: The Tree Metaphor

### What Trees Do

In autumn, trees drop their leaves.

Are they "letting go"? Are they "detaching"?

No.

They're **setting free** the leaves to become **compost**—which will nourish the tree's roots and create new growth in spring.

**The tree doesn't waste anything. It transforms.**

### What You Should Do

When you have anger, frustration, darkness, or any intense emotion:

**Don't suppress it.** (Creates pressure)

**Don't discharge it on others.** (Hurts people)

**Set it free to compost.**

---

## The Practice: Using "Bad Words" as Tools

### Why Bad Words?

Your **vocal cords** are designed to release energetic tension.

Sound is vibration. When you make sound, you release vibrational energy.

"Bad words" carry **strong energetic charge**—that's why they're powerful.

### The Exercise

1. **Take a pillow**
2. **Hit the floor with the pillow** as many times as you need
3. **Shout and say all the bad words** you can possibly say
4. **Release all the tension and energy** into the pillow and floor

This is not about meaning. It's about **vibration**.

The words carry energy. You're releasing that energy **outside of you** in a safe way.

### The Crucial Second Step

After you've released all the energy:

**In the same spot, breathe all that energy back in—like compost.**

You're not taking back the anger or frustration. You're taking back the **life force energy** that was trapped in those emotions.

Like the tree uses composted leaves as fertilizer, you use the released energy as **fuel**.

## Expression Types Summary

### Healthy Release (Setting Free):

1. Recognize the energy inside (anger, fear, etc.)
2. Express it safely (pillow, art, sound, movement)
3. Breathe it back as pure energy (compost)
4. Use that energy for creation

### Unhealthy Suppression:

1. Feel the energy
2. Push it down ("I shouldn't feel this")
3. Creates pressure in chakras
4. Leads to illness or explosion later

### Harmful Discharge:

1. Feel the energy
2. Immediately express it on others
3. Hurts relationships
4. Doesn't transform the energy, just moves it to someone else

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Become aware of your breath, body, and presence.

### Throat Activation

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark.

Bring this light to your **throat chakra**.

### Recognizing What Needs Release

Feel into your throat—what words haven't been said? What truth hasn't been expressed?

### Setting Intention

Set the intention to **set free** any energy that's stuck in your throat.

Not to get rid of it. Not to discharge it on others.

But to **release it so it can compost and regenerate**.

### Sound Practice

Sound: **Re**

**I am coherent wisdom. I am coherent wisdom. I am coherent wisdom.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Crown

Bring the energy up to your **crown**.

Set free any thoughts that need to leave so they can compost into new ideas.

### Third Eye

Bring energy to **third eye**.

Set free any perspectives that no longer serve, so they can compost into new vision.

### Heart

Bring energy to **heart**.

Set free any emotions that need to transform, so they can compost into new feelings.

### Solar Plexus

Bring energy to **solar plexus**.

Set free any old identities, so they can compost into a new way of being.

### Sacral

Bring energy to **sacral**.

Set free any creations that are complete, so their energy can compost into new projects.

### Root

Bring energy to **root**.

Set free any old realities that are finished, so they can compost into new ground.

### Knees and Ankles

Bring energy to **knees and ankles**.

Set free any old paths, so they can compost into new directions.

### Integration

Feel the **coherence** now.

Nothing is wasted. Everything transforms.

You are not abandoning anything. You are **composting** to create new life.

### Closing

Take a deep breath. Stretch. Yawn. Return here and now at your own time.

## Key Insights

- Setting free ≠ detachment or letting go; it means releasing energy to compost and transform.
- Vibration, energy, and matter are one thing in different states (like ice, water, vapor).
- Strings vibrating in discord create knots → energetic tension → physical illness.
- All illness originates from vibrational conflict.
- Consuming low-vibration information (news, fear) lowers your vibration and creates blockages.
- Two types of expression: kundalini (coherent flow) vs. hurting (explosive discharge).
- Tension between chakras = healthy (allows flow); pressure in center = unhealthy (creates blockages).
- Trees set free their leaves to compost them, not waste them—we should do the same with emotions.
- "Bad words" are energetic tools—use them to release tension safely (pillow technique).
- After releasing, breathe the energy back as fuel (like compost), not as the emotion itself.
- Your vocal cords are designed to release vibrational tension through sound.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Notice what information you're consuming today.

Ask: "Is this raising or lowering my vibration?"

If something makes you feel heavy, afraid, angry, or paralyzed—**it's lowering your vibration**.

You can choose to stop consuming it.

### The Pillow Practice

When you feel intense emotion building:

1. Find a private space
2. Take a pillow
3. Hit the floor with it while shouting everything you need to say
4. Use whatever words carry the most charge
5. When finished, breathe deeply in that spot
6. Take back the pure energy as compost

This isn't childish. It's energetic hygiene.

### Creative Expression

Like Matias painting his dark feelings, find your medium:
- Draw
- Paint
- Dance
- Write
- Sing
- Move

Let the energy express safely, then transform it.

## Q&A

### Q: Isn't yelling and using bad words "negative" or "low vibration"?

If you're yelling AT someone to hurt them, yes. If you're releasing energy safely to transform it, no. Context and intention matter. The vocal cords are designed for energetic release through sound.

### Q: What if I can't do the pillow practice because I live with others?

Find any private space—car, bathroom with music playing, outdoors. Or use other forms of expression: intense physical exercise, creating art, writing uncensored in a journal.

### Q: How is this different from "venting"?

Venting often means discharging your energy onto another person (making them absorb it). Setting free means releasing the energy into neutral space (pillow, paper, movement) and then **composting it back as fuel**. You don't leave it out there; you transform and reclaim it.

### Q: Can I set free positive emotions too, or just negative ones?

The practice works for any intense energy. Even joy can become overwhelming. Setting it free doesn't mean you lose it—you transform its expression.

### Q: What does "breathing it back as compost" actually mean?

After releasing the charged emotion, the energy is now separated from the story/meaning. You breathe in the pure life force energy (without the anger/fear attached) and use it as fuel for creation.

### Q: How do knots in the energetic strings create physical illness?

Vibration → energy → matter. Discord in vibration creates energetic blockages. If sustained, these blockages manifest as physical symptoms. The body is trying to express what the energetic system cannot release.

### Q: Why did watching the news affect you so strongly?

News is designed to capture attention through fear, conflict, and urgency—all low vibrations. Constant exposure saturates your field with these frequencies, which then manifest as low energy, paralysis, and heaviness.
