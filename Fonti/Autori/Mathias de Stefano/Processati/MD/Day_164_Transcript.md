# Day 164 - Relations

## Summary

Day 164 revolutionizes the concept of **Relationships** by returning to its etymological root: **"to expand again and again."** Contrary to modern belief that a relationship means being "locked" or "closed" with someone, the true meaning is to **extend, expand, and bring something from inside to outside repeatedly**. The teaching traces relationships back to cave families exchanging resources (meat, fruits, seeds, goats)—leaving their caves to reach others, exchange, and return home, **repeating this once and again**. This is the origin: **relationship = expanding ourselves and communicating with others**, not attachment. The evolution continues: families united through children (**matrimonio** = one mother, one child uniting two families), tribes formed, kings/queens created as symbols of unity, kingdoms expanded through marriages. However, this entire system was built on **survival and resource exchange**—not love. The teaching reveals that modern "romance" comes from the Roman Empire's expansion and conquest, and our relationship vocabulary (conquest, romantic, possess, slave) is inherited from **imperialism**. Today's relationships are still based on **slavery concepts**: owning someone, being owned. The true meaning of relationship is revealed: **necessity = never stops = constant expansion**. We're always looking for relationships because we're in the necessity of expanding to see something different, to feel free. The Capricorn question: **"What for?"** Not to fill gaps within, but to **expand ourselves**. When you start the path of enlightenment, old conditional relationships end—not to be alone forever, but to **change the way you relate** with people. Freedom in relationships.

## Key Concepts

### Etymology and True Definition
- **Relation:** "re" (again) + "la" (to extend/expand) + "teo" (action)
- **The action of expanding again, once and again**
- Bringing something from one point to another, again and again
- **Modern misconception:** "I am in a relationship" = closed to someone, locked, not able to diagnose
- **True meaning:** To expand, to bring something inside to the outside, to do it again, to expand myself in a different level

### Origin in the Caves (Ancient Exchange)
**Scenario:** Different cave families had different resources
- One family had **meat**
- Another family far away had **fruits**
- Another family had **seeds**
- Another had **goats**

Each family had something different but **lacked** what others had.

**Solution:** Leave caves, expand their path, reach other people, **exchange** things
- "I give you seeds, you give me fruits"
- Exchange and return home
- **Repeat the same system once and again**

**This is relation:** The action of expanding myself outside and communicating with others.

**Relationship = expand ourselves and communicate with others** (not attachment)

### Evolution: From Exchange to Unity (Matrimonio)

**Next Step:** One family has an idea
- "Instead of just exchanging, why don't we put both families together?"
- "How can we ensure our family always has meat and the other always has fruits?"
- "How can we have a better relationship?"

**Solution:** **With the same blood**
- Put the blood of this family and that family together, creating one son or daughter
- The child = **symbolism of unity**, putting two families together
- The physical way to unite two things = one kid

**Forced Relationship:**
- Daughter of the fruit family + son of the meat family = forced to live in relationship
- They have a kid to **integrate both families**
- This is where we call **matrimonio**

### Matrimonio (Marriage) Origin
- **Matrimonio:** Latin "matrimonio" = **one mother, one mother**
- Means: you have only one mother, having one kid
- That only kid is the one that **puts everyone together**
- Marriage began as **family integration for survival**, not because of love

**Then love came later**, but the origin was survival strategy.

### Expansion: Tribes and Kingdoms

**Bigger Families:**
- Fruit family + meat family create bigger family
- Seeds family says: "Let's do the same"
- They unite, creating **larger groups**

**Two Big Families Unite:**
- Same strategy: one daughter + one son = one kid to unite both big families
- **Live all together**
- Only one person connects them all

**This creates:** The concept of the **King or Queen**
- The king/queen = **one that will divide the groups into tribes**
- The king/queen represents the **unity of all these different people**

### Tribute and Tribes
- **Tribe:** The groups of the family
- **Tribute:** From the same word as "tribe"
- People from tribes give a **tribute** to the king/queen to keep them as the representation bringing them all together
- King/queen = **symbol of unity of all the tribes**

**Historical Context:**
From today's point of view, we can say "this is horrible," but we must understand the origin. For that time, the king/queen was the **only concept that helped everyone be together to survive as one**. The king/queen was the main system able to **hold us all in a relationship**.

### Kingdom Expansion (Blood Marriages)
- King willing to look for another king
- Convince the other to put together a relationship in a **natural body** (blood)
- Kingdom starts to grow
- See this in movies: queens make arrangements of **natural marriages** to have a kid so they can make a **bigger empire, bigger kingdom by blood**

### Relations and Survival (Core Understanding)
**Key Principle:** From caves to kingdoms, relationships were about **survival and resource exchange**.

The **first relationships were trying to make families put together to survive**—that's all.

### Modern Concept: Relationships as Ownership

**The Shift:**
- Perception of relationship = **expand and communicate** (original)
- Transformed into: **owning someone** (modern)

**Why?**
- Past 2,000-3,000 years: people used to **bind people**—men having young women or young men for their own possession
- People **selling their own kids to grown-ups** to survive
- Relationships stopped being expansion and became **being the owner of a person**
- Someone **bought the relationship**

### Women and Reproduction (Historical Reality)

**Until Recent Times:**
- Women started to work relatively recently
- For the last 2,000-3,000 years, women were just to reproduce—considered only for mothers
- Why? Thought women were just to have kids
- Whoever had a daughter: first thing to do = **marry her with someone with more resources**
- Between **11-15 years old** (period of reproduction): try to match her with someone older with money/resources
- Family was poor, could have more resources to survive through her marriage

**This happened in many cultures, even today in some cultures—and still happens in Western civilization.**

### The 15/16 Celebration (Dark Origin)
- **Feudalism system:** Still celebrated today in South America, Mexico
- **The 16 (or 15) celebration:** Prepares the little woman to be **shown to all these men**
- Let them know: "You can now say how much you will pay to have her uterus"
- In feudalism time: women between 11-16 years old put in public in front of men
- Men decide and **fight over who is paying more** for having her

**Tradition continues today:** Celebrating the 15 or 16—but this is a **horrible story**

**Cultural Conditioning:**
- "You have to find a good man in your life to take care of you, that loves you, that gives you food, that's a hard-working person"
- This was **natural in the past**

**Why This Made Sense Then:**
- People used to live around **30 years old** (30s-40s they died)
- No long life
- Life of a woman started when girl becomes woman (11-15 years old)
- In that moment, have kids because **only 20 more years to live**
- This matches perfectly: 15 years for sons/daughters to live alone

**This tradition created:**
- **Pederastic culture** of older people looking for younger people to survive
- Tradition kept going because of survival
- Now it's horrible, we shouldn't work with this anymore
- **But to heal it, you have to understand this story**
- Many people have this information **within their bodies**

### Relationships Become Slavery
- System transformed
- Perception: **owning someone** because people bought relationships
- Men having young women/men, people selling kids to adults to survive
- Relationships = **being the owner of a person**
- Comparison = possessing a person
- "You are romantic with a person"—these concepts come from **imperialism of owning people as slavery**

**Today:** To have a relationship is basically to **be a slave** because of this history.

### Romantic (Etymology and Imperialism)

**Why "Romantic"?**
- Romantic = related to **Rome**
- Middle Ages: every writer, philosopher, person writing about the beauty of the **Roman Empire** and cultures it created around Europe = called **the romantic**
- Romantic period: people describing beauty of cultures coming from Rome
- Languages: **Roman languages** (Spanish, Italian, Portuguese) come from Rome
- People using these languages = called **the romantic**
- "Ones related to Rome"

**What Romantics Did:**
- Described the beauty of the world, fields, people, language, cultures
- Started to be called **the romantic ones**
- Seemed to be **in love** with everything growing in Europe, everything from Rome
- Described everything with such beauty, expression of being in love
- We call that **the romantic**

**Where Romantics Came From:** **Rome**

**Where's Rome?** Place in Italy called **Latio** (region of the Latin people)

- **Latio:** "Radio" = extended plain, ground that is plain and extended
- This region = origin of **Latin people**, capital in **Rome**
- Latin people started to **expand in an empire** through Europe
- **Expand = "la"** (same as "relation")

**Connection:**
- Latin people from Latio region
- Started to expand once and again, once and again
- This is called **relation**
- **LATIO, LATIN = that region (Latio)**
- Relationships = how **Rome expanded once and again**

### Conquest and Love Vocabulary
- Rome from Latio started to expand, **conquered** different countries, villages, regions
- **Conquered/conquest** = all the terms for imperialism
- "Conquests of love" = inherited concepts
- **"Romantic" = conquest someone by romanticism**
- **"Be in a relationship"** = all words for love come from **imperialism that made people slaves**

**This is why:** Even today, we create relationships through the ideas of **slavery**.

### Necessary and Necessity (True Relationship)

**Necessary:** Latin "ne" (no) + "cessario" (cease/stop)
- **No cease, no stop**
- Something eternal, constant, never ends

**What never ends in the universe?** **Expansion.**

Remember: **Expansion = relation.**

**Key Equation:**
- **Necessity of a relation = constant**
- **Every relationship is based on a necessity and need**

### Relationships Push Expansion
**Think about your own relationships:**
- Worst relationships and best relationships you ever had
- With family, friends, partners, couples
- **Doesn't matter if worst or best**

**All of them pushed you to expand yourself** because all of them helped you see something different from your own self.

**This is called:** Expansion of consciousness.

**This expansion, looking for relations everywhere = because we are in the necessity of this.**

### Constant Search for Relationship
**Necessity = never stops, is constant.**

**What is that?**
- We are always looking for a **relationship, a new relationship**
- Something new to relate: people, environments, nature, the cosmos
- We are looking to relate with something **constantly**

**Why?**
In our inner self, we are looking to **expand to something new, to see something different, to feel free**—as many things we can see.

**To go from one relation to another with anything helps us to expand.**

**This is a need we have to feel free, expanding ourselves from the heart.**

Born from a **personal necessity and need of my own self.**

### The Capricorn Question: "What For?"

**Not about:** Getting rid of the need to be in a relationship.

**About:** Understanding **why or what I am in the need of learning** in this relationship.

**The question:** **"What for?"** (Most Capricornian question in a relationship—this is the gift of Capricorn)

**Ask yourself:**
- Am I looking for a relationship to **fill some points within me**?
- Or am I looking for a relationship to **expand myself**?

**If filling gaps:** Only thing you're doing is going into a **romantic relationship of conquest** (possession, slavery).

**Remember:** We are not here to **possess anyone or anything**. We are here to **expand ourselves through the others**.

### The Relationship You Need
**Realization:** It doesn't matter which kind of relationships you have—**the relationship you have is the one you need**.

**Questions:**
- Am I in the need of this?
- Why am I in this need?

**Sometimes:** We are still in heavy relationships because we cannot understand **what we are needing in this relationship**.

**Principle:** Until I don't recognize what I am needing in the necessity of this relationship, I will repeat it once and again, and **it will never end**.

### Enlightenment and Relationships (Divorce/Separation)

**Common Pattern:**
When someone tries to connect with themselves and starts to find the connection before they can connect with the higher self, the main thing that happens is **divorce/separation**.

**This happens to all of us** because it's the **first thing** that shows you you're in the process of awakening.

**Being alone.**

**Get ready.**

### Relationships Don't End—They Transform

**Clarification:**
When you start the path of enlightenment or the conscious path, it's **not** that you have to be alone and no relationships at all.

**What happens:**
- The whole way of relationships **ends** because there are no conditions
- A **new way of relationships begins** in a different way

**It's not that you have to be alone.**

**It's that you just change the way you relate with people.**

**There is hope.** But all of this hope depends on **you**.

## Practical Application

**Daily Practice:**
1. **List all relationships** - Family, friends, partners, work colleagues—all emotional links
2. **Identify the need** - For each relationship, ask: "What am I needing in this relationship?"
3. **Expansion or filling?** - Check: Am I expanding myself or trying to fill a gap?
4. **Practice "What for?"** - When entering or continuing a relationship, ask the Capricorn question: "What for?"
5. **Notice slavery language** - Catch yourself using possession words: "my partner," "my person," "I have them"
6. **Reframe as expansion** - Instead of "I need this person," say "This relationship helps me expand by showing me X"
7. **Write the necessity** - When stuck in a heavy relationship, write: "What necessity keeps me here?"

**Integration:**
- Use the fire circle meditation when relationship conflicts arise
- Practice "I Am the Heart's Home" when making relationship decisions
- Remember: worst and best relationships both expand you—they're all tools
- When enlightenment path begins and separation happens, remember: not permanent aloneness, just transformation

**Capricorn Emotional Week:**
Relationships reveal how we **use** emotional links with others. True use = expansion of ourselves. False use = filling gaps, possessing, slavery. The question is always: **"What for?"**

**Revolutionary Practice:**
Every relationship is showing you what you need to learn to expand. When you recognize the necessity and learn the lesson, the relationship either transforms or ends naturally—because the necessity is fulfilled. Don't hold on to fill gaps. Expand to be free.

**There is hope. Hope depends on you.**
