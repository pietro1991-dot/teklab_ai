# Day 86 - Health and Disease

## Overview

Today connects with sacral chakra in Libra Physical Week, exploring health and disease. The sacral generates energy creating our body's creation—the energy generating ourselves.

We're all together in same room (group arrived). Very likely environment for COVID, but all tested (PCR), all good. Egypt doing well with COVID—everyone has it already, so everything fine.

Yesterday we talked about feeding. Reminder: food is not only physical things. Even in Physical Week, we understand food is basically energy organized differently. When we say eating energy, we absorb energy not only from food, but from emotions (links with others) and thoughts (thinking). Everything we inherit/absorb from environment is energy, regardless of structure.

We've talked about giving and receiving—economy of being. Economy of being relates to flowing of energy: all things I eat (physical for body), receive (emotions to soul), receive (thoughts to mind)—all is energy. I have to receive it, but also give away so I can receive new things, not accumulate.

We accumulate because of fear—afraid of lack of energy. We create need of accumulating energy within body, but it's bad thing because we stuck our energy, not allowing us to move, transform ourselves. Related to these concepts (energy and how I administrate energy) we now understand two concepts: health and disease.

## Core Teaching

### Disease: Standing Still

Disease comes from Latin—word divided: dis (different) + ease (to stay calm). Ease means to stay in same place, lay down in same place, be calm—comfortable in same position.

Disease would be someone taken to process which is uncomfortable. Related to Spanish enfermedad (from Latin infirmary) meaning to stay still—not moving at all. Both concepts connected from origin of words.

What it means: you're not allowing yourself to move forward. When energy is stopped, nothing moving because you've accumulated so much energy you don't know how to flow with it. You just stand still. Concept of not moving, not transforming yourself.

Main thing to talk about: diseases not coming from outside, but starting from within. In that concept, diseases we have are related with our cells. Cells are places where all energy information is stored.

Cells are not thinking about now—usually thinking about past. Cells are product of past. What cells do is expanding energy stored in them, recorded through thousands of years or centuries in my family tree.

When I get disease, it's not my own problem—it's whole tree problem. Something maybe happened to other generations, my ancestors, that I'm expressing right now myself from within.

All these conflicts I'm inheriting are now giving result of disease. Disease is not conflict itself—disease is not end or result, consequence. It's not reason why you have problem. Reason is what happened in history, now you have consequence/result which is disease. Disease is not exactly problem.

### Disease as Tool for Acknowledgment

What is disease? Disease is system, program, tool that helps me acknowledge I have energy stopped in body that my body can't handle anymore. It's been locked inside, now it needs to move. Disease is something calling my attention so I can start working with it.

If disease is consequence, is effect of cause, we should not do same thing our society does—watch disease as problem. Disease is just effect of cause. To transform disease, to transcend disease, you have to understand it as effect. Symptoms of that effect are ones that will tell me how I can understand and find cause, origin.

In our society today, when we see disease, very moment we look for cure. When we look for cure, we're watching disease itself (effect), not cause.

### Cure vs. Healing

Cure comes from Latin "to take care"—same origin as "to care." This means you're relying your power to other that can have power to heal you, take care of you.

When disease ends (effect ends) because someone took care of you, suddenly you go out straight again and you'll have exactly same problem because there's no one taking care of you and you have no idea from where problem came.

To cure is not answer to heal disease. To cure is just short answer for present, for moment—someone helping me go through that because I don't have my tool yet. But I have to look for my own tools to find, transcend really the disease.

Other path when we recognize cure is just for tiny moment: we find other path is healing. In Spanish, sanar. You have this word in English: sanity. Sanity comes from Latin meaning to have sense of something.

To have sense means you're able to perceive and handle your five senses. Basically means you're not crazy. This is why in English, sanity is related with being crazy or being in mental health.

What really means process of healing is related with sanity—to put order on things, put order on your mind, basically to be coherent. To make process of sanity would be to order your energy, give place where each energy belongs, also get rid of energy you don't need to receive new one—basically to balance yourself.

This is why process of healing is much longer process than cure, but is more useful.

### Disease Begins Healing Process

We think disease and health are different things—completely different because disease is problem, to heal is solution. It's not like that.

As I said, process of disease is beginning of process of healing. Disease is telling you there's some energy, information you don't know where to put, it's all mixed, you don't know where it belongs.

Process of healing is process of organizing that energy in way it could be useful. This is why disease is beginning of process of healing.

From point of view of external, all diseases that come or conflicts that come from outside (virus we're seeing today) are entering our life, moving our stability. We have diseases coming from outside (virus, things from outer that affect us within).

From point of view of diseases from outside that break our balance life: at first, nothing from outside can get inside if you don't open door. If there's something from outside affecting you within, it's because you're open to that. You should not blame anyone from outside because everything around, if they get in, it's because they saw window or open door. Easy.

### Humanity as One Organism: Symbiosis

Other hand, what we understand: our society or civilization is thinking humans are individuals walking around planet, they don't have anything common. But when you look from outside, planet is just one, is one cell.

We humans are part of this body. We're not outside from others' problems. Everything that happens to world is happening to us. This is how biology works. We're all same cell, same organism. We share constantly same information.

Sometimes when there's group of people with conflict or disease, suddenly that disease goes to me and I say, "But why? If I'm really balanced, worked in everything, I'm perfect. Why I got ill?"

Well, this you call symbiosis. By symbiosis, we understand: organism finds there's organ or part of self that has lot of power, vibrating very high. Other parts very low. It distributes energy. This one that has tools can help other ones to rise up.

If you're so balanced, maybe you'll know how to handle it. That's easy. Let's symbiosis. We're all same body. We all work together. This is why when you're balanced, you're helping others to clean things they cannot because we're same cell, same body. We work all together.

We should not think like individuals separated from each other.

### 2020: Earth's Disease

2020 is one of most difficult years we're having because we've been in disease. But I'm not talking about virus. I'm talking about planet stopping.

If disease is to stop, humanity has been stopped during quarantine. Quarantine is process you recognize as process of stopping.

In disease, body stops itself. Sadly, is moment when you have opportunity to think about: Why I had this reaction? Why I came so far to live this? Why I end up being like that?

Moment when you have to think about all things we've done. 2020 is moment where Earth stood still. Earth is having disease—it's sick. Because lot of cells (aware cells, which are humans) are all standing by, don't know what to do.

Problem we have this year is not COVID. Problem has been last 2,500 years. Now we're like this. We have to start thinking about what we've done 2,000 years ago to be like this today. Contemplation.

You have to apply it to your own life and to planet.

## Practice: Sacral Chakra Activation

**Preparation:**
- Comfortable position
- Stretch body, massage, warm
- Let weight fall, relax, focus breathing

**Wave Movement:**

1-18. Complete body activation sequence

**Sacral Work:**

19. Pay attention to higher self above you
20. Help descend through crown, third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacral (all around waist, intestines, belly button, uterus)
21. With both hands, two fingers each hand, massage softly around waist toward kidneys, all around belly button
22. At height of intestines, massage in circles clockwise
23. Perceive this opening like portal through where all sacral energy and light coming through

**Integration:**

24. Relax hands, allow perceive sensations at height of intestines
25. Vibrate: SSfanu
26. State: "I am evolution in constant expansion" (repeat)
27. Breathe consciousness throughout all joints (portals) going through all body
28. Stretch, warm, massage throughout all portals of joints
29. Return here now, open eyes

**Closing:** Drink lots of water, rest to assimilate. Feel each other in network.

## Key Insights

1. Disease (dis-ease) means uncomfortable, taken out of comfortable position
2. Infirmary means standing still—not moving forward
3. Disease is energy stopped, accumulated without knowing how to flow
4. Cells store information from past, family tree—disease expresses ancestral conflicts
5. Disease is not problem itself; it's effect/consequence calling attention to cause
6. Cure is short-term (someone else taking care of you), healing is long-term (you ordering your own energy)
7. Sanity (healing) means putting order on things, balancing yourself
8. Disease begins healing process—tells you where energy is stuck
9. Nothing from outside enters unless you open door (window, opening)
10. Humanity is one organism—we're cells of Earth body
11. Symbiosis: balanced people help distribute energy to those struggling
12. We're not separate individuals—we're same cell sharing information
13. 2020's quarantine = Earth standing still, diseased, giving us contemplation moment
14. Problem isn't COVID—it's 2,500 years of patterns leading to this
15. Contemplation is opportunity to understand why we're here, what we've done

## Integration

**Daily:** When illness appears, ask: "What is this calling my attention to? What energy is stuck?" Don't just seek cure—seek cause.

**Weekly:** Sacral chakra practice, massage around waist/intestines. Feel energy stored there from past, family tree. Allow it to move.

**Monthly:** Identify one area where you're "standing still" (rigid pattern, accumulated energy). What needs to flow to transform this?

**Ongoing:** Remember: when you're balanced and others struggle, that's symbiosis—distribute your energy to help whole organism (humanity) rise. We're one body.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If disease is effect, how do I find cause?**
A: Symptoms tell story. Where is energy stuck? What ancestral pattern (family tree) might this express? Disease calls attention to deeper conflict needing acknowledgment.

**Q: Why is cure short-term but healing long-term?**
A: Cure = someone else takes care of you (relieves symptoms). When they stop, you're same as before. Healing = you learn to order your own energy (addresses cause). This takes time but transforms.

**Q: If nothing enters without open door, am I to blame for getting sick?**
A: Not blame—awareness. You opened door (consciously or unconsciously). Understanding why helps close it or consciously choose what enters.

**Q: How does symbiosis work with disease?**
A: When you're balanced (high vibration), organism (humanity) may send you disease from others who can't handle it. You have tools they don't. You help clean for whole body.

**Q: Does this mean I should accept disease and not seek treatment?**
A: No. Seek treatment (cure for relief), but also do deeper work (healing by understanding cause). Both have place—cure for moment, healing for transformation.

**Q: What if I can't find cause in my life?**
A: Look to family tree. Cells store ancestral information. You may be expressing conflict from generations back. Not your fault, but your opportunity to heal lineage.

**Q: Why is 2020 Earth's disease?**
A: Planet stood still (quarantine). Humanity (Earth's cells) stopped, don't know what to do. Disease calls attention to 2,500 years of patterns. Contemplation moment to understand how we got here.

**Q: How do I heal without knowing full cause?**
A: Begin ordering energy. Put things where they belong. Release what you don't need. Create space for new. Healing is process—you don't need full map to start walking.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching reveals disease not as enemy but as messenger calling attention to stuck energy, ancestral patterns, deeper conflicts. Your sacral chakra—where energy generates creation of your body—is where past (cells storing family tree information) meets present (your chance to transform patterns).

When you see disease, you're seeing effect. Cure addresses effect temporarily. Healing addresses cause permanently. One relieves symptoms (others taking care of you); other transforms root (you ordering your own energy). Both have value, but only healing creates lasting change.

Humanity is one organism. When you're balanced and others struggle, that's symbiosis—Earth body distributing resources where needed. You're not separate individual; you're cell in planetary organism. What affects whole affects you. What you heal in yourself helps heal collective.

2020 showed us Earth's disease: planet standing still, aware cells (humans) paralyzed, contemplating. Problem isn't virus—it's 2,500 years of patterns culminating in this moment. Quarantine gave us gift: time to stop, think, understand how we got here.

You are evolution in constant expansion when you recognize disease begins healing. When energy stops flowing, disease calls attention. Answer isn't blame (why did I open door?) but understanding (what stuck energy needs movement?). Order your energy. Balance yourself. You heal your body, and in healing yourself, you help heal Earth body we all share.

Sanity is coherence. Health is flow. Disease is opportunity. That's the teaching.
