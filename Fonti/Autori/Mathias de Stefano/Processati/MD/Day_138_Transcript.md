## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So as you see the background , this background means marriage , okay? Because I am in different place because in my room there 's a De sleeping.

So I just have to change space.

## Q&A

So some people were asking , but why is there a problem with weddings? Do you have any problems with weddings and marriage? No , it 's not the personal thing. Maybe you have to ask to the people that came for the trips here in Egypt to explain you.

How it is to live within a wedding.

Okay , so it 's not about the weddings. It 's about to live constantly in one.

So we will begin today with the topic for today , but first I just wanted to tell you that if you see me like , I 'm very low with this sleepy face. It 's because today in the morning we went at 7. 30 a. M.

And inside the pyramid , it was like , I 'm receiving this change of vibration in my body. Like if I have , like if I have lived at the transfusion of blood , so I 'm feeling like changing something.

So I am not tired like , oh , I ca n't , I ca n't stand it anymore. I 'm tired in a way that I 'm changing something within , so I need to rest.

So that 's why I 'm feeling like that.

So the topic for today is live.

So , , live. Let 's go to understand what life is. Live in , in , in the European etymology comes from the word , like , AP. And AP means something that is moving constantly.

That is changing constantly.

So it 's moving. It 's moving ahead. And it speaks about a consistency.

Something that is moving constantly.

So that 's why life is related with a constant movement.

So speaking about something that is constantly moving , we have to remember something that we spoke so many times in these alignments , which is that the universe is only one thing vibrating at , in waves of vibration , waves of vibration , like an ocean.

So it 's only one thing vibrating.

So acknowledging this , we can see that the universe is a wave of vibration. And this wave of vibration means that the universe is only one thing moving constantly. And this movement is what we call life.

So life is basically the whole universe. Life is not something attached to an organic beam , like we are , like the plants , like the animals. Life is the constant movement that even the atoms had when they violate , the mountains , the planets , everything that is moving by rating is life.

Another thing that we can understand from this wave is that this wave that is vibrating is constant.

So the movement of the universe is constant. It 's permanent.

So this is why , this is why life is eternal. Eternal life means a constant movement.

Okay?

So that 's the meaning of eternal life. When we speak about eternal life , usually we make this mistake that we believe with think that , to have eternal life is to attach to this shape , to this body , and to leave eternally with this shape. But this is not eternal life. This is another kind of death because you get stuck in one shape.

So you 're not free.

So the eternal life is when you are allowing yourself to move , to transform , to express in different shapes , to live through the eternity. We accomplish to live the eternal life when we realize that everything is the life , and we are just focusing in one conscience aspect that is referring to itself in a specific shape , in a specific moment. And that 's it.

Okay? It 's the consciousness watching itself in a specific moment. Inside this huge creation.

So if we are going to talk about eternal life , the best way to understand how it works is by receiving the universe as a fit , the universe as a fit is a huge ocean.

So picture that the universe is life in the universe is this big ocean. And imagine that the tiny waves that are created on the top of this , on the surface of this ocean , are the little moments of acknowledging , of awareness.

Remember something that we have spoken before in some other videos. The ocean is like the subconscious. Then we have the hot and cold currents in the ocean , which is the unconscious. And then we have this tiny moments like these tiny waves of the ocean that are the conscious in the surface.

Now picture how many of those tiny waves of consciousness we have in each wave of the entire ocean is impossible to come them. They are infinite.

The reason why it 's impossible to come them is because immediately when they appear , they start to disappear. And then they appear again and disappear immediately.

So it 's impossible to count them. It 's infinite.

So now imagine that we can just take one wave.

So this wave will start below going up and then we go down again.

So when it goes up , it 's coming from the unconscious and the subconscious. And then it reach the higher point of this wave where it becomes conscious. And then starts to go down again , pushing this strength that it took towards the subconscious again to push the next wave.

So this moment of awareness is what we call life. One life and then I die. And then I go up again and then I go down again up life there and so on. We call this highs and lows life and death.

So we have one life and another life and another life. But these lives are concepts because the ocean is the life.

So there is no lies by itself. The ocean is life.

So what is this life? They are just the moments of awareness of the life. Is the life itself experiencing an acknowledging a conscious aspect of itself? That 's a life.

So that 's why the great ocean contains all the lives , all the lives because basically the ocean is life. The ocean is the life. No acknowledging that life is the ocean. The ocean is life.

This means that everything is basically the life itself.

So we are just experiencing different lives , different connections. But it 's only one eternal life.

So all the life is eternal. It does n't matter the shape it has. It 's all water. Water is eternal.

So this means that it does n't matter which shapes the water will take. In evolution it will always be water.

So if everything is water is the life in this explanation , just think about this. Water can take the shape of anything.

So water can leave through any shape. But the truth is only the water.

So imagine ourselves. We are 70 % water in our bodies. We are water. But the plants are also made up with 80 % of water.

The animals 70 % of water.

So we are all water in different shapes.

So if everything that exists with life is because of water.

So the eternal life exists in water , not in the human shape. Water is the life , is the key of life.

So in this concept of water in the matter , humans , we are just water in a different shape. Trace are just water in a different shape.

So that 's it.

So when we say that we are different beings interacting each other , it 's not really different beings. It 's only one being that is called water interacting with itself in different shapes.

So I do n't know if you have heard this , but did you know that if you take a class of water or you are just drinking water right now? The same water you are drinking right now is exactly the same water that some day 70 million years ago have been drinking by a dinosaur.

So when we think about this , it 's very interesting because water is not something that just appears when it rains. Water is a cycle is constantly repeating since the first moment of creation in this plant.

So basically we are not humans with water. We are water on the shape of humans because water is everything that it has life.

So how picture this that if I am made of water and this same water that I have within is the same water that the dinosaur drank some day.

So if water is memory and holds memory.

So within me I also have some patterns and information from the dinosaur. This means that if water takes the information of everything of everybody that it has ever gone through , this means that in my body , I also have the information of every being that have taken this water before. And this is how we can understand now what a past life means.

So if water has been living through so many beings in history , this means that all the water that I have inside , some day have lived within people through history.

So this is when you have that information within from the past life.

Today in the blog I wrote , how can we connect with all those lives? In order to understand what I wrote in the blog about the different ways of remembering lives. We have to remember the cycle of water. We all remember that for sure.

So from an ocean , the steam , the gases start to go up and they create the clouds and the clouds flies over through the atmosphere. And they reach the high mountains , they get frozen.

So they condense into drops of water or freezing into snowflakes and snowflakes create snow. And then it joins together to create ice and the ice starts to melt , create streams and these streams create small rivers. And these rivers start to be bigger rivers and they all go to different lakes and lagoons. And they end up in base and base into , into seas and the seas come back into an ocean.

And the cycle starts again. And during all that process , many animals , humans , plants , they drank this water and they became the water.

So let 's do this poetic comparison if we may say.

So the first one that we are going to see is this tiny stream , the river that comes from the mountains going down. And it will be narrow and will be determined by the shape of the valleys.

So unless something geological changes , the stream will be always the same.

So the river will have the destiny , okay , will be determined by its own destiny to move the water through the same places once and again.

So this stream explains the path that each one of our souls are taking in the universe. This means that we are conditioned by our soul to follow one river. We are conditioned by that river.

So this is related with our own soul.

So our soul starts this path through the river and it will be determined by the geography , by the fauna , the flora , the weather conditions , the region where I am. It will be determined by just that , okay.

So every time my soul will be related to the path of that stream of that river. This is the path of the soul.

So the soul follows this stream of the river remembering that in different moments of the river , the geography was different.

So I can remember the geography through where I was living.

So that 's the past lives , our own past lives , okay , which means for example for myself , I remember my past lives.

So remembering my past lives means that in a conceptual way symbolic way , I would say I remember that when we when I was going into this valley , I was born in Norway. I remember that in the moment when I felt this waterfall , I was born in Egypt , two or a thousand years ago.

So it 's not literal this , what I 'm saying is just the concept of it , okay.

So it means that I was following a path.

So that 's why I am connected to this specific lives , in specific places , okay. I hope this analogy is clear to understand how you connect.

So now comes the moment when it 's kind of the next level. This means that there is a moment when the river ends up in a lake and this lake has a lot of water. And this water comes from different other streams , which are different people , different souls , having their own lives , their own paths through existence. But all together they end up in one lake mixing the waters.

So the water now is like kind of stuck all together or mixed. And that 's what we call the plan , that 's what we call the tree of the general logical tree , the tree of our own family.

So our genetics , the information within ourselves , all the ancestors from the very beginning of our ourselves , they are connected in this lake.

So we are not a different being from our family. We are only one being , one being , which is a lake all together. Yes.

So each one of us is just one expression of this lake.

So now we can see that there are one of those rivers that arrived to this moment that says , I have to keep moving. I ca n't stay here in this clan constantly trapped in the same situation.

So what this water does is to remember that it has to keep moving. It has to keep following towards the sea.

So that 's the moment when the lake finds a path to create a new river towards the ocean. And that new river would be like this person of the family that says , I have to help all of my family to transcend this lake.

So we could move forward.

So it takes all the energy of the lake , all information from the lake and opens the lake into a new river , living the transcendence of this path towards the ocean.

So when this person arrives to the ocean , suddenly it relies that there 's no only one reality of the past life. There 's no only one river coming from the past life. There 's no only one lake with one family that I have to work with through history. That in the ocean ends every river and every lake of the universe.

All of them end up in the sea , creating the oceans.

So that 's the moment when I realize that I am not only my past lives and my family , three of life. But I am the whole.

So I can remember the universe. I can remember the lives of every planet that is around the cosmos. Every comment in every planet with water , I can feel and remember every part of the universe with life.

So I recognize that I just took one path. But all the paths are together. And when I want to connect and unite , all this big ocean of cosmic memory , I want to go to eat the clouds , I want to go to the mountain , I want to be snowy and I start to die. If that is , I can imagine the Conscience.

And when I am in the ocean , after a while , I do exactly the same as before. I evaporated , go up into the clouds , I go to the mountains , come back to be ice , snow , and then create a new stream and cycle starts again.

So I hope that today we can understand that there is no one life. There is no past lives. There is no parallel lives. There is no ancestral lives that everything is only one life experiencing expressing in different shapes.

This is why the masters used to remind us , I am the life. This is why it is weird to say , my life , your life , my past life , because there is no mine or different lives. The only thing that exists is only one life. That is why we have to remind us , I am life.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is the statement for today is I am the legacy of my ancestors. The goal for today is the color Cyan. Increasing the vibration of the wavelength , we see the beautiful color of the sky , from which it is light blue color.

It is nothing more than the solar light composing when it bounces in a short and fast wavelength in the gases of the atmosphere , like oxygen , nitrogen and argon. This has rotated our subconscious with the idea that the divine has the celestial color. That is how you kill the magic about the celestial beings.

So that is why we see that color just because of gases reflecting photons. Given the magic since 1987.

So we are all together. I think that if me myself would n't be able to have these connections and to perceive other dimensions naturally , I would be my greatest enemy because I usually kill all the the magic on the connection and all these things.

So let 's go to the lineman. I see it comfortable and I start to focus on my breathing. I connect with the memory of a mother and father taking a child to the coast to the sea. I feel the nature around.

I accompany this family. I recognize being this kid , the child. Having the hand of my dad and with my other hand , having the hand of my mother. Both of them take me to the shore to take my first steps in the sand , touching the water of the sea.

I can feel the water in my feet covering my legs until my key , my knees. My mother gets closer to me in the water , taking the water of the sea with her hands. Putting it on my own hands , getting myself wet. As she says , in this water , lead all our ancestors.

My dad also came closer and pointing to the horizon reminded me from there is where our ancestors have come and is there. Where our future ones will head to. Take a deep breath. Take the water and wash your face with it.

Recognize the water. And I remember all the path of the water. I go up a side sea of clouds dropping the water in the rain. Expanding from above the sea from the Mediterranean.

I can see from the clouds how the humans start to walk brave , creating path along the rivers and the shores of the seas. Expanding from Middle East to Turkey in Europe. From the Share to the entire Africa to the east , the expand in Asia crossing the carcasses to the steps of Russia. Towards the south across to Australia from the north in Siberia , heading to the Americans reaching Patagonia.

I can see every village , every human , my ancestors and future ones connecting this links in the rivers and the shores. Building and being connected by the water sharing the life. And I unite all those in this life. I unite all those in this life.

I am the legacy of my ancestors. I am the legacy of my ancestors. And now I can see all of them. I can see the life that I am.

I see I see I see. I see the life that I am. I see the life that I am. I see the life that I am.

I am life. I see the life that I am. I see the life that I am. I see the life that I am.

I see the life that I am. I see it tomorrow at the same time.
