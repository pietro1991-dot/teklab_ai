## Introduction

Hello everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening , how are you? I hope that all of you are okay and if you are not okay so maybe you have done something.

So the love resonance , I feel myself like waiting for all of you to see it. Like if we are in the classroom but I have no idea what you are doing.

So it 's good to know that you are here listening because it 's impossible if I could , if I have to check if all of you are in the classroom. All of you are already here because of course it 's like we are too many and I think that because otherwise it would be weird to speak alone here every day. My little part , which is my son Leo is very thankful that we are too many because of course that for sure my ego would say if we are only three , you would say oh , I do n't know what to do , what to talk and by my rising capricorn is constantly saying there are too many people. I do n't know what to say , I hope I do n't see the faces.

So it 's good that I did n't see your faces.

So yesterday in the alignment that around me there was like this powerful serious guy that he was like supervising the thing. And it was very centered on the line and it was like if well , very serious person.

So I was in the middle of it 's energy when I was speaking so I got very also serious.

So that 's why maybe yesterday was weird.

So because of him. I say it 's Spanish. If you get inside the water , you get wet.

So I kind of got it 's energy but I have no idea who it was.

So let 's go to the topic for today , which when I was speaking Spanish , I just forgot what it was.

So that 's the level for today. Projects. Let 's go first to understand the technology of the word project. Project comes from the lighting concepts of the means to move ahead.

To move ahead. Go move forward. Then Yakuza re the means to throw something away. And the word use that is the attribute is a suffix that represents the attribute they objected.

So projects means that thing that is thrown ahead.

So this way through the etymology is how we can understand the concept of what is a project. A project is not something you are having right now is something that you are thinking of accomplishing in the future. A heck.

So the idea of a project means something that is born in my concept , in my mind , my ideas. But I am willing to manifest in a physical form in a short or long period of time.

So throughout our lives we all are living projecting projects. We are all doing projects.

Some of them are our own projects , but mostly we are living the projects of others.

So of course that for our lives we have different kinds of projects. We have tiny projects like for example cooking something. For some people to cook something to eat is a project.

So that is a good project because you have an idea of what it is going to be.

So you can enjoy that. And of course there are other kinds of projects like for example saving the rainforests of Amazon.

So imagine that in that project you need many people organizations and you are working with governments or companies that are going against them. Or I do n't know saving animals and plants and many people and so on.

So that is a really big project. But there are projects anyway to cook something or to save the Amazon is is the same talking about concepts of projects. And in between we have many different kind of projects. For example this what we are doing here the project is I am.

My project I projected this. The project I am and you are enjoying this project at least one hour and a half every day. A project can be something from only one person when you yourself project something ahead to do something. But most of the people usually they do n't project from themselves but they add themselves to the projection of other people to the projects of other people.

For example when we live in one place any place a country. We are. We are following a project which is a national project like we are following the projects of the government we are following the project of the nation.

So. The projects are related to. The process of going towards. Our.

Purpose because purpose. Comes from the word pro opposite which is that thing that is put already there.

So I am heading to and the way I go to is the project. Whenever we feel that we have a project. A purpose in our life we all need to have a project to get into. That goal.

That purpose.

So the word project is very. Useful today. Bigger and use today because. In our world today we are ruled by the concept of the capitalism and in capitalism.

The capitalism is always looking for success.

So it is always trying to go to move forward and to reach the success of the next level. That is why we ourselves are constantly trying to project. A jet ourselves into the next level.

So the word project means to keep going to move forward. That is why everyone today will face this concept of what is your. Your project of life your life project what is. What are your projects what are you working on you know because everything is about to move and that 's why it also went into the.

Spirituality when we are willing to get enlightened. We are like kind of running to see who gets faster , who gets the success , the success. To reach the enlightenment first. That 's also a project that we are taking in see.

How we are going to make it.

So this is why we are constantly speaking about projects. But from where a project is coming from.

So this concept which is a known. No. Project is a known. Comes from the concept of pro-yepteo.

That means for us projection. Which is the origin of the word. The action of throwing something ahead.

So a project is originated by a projection. From where a projection come from. Well , the projection comes from the perception. What means what perception means.

The perception is the. The ability to. Consider. The world around.

And the distances of this world. Perception. The perception. The ability to take.

To perceive. To conceive the things outside. Creates by experiences. Where we call.

Pre conception. Pre conception.

So what is the pre conception. Is something that by experience. I achieved. By the.

Perception.

Okay.

So everything that my mind perceives from the outside. Turns within me in my own mind. As a pre concept. A pre conception.

From this. Pre concepts that I already took. This pre concepts.

Now I am going to perceive. I need space.

So what what this means. That my inner world. Will be conditioned by all the experience. Of.

My. My preconceptions.

So. My inner world will be conditioned by the preconceptions. That I had experience. In my time.

When my brain perceives.

Something outside. That is. Position. I had that we call.

Per. Per.

So my mind. We 'll try to reach. Pre concepts. Of how to get there.

My inner world. In order to reach the purpose. A heck. We 'll try to throw myself from the place where I find me.

And find myself. To reach the purpose. And the way I throw myself. It 's by the word.

Bro. Jet. Bro. Jet.

Bro. Jet.

So now I have here a horrible person. Hmm.

So here I have. A purpose. Perfect. Hmm.

This person has many experiences behind. Like an English. Keep. Kept.

Is from. Con. Set. Con.

Set. Kept. Keep. Is the same word.

Which is something that you keep. But this is something from before that I took that I catch for me before. Hmm. And here I have an eye.

It 's looking forward to the purpose. And that 's what we call. Per. Set.

Shun. Per. Set. Yes.

Is. This future. Per. Is.

Future.

So this means. Four. Four. And what?

Exactly the same. Kept. To. Take.

For you.

Okay. To take for you. The. The.

Per. Step. Is the one that. Looks forward to something to keep.

Which is. But this. And. That.

On. Pro. Post. Post.

Post. Post.

Something that is. Put. I have. But the way in which it arrives here is by understanding that this.

That is here. It 's similar to all the boxes that I saw before. That 's a pretty concept. Hmm.

Can you get this. As this one went to this point and this one moved ahead to this other point and so on and so on repeating ones and again same thing , this person here in the present we have to do the same jumping ahead in a new preconception , a perception and a new perception to arrive to the purpose. This is the first project or project which is to throw myself ahead.

So this purpose here will be observed by my own perception and my perception will be conditioned by all my pre-conceived things experienced.

So this means that when I have to walk ahead towards my purpose , it does n't mean that my projects will be something outside of me. This means that my projects will be myself moving forward and myself is all this preconceived ideas.

So my projects will be all conditioned by my pre-conceived perceptions. Let 's go to a simple way of seeing things. Usually what we believe is that the future is ahead because we can see ahead and move and the past is behind because I come from there. Have you ever thought why the future is ahead and why we say we are moving forward , we are going ahead.

The future is ahead in the horizon. This is just because of biology. It 's not true. The future is anywhere.

It 's a concept.

So the future can not be ahead. The future is just conceived ahead because we have the eyes , the nose , the mouth , the feet , the hands , everything heading ahead. And that 's why we position the future ahead because we are going to the horizon ahead. But there 's no future ahead.

It 's just our idea. And because we are moving forward in order to go to the horizon , leaving the place where we have been.

So we perceive that the past is behind.

So in our point of view , we have the past pushing us and we go to the future. But in the ancient point of view , I do n't know if you have the opportunity to to see about ancient cultures , but usually they believe that the past is ahead coming to me. And the future is behind pushing me.

So from the point of view of the ancient ones , the past is in front because I saw the past. My eyes saw everything that happened.

So I can also sit with my ancestors with my grandmother , my grandfather , and so on , and speak to them about the past. I can touch the past , I can speak with the past to their eyes.

So that 's why the past is in front because it can come towards me to be discovered by my eyes. For the ancient cultures , the future is behind because you can not see it. You have no idea how it is going to be.

So you do n't see it coming. The future you do n't see it coming is coming. But you only have one thing about the future that it will push you forward for sure. And where is the future pushing you to the past?

Have you noticed that everything that you do , everything that we are doing is basically to try to understand who we are , not who will be , who are we going to be? We are constantly healing the past , trying to find out who are we. It 's another concept , another way to see it. It 's just another way , but I guess it 's better than this one.

So let 's do it , exactly the same as we did in the other drawing that I did before. We have here the pre-concepts and here we have the projects. I will erase this. My pre-concepts are always talking about my future , never about my past.

To my pre-concepts , my preconceptions for they does n't matter what happened before. They , everything that they take care of is about what is going to happen. Expectations , preconceptions , generate expectations.

So what expectation means , X means to go outside , to wait , to wait , which is hope. Expectations are preconcepts that are constantly telling to me , I hope this is going to be like this. I hope this happened. Always talking about the future.

So in front , now ahead , I have the past , which is the projects that I have. And the projects will bring me at correspondence. What is a correspondence? It 's an answer , a response that is shared.

Co is with shared with someone. And correspondence means response.

So an answer.

## Q&A

So I make a question and I would have an answer. The law of correspondence.

So what all of this here in this side of the board means that my projects and my purpose are talking about my past , not about my future. Because the projections and the purposes are seen by my perception and my perception is through the preconceptions of the past.

So when I question myself about my purposes and my projections and my projects in life , they are the ones that will tell me about my past , about who I was , about what are my preconceptions. All ready in our little minds.

So when you are going to see your project in front of you , if you pay attention to this , you will see the past , you will see what you have done , what are you projecting from the past. For example , this project , the I am and connecting the network of the planet. This is 12,000 years ago. I am projecting ahead in the future , something that is from 12,000 years ago.

It 's not something for the future , something that I project from the past.

So why are we doing this? Because our mind says you had a mean able to solve the past.

So that 's why my projects in front of me are ahead. Are all the things that I could n't accomplish in the past , that my mind says , hey , this is what you have to solve now.

So as fast you run ahead towards the future , the closest you get to the past. When do you think you will be connected with the future? There 's only one way to connect with the future. There 's only one thing that you can do if the future is behind.

And you can upset. The only thing that you can do is to close your eyes and trust.

## Guided Meditation

So is it in the moment when I close my eyes and mediate? Live in a way the expectations of my projects when I close my eyes and I trust when the future comes and helps me to hold it.

So to the future you will never arrive to the future by making strength ahead. You get to the future by relaxing and trusting.

## Daily Practice Elements

So now the task is to try to look into your projects and watch carefully to them so you can see your past and ask yourself , what is what I am projecting to the world for myself? I am sincere with what I project. Let 's go to the moment. The statement for today is I am the home of consciousness.

The code for today is pulse connected within the rhythm law. The cosmic breathing generates echoes that are perceived as pulses or hard beatings. This pulses are fractalized into thousands , millions like an infinite gear of universal clocks. Everything in the universe pulses , light with tides of the seed or the tons of the heart.

That pulse is where it keeps together all the times and spaces in harmony. The bass line of the song without noticing the notes , melodies and rhythms in our brain. Just before we start. It 's been a lot of codes or information.

Maybe this has been like a breaking for some minds.

So do n't try to accept or understand that now. Do n't think about it. If you do n't get it , if you ca n't understand it , do n't push your mind to try to do it. Just let it go flow.

Whenever it is the moment you will get it or you will see another perception. The word. We are not going to erase the videos so you can see it whenever you want.

So we sit comfortable and we close the eyes. Focus in the breathing. With deep breathing I move my body until I find the right position. Take the breath.

Being aware of the environment I finally self in. Remove. With my imagination I start to decide is surrounding. A salaries dark night , darker , darker until I can see this stars above me.

The silence of the stars , I ca n't perceive that I am seated on the ground in the middle of nature in front of a sacred fire. I can see the light of this fire and the heat in my face , my chest and my hands. I can perceive the movement of the flames like a snake. With different tones of the color orange , yellow , red.

## Q&A

I become aware that I am not alone , that there are more people , others around the fire , like we did in ancient times , like our ancestors did. In this holy circle , I can now see the faces of the people around , recognize them. That I am here in this circle , to ask for advice in the projects of my life. I came to ask advice to the elders and how to move forward to create my projects.

I find the round around the fire , all the people that I have been involved with in projects , all these people that I will be involved in many others. Watching the faces of all these people , expecting for the help of the elders , I ask myself and to the fire , what are my projects , what are my projects in my life , I am sincere in what I project. I have thought of one thing and I have seen how I look for a person in different spaces. With my vibration , I start to bring the arm to the answers from this fire towards my heart.

With my vibration , I start to bring the arm to the answer from this fire towards my heart. While observing directly to the fire , without any charge of heat , I let all of this conscious ideas to come through me through the light of my own consciousness. I recognize that every projection that I see in the fire , every project that I watch ahead is just an extension of myself of my past of everything that I have been.

So I recognize I am my project. I recognize that this circle is my home. This is the place where I can come to look for advice for my elders and others are here to show me whose clarity my consciousness. I am the home of consciousness.

I am the home of consciousness. I extend my hands to the fire and I take with my hands all this clarity and consciousness and bring it up physically towards my heart as I take to the breath. The consciousness of my projects lives now within my soul , within my being. I am my project and I use it.

Feeling this heat in your heart , each one in your own time , come back here and now. Thank you everybody for being there and as always see you tomorrow at the same time.
