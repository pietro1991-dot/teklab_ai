## Summary

Day 162 reveals the profound relationship between **Projects, Purpose, Perception, and the Past**. A project is "that thing that is thrown ahead"—but the teaching turns conventional understanding upside down. Our projects are not about the future at all; they are **projections of the past**. Every project we create comes from our **preconceptions** (past experiences), which condition our **perception**, which then generates **expectations** about the future. The ancient view is presented: the **past is in front** (because we can see it, touch it, speak to our ancestors about it) and the **future is behind** (because we cannot see it coming—it pushes us forward). Projects and purposes ask us about our past—what we couldn't accomplish before, what patterns we're repeating. The faster we run toward the "future," the closer we get to solving the past. The only way to truly connect with the future is to **close your eyes, meditate, and trust**—letting go of expectations and projects. You will never arrive at the future by making strength ahead; you get to the future by **relaxing and trusting**. Projects are extensions of ourselves, so the question becomes: "Am I sincere in what I project?" This day is a profound meditation on how everything we think is forward-looking is actually backward-facing.

## Key Concepts

### Etymology and Definition
- **Project:** Latin "pro" (to move ahead/forward) + "iectus/iacere" (to throw) + "us" (attribute suffix)
- **Projects = "that thing that is thrown ahead"**
- Born in concept/mind/ideas, willing to manifest in physical form in short or long period of time
- Not something you have right now, but something you're thinking of accomplishing in the future

### Projects Throughout Our Lives
- We all live projecting projects
- Some are our own projects, but **mostly we are living the projects of others**
- Different scales: tiny projects (cooking something) to massive projects (saving the Amazon rainforest)
- The "I Am" project itself is Matias's project that others are enjoying for 1.5 hours daily
- Projects can be individual (one person projecting) or collective (adding yourself to others' projects)

### Living in Others' Projects
- When we live in a place/country, we follow a **national project** (government/nation project)
- Most people don't project from themselves—they add themselves to others' projections
- Example: Republic education, cultural systems, societal structures

### Projects vs. Purpose
- **Purpose:** "pro" (ahead) + "positus" (put) = "that thing that is put already there"
- Purpose is the destination you're heading toward
- **Project** is the way you go toward the purpose
- Whenever we feel we have a purpose in life, we need a project to get to that goal

### Projects and Capitalism
- The word "project" is very useful today because we live under capitalism
- Capitalism is always looking for **success**, trying to move forward and reach the next level
- We constantly try to "project ourselves into the next level"
- Project means **to keep going, to move forward**
- Even spirituality has become capitalist: running to see who gets enlightened faster, competing for "success" at enlightenment

### The Origin Chain: Projection → Perception → Preconception

**Perception:**
- The ability to consider the world around and the distances of this world
- The ability to perceive, to conceive things outside
- Created by experiences

**Preconception:**
- Something achieved by experience through perception
- Everything the mind perceives from outside turns within as a **preconception**
- From preconceptions already taken, we now perceive space and future

**Key Point:** **Inner world is conditioned by all experiences/preconceptions**

When the brain perceives something outside (position we call "purpose"), the mind tries to reach preconceptions of how to get there. The way we throw ourselves from where we are toward the purpose is called **projection**.

### The Conventional View (Challenged)
- **Future = ahead** (because we have eyes, nose, mouth, feet, hands heading ahead)
- **Past = behind** (because we come from there, leaving the place where we've been)
- We perceive: past pushing us → we go to the future
- But this is just biology, not truth—**the future can be anywhere, it's a concept**

### The Ancient View (True Understanding)
**Past = In Front:**
- We **saw** the past with our eyes
- We can sit with ancestors (grandmother, grandfather) and speak about the past
- We can **touch the past**, speak with it, see it with our eyes
- The past comes toward us to be discovered by our eyes

**Future = Behind:**
- We **cannot see** the future
- We have no idea how it's going to be
- The future you don't see coming—it's coming, but unseen
- The only thing about the future: **it will push you forward for sure**

**Where does the future push you? To the past.**

### The Revolutionary Insight
Everything we do is basically trying to **understand who we are**, not who we will be. We are constantly **healing the past**, trying to find out who we are—not who we're going to be.

**Diagram Explanation:**
- **Ahead (Front) = Projects and Purpose** → These reveal the PAST
- **Behind = Future** → Unseen, pushing us forward
- **Preconceptions = Always about the future** (expectations)
- **Projects/Purpose = Always about the past** (what perception sees through past preconceptions)

### Expectations
- **Expectation:** "ex" (to go outside) + "spectare" (to wait/hope)
- Preconceptions generate expectations
- Expectations are preconceptions constantly saying: "I hope this is going to be like this"
- Always talking about the future
- But they come from the past

### Correspondence (Answer to Questions)
- **Correspondence:** "co" (with/shared) + "respondence" (response/answer)
- A question receives an answer
- Law of Correspondence: I make a question, I have an answer
- Projects/purposes are the questions; correspondence is the answer

### Projects Reveal the Past
- Projects and purposes are seen by our **perception**
- Perception is through **preconceptions of the past**
- When you question yourself about purposes and projects, **they tell you about your past**
- They tell you about **who you were**, what your preconceptions are already in your mind
- When you see your project in front of you, you see **what you have done**, what you're projecting from the past

**Matias's Example:**
The "I Am" project of connecting the network of the planet is 12,000 years ago. He's projecting ahead into the future something from 12,000 years ago—not something for the future, but from the past.

### Why We Do This
- Our mind says: "You had a mission, you weren't able to solve the past"
- Projects ahead are **all the things we couldn't accomplish in the past**
- The mind says: "Hey, this is what you have to solve now"
- **As fast as you run ahead toward the future, the closer you get to the past**

### The Only Way to Connect with the Future
**There is only one way to connect with the future:**

If the future is behind and you can't see it, the only thing you can do is:

**Close your eyes and trust.**

- In the moment you close your eyes and meditate
- Live without the expectations of your projects
- **Close your eyes and trust** → the future comes and helps you to hold it
- **You will never arrive to the future by making strength ahead**
- **You get to the future by relaxing and trusting**

## Teaching Points

1. **Projects are past-facing, not future-facing** - They reveal what we couldn't accomplish before
2. **Etymology reveals truth** - "Thrown ahead" seems future-oriented, but it's a projection of preconceptions (past)
3. **Most projects are not ours** - We live in others' projects (national, cultural, systemic)
4. **Capitalism drives project obsession** - Success culture = constant forward movement = spiritual competition
5. **Perception chain** - Experience → Preconception → Perception → Expectation → Project
6. **Inner world is conditioned by past** - All preconceptions from experiences shape how we perceive space/future
7. **Biology creates illusion** - We think future is ahead only because our body faces forward
8. **Ancient wisdom** - Past is in front (visible, touchable), future is behind (invisible, pushing)
9. **Healing, not becoming** - We constantly try to understand who we are, not who we will be
10. **Fast running = past solving** - The faster you run ahead, the closer you get to solving the past
11. **Future requires trust** - You cannot reach the future by force; only by closing your eyes and trusting
12. **Sincere projection** - The task is to look at your projects and see your past honestly

## Questions for Reflection

1. **What are my projects in my life?** - List them honestly
2. **Am I sincere in what I project?** - Do my projects truly represent what I want, or am I living others' projects?
3. **What past experiences are my projects revealing?** - Look carefully at each project—what preconception from your past is being projected?
4. **Am I running toward the future or solving the past?** - Which projects are actually attempts to solve/complete something from before?

## Alignment Practice

**Setup:**
- Sit comfortably, close your eyes
- Deep breathing, moving body until finding right position
- Become aware of the environment

**Visualization:**
1. **Night descends** - With imagination, the environment becomes a dark night, darker until you see stars above
2. **Sacred fire** - Seated on the ground in nature, in front of a sacred fire
3. **Feel the fire** - Light and heat on face, chest, hands; flames moving like a snake (orange, yellow, red tones)
4. **Circle of ancestors** - Not alone; others around the fire like ancient times, like our ancestors did
5. **Holy circle** - See the faces of people around, recognize them
6. **Asking for advice** - You came to ask advice from the elders about the projects of your life
7. **Project people** - Around the fire are all the people you've been involved with in projects, and all you will be involved with in many others
8. **Elder wisdom** - Watching faces, expecting help from the elders
9. **Ask the fire** - "What are my projects? What are my projects in my life? Am I sincere in what I project?"
10. **See yourself searching** - You think of one thing and see how you look for a person in different spaces
11. **Vibration brings answers** - Start to bring the answers from the fire toward your heart with your vibration

**Direct Fire Gazing:**
- Observe directly to the fire without charge of heat
- Let all these conscious ideas come through you through the light of your own consciousness
- Recognize: every projection you see in the fire, every project you watch ahead is just **an extension of yourself, of your past, of everything you have been**

**Realization:**
- "I recognize: **I am my project**"
- "I recognize this circle is my home—the place where I can come to look for advice from my elders"
- "Others are here to show me the clarity of my consciousness"

**Affirmation:**
- **"I Am the Home of Conscience"** (repeat three times)

**Closing:**
- Extend hands to the fire
- Take with your hands all this clarity and consciousness
- Bring it physically toward your heart as you breathe
- "The consciousness of my projects lives now within my soul, within my being"
- "I am my project and I use it"
- Feel this heat in your heart
- Each one in your own time, come back here and now

## Cosmic Heart Message

**Code: Pulse**

Connected within the rhythm law, the cosmic breathing generates **echoes** that are perceived as **pulses** or heartbeats. These pulses are fractalized into thousands, millions—like an infinite gear of universal clocks.

**Everything in the universe pulses:** light, tides, seeds, heart tones.

That pulse is what keeps together all the times and spaces in harmony—**the bass line of the song** without noticing the notes, melodies, and rhythms in our brain.

---

## Practical Application

**Daily Practice:**
1. **List your projects** - Write down all current projects (tiny to massive)
2. **Identify ownership** - Which are truly yours? Which are others' projects you've joined?
3. **Trace to the past** - For each project, ask: "What past experience/preconception is this projecting?"
4. **Practice closing your eyes** - When anxious about a project, close your eyes, meditate, and **trust** instead of pushing
5. **Notice running** - When you feel yourself "running toward the future," pause and ask: "What past am I trying to solve?"

**Integration:**
- Don't try to understand everything intellectually right away—let it flow
- Videos remain available for re-watching whenever you're ready
- Use the fire circle meditation when working on projects
- Practice "I Am the Home of Conscience" when making project decisions

**Capricorn Emotional Week:**
Projects are how we **use** emotional links with others. Capricorn asks: "What is this relationship/project useful for?" Today reveals that all projects are ways we use our past to create something ahead—but they're really about **healing and understanding who we are**, not becoming someone new.

**Revolutionary Practice:**
Instead of running ahead with strength, practice **relaxing and trusting**. The future comes when you stop forcing it.
