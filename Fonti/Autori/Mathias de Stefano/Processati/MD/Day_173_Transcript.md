- **Chakra:** `Crown`

## Introduction

Hello everybody , how are you? Morning , good afternoon , and evening. I 'm still trying to find out where to put the light. I hope everyone is fine.

Today , I guess my soul is coming back to the body.

So I 'm still trying to adapt to find the places where to put the things and I 've been trying to adapt to the energy that is around.

## Energy Work

So today , we 'll work with the center of the Throne Chakra , which is education. Just by start , I told you all of you in August last year that some day you will see me just going through some process. And it took six months , but you got it.

So yes.

So just wanted to say thank you to all of you. I 've been reading all the messages that you have left me in the social media and wrote and everything.

So really thank you for everything because of course that beyond this image that I am here kind of teaching in this relationship , master. And to this , this is not really like this. We are each one of us doing our part in this. And that 's why we all have a process to go.

And my part is to be here , explain. But as I saw a myth , the Yes and everything , we are not this , this master with apprentice. We are this kind of family , each one doing what it 's meant for us to do.

So thank you everybody for aiming for sharing and for sending all this good vibes.

So about yesterday , yesterday I was living through many changes. Many things that I did n't expect to have in just a few hours. Because as you know , I 've been six months in the same place. And the last kind of life last half a month.

I 've been in my room , not seeing anybody mostly alone. And after six months being in the same place. I took a nerve plane. I went to boat.

They changed the boat where I was supposed to be. And there was all these chaotic situations and suddenly in the middle I 've been speaking with. With someone that made me see many of the things that I was n't able to work within myself. That brought me this , this thing I did n't work on myself for a few times , for a few months.

So it came up just five minutes before we started the alignment.

So so I could n't help it , help it , I could n't stop it.

So just a reminder because I do n't know if it was able to , because I was crying. Just to make a summary of this to make the point of what I wanted to say is that beyond the concepts of ideas and politics , the parties that we belong to. Believes that we have in the politicians or the different kind of movements of politics that we follow. The most important thing , the most important understanding is that when we see it from the point of view of the consciousness , all that is history.

All that is just history for us.

So that 's what I wrote it as history. And as we go deeper into the past , we can see politics that we have today is born in the concept of government that really means to sail the boat. Basically , that politics is how to learn , is to learn how to roll yourself , how to roll how to sail your own self.

So from now on , the work that we have for the future is to start trying to rule ourselves by sailing our own boat. This is the concept of the most essential politics from the I. M.

So what I said yesterday to that be politics , the concept is how we do politics in our lives , because everything that we do when we 're related with other people is politics all the time.

So we are politicians in our life. We are constantly doing , when we speak , when we relate to each other. And also when we try to put our toll and power over the thinking of other people. When we try to tell them what to believe , what to do , what is the good thing , what is the bad thing , that 's politics.

When I was trying to say yesterday , is that before we start to blame the politicians in the system , we may have to start by watching our own politics. How do we apply politics in our own life? Because politicians are just humans. And they commit the same mistake as every day of our lives.

The only thing is that the politicians are in charge of so many people that you can tell , you can notice those mistakes that we normally do with a few people , but they do much bigger.

So that 's why in concepts and terms of politics , we should not blame the persons we start to prepare the persons inside from the inner point of view. Talking about politics , we will get into education. Because education is one of the things that creates politics. Basically , both of them , politics and the education are born in the same moment , talking about our civilization , which is the basis of our civilization was born in Greece.

Why is this? Because education was what is politically correct. And for the moment of the birth of politics , it was about freedom , how to think properly in your free will.

So education was born to teach us how to think freely. And this is why it 's one of the things that we could n't experiment so much throughout the history.

## Q&A

So the reason why education is not well received in the world is because education is based on the question to reach the knowledge through the doubt. That is the key of education. But in a world that is ruled by hierarchies , education is something really bad for those who want to hold the divine system.

Remember that hierarchy comes from the concept power of the divine.

So let 's understand how we relate religion and politics with education.

Remember that in the religion , the main channels and the priestess , where the ones downloading the information from the hands to the earth.

So they were the ones deciding who was the ruler of the village of the civilization of the empire , the kingdom.

So they were the ones choosing by the will of God , who is the next king , who is the next queen.

So that 's why they called to this system the power of the divine because it was God , the divine that brought this idea , brought this power to this people.

So this is why religion started to be like the way in which the king 's and queens were chosen and that 's why the structure was called the divine , hierarchy.

So what happened with the hierarchy that whatever is holy in heavens , you can not judge , you can not doubt about it is faith.

So it ensures the consequence of the system , the divinity allowed this to keep going. But what happened with education , education teach you about doubt , about question , the things so you can grow and understand the world.

So it 's complete opposite to a hierarchy.

So that 's why education was not the best system for those who were following the hierarchy. We used to say that hierarchy is a system that is a pyramidal system that is controlling us , but hierarchy is only related to a system that comes straight from the idea of the power of God. Yes , that is only the way in which we can call hierarchy. And that 's how education was not well seen in that period because education would be a menace to the system , to the civilization , to the structure.

So education is exactly the opposite to what a hierarchy is because a hierarchy considered in politics and religion comes from the power of the outside coming below.

So to us , from the sky to us on earth , from the outside to within. But the education itself is speaking about how our inner power can go out to the world.

So it 's exactly the opposite to what a hierarchy is. And this is why they saw education as a civilization. They got it. No , it was different.

The system was we have these questions and we need to see how you will solve it.

So this is why they start to find the options to problems.

So the education was to try to solve questions not to learn the answers.

So I would just explain something , parenthesis , I do n't know how to say English. I will always speak about the systems related to Greece and Rome and why is that because we are in a localized world and the cultures that make the globalization came from the Mediterranean sea. Egypt is real Syria , Lebanon , Turkey , Greece , Rome , Italy , France , Spain.

So those countries are the one that molded the whole philosophy of the world.

So that 's why we go straight to the Mediterranean sea. Of course there are many other ways like in China , like in Central America , there are many different ways. But here we 're speaking about the global idea of everything.

So that 's why I go always to the Mediterranean. Because of this we go again to Greece to the islands of Greece and what happened in Greece that in the same moment where all these politics were started to come in the islands and so on. The education started to be different because the priests and priestess started to question themselves what if the gods are not real? What if everything that we are believing in is just a perception?

What if it is different?

So they started to doubt and they started to think about different options.

So they started to love to question their reality and to look for wisdom. Love for wisdom in Greece is philosophy.

So philosophy means the lovers of wisdom. This philosophy is to open this space in public to talk about the wisdom to question the things. And they took benefit of it , they took benefit of the situation of the police. All the people were working all the day.

They were doing politics. What is politics for Greek people? For Greek people , politics was to do the normal works for everyday for the city.

Remember , city means police. The police is the name for city in Greek.

So the politics , the politicians , where the people that were working in the cities , the states of the city.

So they were working day and then they had this moment of diversion where they just relaxed and do whatever. And they just choose an open place to do that , to relax , to speak , to share , to love , this open garden.

So , laser laser , you say in English , the relaxation , the moment of relaxed after the politics. In Greek , you call school. School is the origin of the word school , but means to relax , laser , to have fun. That 's it.

And the place , the garden , where you are supposed to do this , it was the Allah , the classroom.

So , that they call alla.

So , all the people that wanted to share , to think , to talk about whatever , the philosophers would go there and ask them , why this guy is blue , and they would love and talk about and try to find some answers. To relax the mind. It 's really weird that when we realize that for the past , to get fun , was to go to open place to think and to imagine possible answers to the things. But the reason for this is because the environment was totally different from us.

Like for example , in that moment the work , the politics was all about strength. It was all about how we work with the body. And then it could relax. All they were trying to do was to think , to imagine , to share the De , that was the way in which they could relax.

But in our civilizations today , it 's all about thinking , all about the mind , all about what can you do with your mind.

So that 's why we 're working with the mind. The last thing we want to do is to think , which has to do physical things.

So let 's say opposite. Here comes this moment when the priest and priest , the priest , back with the idea of the divine , the sight and the purpose of the earth , of the civilizations.

So Rome and Greece fell into the power of the divine again. And that 's what made the free thinkers , the ones that were building the knowledge through the doubts. They were forbidden , because there would be against their own power.

So it would take many centuries until in the Renaissance , everyone starts to speak about education again. After many centuries , the concept of education will come back in the Renaissance.

So Renaissance is to go back to be born.

So it 's a researching of the culture.

So the Renaissance , in the 16th century , comes back as trying to put all the concepts of Greece again in Europe.

So they bring the doubt again as a way of learning.

So the current in France , it creates the scientific method about testing and experimenting. Then in the 17th century , the enlightened ones , the luminati , they tried to design a concept of education , which is like racism. And to make people free thinkers again. But all of that that they start to do from the 16th century and 17th century is related to a concept of schooling that was called college.

The college is something that in Greece was called for an obligated education of those who were chosen to do certain tasks.

So the college was mostly military and they were preparing people to do something through curriculum.

So the church took this concept of college and created the ecclesiastical college and the free thinkers took the idea of college and put inside of it education for the free thinkers. The illuminate , the illuminate , where the ones that were teaching the people without the light , that 's what they used to say.

So the people , the ignorant people , they needed the light.

So this light of the illuminate , where had to go into those without the light , which are the students , which is aluminum , aluminum.

So these people were the ones that we had that in that moment , they needed to put light on them.

So this concept was brought again , but no , not us , as education , but as a college.

So they had this curriculum to put the knowledge in the head of the people , to put the information inside the head of the people. What this enlightened or illuminated people did was to do exactly what was happening through many centuries.

So instead of doing a hierarchy , because it was holy from God , they took that and created a republic.

So through the republic they said , now we will have a free education which is obligatory and everyone that is ignorant must learn about everything that all the scientific scientists can learn.

So everyone has all the knowledge inside the head.

So that 's it.

So it was perfect at that moment this system , because what they were trying to , was to set ourselves away from the screen system , the dark times of the middle ages.

So in the religion , so they were trying to create something different , so it was really good.

So basically what what happened is that this all this line of system in which everyone in the population got to get the information that the scientists were understanding , but they did n't do it through education.

So they did it through teaching.

So teaching would be teaching would be to say what is the truth. This is the truth and I have to show you the truth that is teaching.

So in education it 's a circle of the opposite.

So just a few of them , the scientist and Elliot was able to study through education to make experiments to look for the truth. Those people , those people , where the ones learn and everything and then they put that in books that the rest of the population must learn because they were the ignorance.

So in the same way , the society would be the truth , but it would not be the truth. Their goal was to make all the population to learn by force , but nobody learns being pushed to it. Education comes from within , not from outside. What we really have today in education is not education.

It 's a system that was used in the high society , the elite in the 17th century that was adapted in the republics in the 18th and 19th century.

## Energy Work

So we are in the 21st century with the politics , a religion and an education that are based in the 16th century. And we have a society and we have an economy , a culture and a technology that are already in the 20th century. We should say that we have three systems from 500 years ago that are ruling three systems that are working today. And those three systems , education and the third chara , politics and the third eye and religion in the crown chara are the ones , the three systems that are related to the spiritual connection of our self.

How can we change education if education is the truth? The only way you can change education is when you know how to handle your own boat , how to move through the old and of yourself. And the way you can do it is if you have your north , if you know what is your north , which is brutality.

So until you do n't connect with your higher self with your inner self , you can not know where you go. You can not relate yourself to the power of yourself on earth. And until you do n't do it , you wo n't be able to take out your truth what you really are.

So it 's not this can start by the education , it 's can start by the change in education , this must start by a change in a connection that we have with our own self. And until we are not able to do that , we are going to have teachings.

Today our education is related to the system of the 17 and 18 century in the Pearl of the Revolution , where people started to be evaluated with numbers as a product from 1 to 10.

## Q&A

So this is why education is not about changing the ways , it 's not about changing the curriculum. It 's about to ask the right questions , it 's about to share ideas to be creative. That 's education. As a task for this , is just to try to learn something new every day.

Just as silly as possible , that 's not matter. But I 'm trying to do this every day , just to ask something and look it in the internet , ask someone , try to imagine the options and then look if they work or not. Just try to act the questions and try to look for answers within and the outside. And that will activate the education within.

But it 's not only about to think , to think in new things , it 's about to do new things. And I 'm saying also to question , what I am saying for example , what I am saying , you have to question everything , but no , I am not saying the question to question , no , you are saying it wrong. No , that 's not question something. To question something is to say , I do n't know if this is , I will look into it , I will look for it , I will learn something new.

We can not push the new kids to try to learn things in school. When most of the things that they are teaching in the school are just nonsense for the being. Everything that is being taught in schools is amazing , but only when the question comes.

Today schools are not educating today. This is a college that teach. And the only way in which we can heal education is by beginning to do ourselves , all the questions. And just something for the practice in the future.

The way in which we will start to heal education is not to teach better things to the kids for 25 years to see if then they can solve the problems of humanity. The education is about solving problems. The humans comes to this life to solve problems. Our brain is designed to solve problems.

So we really need problems to be solved. And if we put those real problems that we have in the school , we can help this new humanity to awaken their potential to find options.

Solutions. And not losing the time. The vibration for today is the , the state and the for today is I am the ex of the truth. The code for today is for phosphorus.

The carrier of light as it translates from Greek. He 's a tetrahedron that works as a base for all life. For being a mineral of great abundance and taken one and the second one in the living organisms. It 's absorbed by plants from the earth crust and transmitted this way to the animal king.

Both have it as the fundamental basis of NA and air in a. And this , this enlightened being is the key of our existence. Just makes me love is that. All these issues that we are speaking about.

I could never do it right in the school like my teachers would say like , what are you doing because I was never able to explore things. And now here I am talking about them in front of 4,000 people.

So it 's funny.

So I of course I am an example that you learn when you when you do the question because I learned all this. Way after I left school. I remember learning this in school. Let 's go to the alignment.

I started to massage from my feet to my head. Me in a wear of all my body and the ocean that inhabits in it. And I began to focus in my breathing. I was just going to do it.

## Guided Meditation

I was just going to do it. I was just going to do it. Besides breathe , I recognize that my soul had chosen my body to live with it. For it is the only way for them to experience and to learn about life.

My body is the best place for education. As I take a deep breath , I recognize that is the spirit willing to express through the body to life. Recognizing that this is the real process of education , the action of taking what is in the soul towards the outside. Within me , I can find all the answer.

## Q&A

The only way to let them out is to find the right questions. The question is the key that awakens the spirit. The answer that lives within me. By the law of polarity , of course , and effect , of vibration and correspondence , my questions are reflected.

The world of show me the reflections of the answer within.

So I pay attention to the environment. I can see the answers within. Take a deep breath and go within to look for the spirit inside this classroom that is your body. Picture your body as a big cloud.

Inside of it , you can see your classmates and your teachers. And you face of the people you know in your life. Realize who are those that accompany me with a question and who are those that accompany me towards dancers. I recognize that all the answers are within me.

And that these people around are those two kind of. I honor my master. I honor classmates. Desire seeing I unite all of them within me as the truth that awakens my essence.

I honor my master. I am the essence of truth. I am the essence of truth. I educate my spirit.

I am the answer. Take a deep breath and start to carry out your body stretching , bringing all this to every part of it. Income here and now , warning. You are ready for being there as always.
