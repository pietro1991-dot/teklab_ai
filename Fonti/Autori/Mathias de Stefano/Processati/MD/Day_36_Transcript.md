## Overview

Day 36 descends to the sacral chakra, the center of creation where we transform everything we've received into something new. This teaching introduces one of the most memorable metaphors of the Virgo month: **life is like making a salad**. Everyone brings you vegetables (energy), you wash them, cut them, mix them together, add your own ingredients (transformation), and serve the salad to everyone (giving back).

Matias discovered comments on his YouTube videos and spent two hours reading them all, expressing gratitude for the good vibes and support. He went to the pyramid, then to a field of mangos in the delta—grounding himself in nature while doing this intense mental work. The sacral work is about frustrations and achievements, two energies that live in the same creative center but produce vastly different results.

The revolutionary insight is this: **achievements and frustrations are not things from the past**. They are energies that exist RIGHT NOW in your body. The body doesn't have a concept of past and future—if you feel frustration or achievement, it's happening in the present moment. Both are constantly renewing or constantly rotting, depending on whether we're using them or holding them.

The salad metaphor expands beautifully: When people bring you tomatoes (love) and lettuce (weakness), you're meant to mix them together to create something new—tenderness, sweetness—and serve it back. But if you put the tomato in the fridge because it's so beautiful and you don't want to lose it, it rots. That rotten tomato is your frustration. It was love once, but you tried to preserve it instead of using it in the creative process.

Meanwhile, the salad you DID make—mixing what you had—becomes an achievement. It nourishes. People come back for more. The achievement keeps renewing because you completed the circuit. The frustration keeps festering because you interrupted it.

The task is brutally simple: Write down your achievements and your frustrations. Not to judge them, but to see what you've done with the vegetables you've been given. And for the rotten ones? Make compost. Use them to grow something new.

## Core Teaching

### Discovering the YouTube Comments

Matias shares something delightful: "I just wanted to thank you for all the comments, all the good vibes, everything that you are writing. What happened was I was searching for something on YouTube, and suddenly I saw one of my videos. I said, 'Oh my God, I'm in YouTube!' And I opened it to see how it sounded. Suddenly, I saw all the list of comments below. I said, like, 'Oh my God, what is this?' So anyway, really, I had no idea about the comments, and I was trying to read some of them. Really, I've been like two hours trying to read all the comments in every video."

After going to the pyramid, he went to a field of mangos in the delta. He wrote the blog post very late, after 11. This is why maybe you don't feel—he's been coughing much as he did, so the practice is working. He says, "I set it—for sure I will cough."

### The Sacral Chakra: Center of Creation

We find ourselves in the sacral chakra inside the week of the mind. To be honest, he doesn't remember exactly what he wrote today. He checks: "It is about the frustrations and achievements. Yeah, okay."

Let's try to understand what frustrations and achievements mean according to the sacral chakra. Remember, in order to understand the energy of the chakra we're working with, we always have to picture the idea of from where does it come, the energy.

If we are in the sacrum, we will have the relation with the plexus and, of course, the heart chakra. We understand the **center of creation is the sacrum**. We need to understand the relation it has with the plexus and the heart.

### Review: The Heart Circuit

Let's remember: The heart does to bring, to receive the energy, to give the energy. It goes through the heart. This is the circuit of energy—positive and negative, constantly. Remember, does the heart chakra receive and give energy? It doesn't matter from where. If you're right-handed or left-handed, it doesn't matter. The receiving hand is always the left one, the closer one to the heart.

Through the heart, through the heart, the energy is processed. It's absorbed by the body. It became like nutrients for the self, for the being, for the I Am.

We can say energetically, maybe the heart is like the esophagus that brings all the energetical food to the stomach.

### From Heart to Plexus to Sacrum

The energy that comes from the receiving in the left, the left hand, then goes to the heart. It goes to my plexus. The plexus is the source of energy of my own self. The energy goes from the heart to the plexus.

The plexus—what it does is to absorb it, to make that energy a part of myself. It is created as myself. When it is already created, it's strong. Now I am able to give it back again to the others.

How can we understand this circuit? **I receive energy. I channel from my heart to my plexus. I made the energy part of myself. I create the energy as part of my potential. From my potential, I take action. Through my action, I give back the energy to others.**

This is like a perfect circuit: I receive the energy, I made it mine, I activate my potential, and then by action, I give it back to others.

### The Sacral Transforms Energy Into Creation

What happens? In order to give back the energy, the thing we have to do is to recognize we need to create with the energy. We need to make a product of the energy. We could take action with will.

To understand better is: all the energy I received goes through my heart, activates the potential in myself in the plexus, then it goes to below. **It creates something—a product, something new. It transforms the energy I receive into something different, something transcendental, something new.** I could use it to give it for others as an action.

### Life is Like a Salad

We could work with many examples with this because life works like that. That's the basement of life. I will make an example that is very silly and easy.

We have to picture: with emotions, it works exactly the same. When we are talking about the system, even if we are speaking about the physical, the emotional, or the mental aspect, they work exactly the same.

To picture the example, it's like: **you have a dinner at your house. You organize a dinner at your house. You didn't have anything to make the food. You ask for your friends that are coming to bring the things to make the food.**

For example, you ask for one of them to give you the tomatoes. The other one, let's use the other one—mushrooms, for example. They bring you—each one of them brings you something different.

**When they bring it to you, you get all the things. Then you wash it, you cut it, you put it all together. You put oil, you put salt. You prepare the salad. Then they're all sitting at the table. You go with a salad with all the things you didn't have. They brought to you. You made the process, and you give it to others by action.**

Would be the example. It would work for everything—for mental, for emotional, anything. Just remember the salad.

There's a saying some people used to say: "Life is like a salad." It's like a mess, all mixed. Picture that life is really like a salad.

### The Salad Example: Receiving, Processing, Creating, Giving

Everyone have brought you something different. You you have all mixed. You don't know who brought you what. So that's kind of what life works.

To understand we are doing in the Virgo month, it's like we take our own salad. We are taking the tomato out, saying, "Who gave me this tomato?" The other one, you know, "Who gave me this carrot?"

This is kind of what we are doing. **Where is the salad being prepared? Specifically in the sacrum. At the sacrum is specifically the spot, the point, you prepare everything. You create everything. You put all the parts together to create something new.**

By creating something new, you are able to share it.

Having this image, we have to recognize this is the center of creation. This is the place I receive the energy. I recognize the potentials of the energy. I create something, and then I can deliver it.

### Consciousness: Recognizing Each Vegetable

Let's keep with the salad example to understand. First of all, we have to recognize that **if I am aware, if I am conscious, I will first recognize each vegetable I will receive from others. I will recognize that vegetable was given by whom, by who. I will recognize that person has an attachment or no attachment, has the same vibration or a resonance with with the vegetable.**

If he or she is giving the fruit to me, it's they resound with with the vegetable.

Imagine if you are conscious, you will recognize that person is giving me a tomato. It's a fruit. The tomato, it means like it has the shape of the heart. It has the color. So it's like that person is giving me a part of his love or hers or his love.

Imagine some of them is giving me lettuce. Lettuce, that means for example, it's something weak. The lettuce is like weak. That other person is giving me a part of its weakness.

I receive it. I know from where it comes. That's the resonance of that person. I received these two things—weakness and love.

### Creating Something New: Tenderness from Love and Weakness

Picture that those two vegetables are very fresh. They just gave it to me. When I receive these two, I will prepare a salad, mixing the tomato and the lettuce—the weakness and the love—putting both together. **I create tenderness—tender, to be tender, something soft.** I don't know the word. "Tender," it says. Okay.

I create weakness and love both together—lettuce and tomato, both together—tender. I give tenderness. It's—I'm becoming tender for those people, for both of them.

Basically, I am giving something I created, something. Being aware, being aware of what I created—something that was useful for both of them. I'm giving them that tender, sweetness. One of them were willing to receive love, and the other one was soft. He needed tenderness for to to feel better. The other one, love—it's mostly the same.

I was able to do this because **by being aware, by being conscious, I knew what the others needed. I create something new for myself to give to them in balance.**

### Unconsciousness: Hoarding the Tomato

See? Imagine the same situation. If you are unconscious, what you will do is: you receive the tomato from that person. Remember, the tomato is love. You remember you received the tomato from that person. You see this tomato is so beautiful. It's so perfect. You don't want to cut it. You would lose that beautiful love.

What do you do? You put it in the fridge. You say, "I will leave it for later. I would like, I would love to see that tomato once again. It's it's so beautiful."

I put it in the fridge. Imagine the other one gives me the lettuce. I don't like much the lettuce. I just cut the lettuce and say, "I will prepare it quickly so they eat it and they leave away."

What happened? That the one that brought me love in the tomato shape, the one that loved, brought me weakness in the lettuce shape. Myself, all of us, have eaten a salad made of only weakness—only weakness. In the meantime, **the tomato is dying in the fridge**.

### The Rotten Tomato: Frustration

What happens? I someday open the fridge. I will see that the tomato is already dead, rot, rotten—rot. I don't know. Okay. It's useless for anything. Just realized about that.

What we have—what we used to call **attachment is to put the love or the tomato in the fridge**. By trying to not lose it, it got rotten. It's useless.

This means when I am not using the energy, the energy gets stuck, attached to my body. In this process of creation, we can have two different things: If I recognize, if I recognize, by giving the tomato and the lettuce, the salad, putting them all together, recognizing about the good is to receive and to give without expecting anything, **that is what we call achievement—to use the energy now. I achieved something into the outside.**

In the other hand, I go open the fridge one week or one month later. I saw the tomato rotten. **That's what we call frustration.**

### Frustrations and Achievements Are Not in the Past

We usually think that achievements and frustrations are things I left in the past. They are things from the past. We have to realize that we usually believe that frustration and achievement are in the past. We used to believe that they stay in the past.

**There is no past for the body. If I feel frustration, if I feel achievement, it's not that the body thinks they were. If the body feels it, it's happening.** It's happening here and now.

Both of them are things that are constantly—they hadn't passed. They are here. Why? They are here. Why these two things are happening? Because what I did—my friends, they liked so much the salad I did, they came back once again the other week. They came back again.

The tomato, it's still in the fridge. The same tomato. **The achievement is something that because it was an achievement, it keeps staying. It's constantly renewal energy for me.** It's like my friends are coming back to my home. I made them a good meal.

The other thing—the tomato is still in the fridge.

### Using Rotten Energy as Compost

How do I do to make something that is rotten to be useful again? **The way in which I will use the rotten emotion is by using it as a compost.**

I take the tomato, and I put it on the ground. I create the compost with the tomato. The same seed of the tomato using the rotten part of it will create a plant. Not only I will receive a new tomato—I will have many of them. I have a plant.

**The way in which I can use the compost is best by just taking the frustration, the energy of frustration. I take it again. I recognize it. I look around me. I try to picture in what relationships I have as friends, whatever, I just try to picture what situations are similar to the things that happened to me.**

I, with that energy, **take action to try to nourish or stop what I did in the other time**. Like, for example, something I didn't say, something I didn't know how to handle, I tried to handle it differently. I use that energy as an awareness.

Also, I can write a letter to the people of what happened, write a message with the awareness of living away, letting it go. In this way, I'm beginning to understand to use the energy.

### The Body Doesn't Know—The Body Feels

The body doesn't know it's history. The body feels history. And so this is what we do. The kind of things is we can heal and work with our body in this moment. **Just remember, life is a salad. Don't leave the vegetables to get rotten. Those who got rotten, just made some compost.**

We can know—how can we create the compost? First, we have to acknowledge, to recognize which vegetables got rotten, which ones were able—you were able to give to your friends in the table.

I hope the example was useful for you. If you didn't get it, see the video again.

## Practice

### Preparation

As always, we begin by caressing the body, by massaging the body. Put yourself in a comfortable position. Stretch, yawn. Let the weight of your body fall down as you start to focus in your breathing. With imagination, bring to your breathing the oxygen through your nose to your lungs, heart, blood, organs, and muscles.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Sacral Chakra

1. **Feel the heat.** As you breathe, allow yourself to feel the heat within your body, how that heat goes through your skin, feeling filling up your magnetical field and your aura.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Imagine the light of the I Am over my head. With your imagination, feel that all the energy, the heat around me, starts to spin, going up, filling, filling up all that light of the I Am, making it brighter and brighter.

3. **Descend through all chakras.** Allow yourself to feel the I Am coming down through my body, going through my crown of beliefs, my qualities in the brain, my truth in the throat, my service in my heart, going down through the plexus to all my potentials.

4. **Light the sacral center.** Observe the light of the I Am irradiating in the second chakra, in the sacrum. Recognize in the sacrum the center of my creation, the place that everything I can do is generated.

5. **Acknowledge achievements and frustrations.** Recognize that in this center of creation, I have two energies: one of my achievements, the other one of my frustrations. Both energies are useful for myself to create. And I allow myself to irradiate the light of the I Am through all my achievements, through all my frustrations, recognizing that both of them are useful for my creativity.

6. **Activate both energies equally.** I activate these two energies as equal, in balance, through my vibration: **Ny... Ny... Ny...**

7. **Bring consciousness.** As you keep pronouncing the sound, recognize that the I Am is the one able to bring consciousness to my process of creation. I am the being that brings the message of balance and harmony and creation through consciousness.

8. **Embody the statement.** Take a deep breath: "I am the Emissary of Creation. I am the Emissary of Creation. I am the Emissary of Creation."

### Closing

Take your hands to my heart. Recognize that as my achievements, as my frustrations, both of them create the energy of who I am right now. Both of them are the energies I have right now to create. And and from the I Am, with my consciousness, I recognize I am able to use both of them in order to create new realities in harmony.

Take a deep breath: "I am the Emissary of Creation. I am the Emissary of Creation. I am the Emissary of Creation."

Take a deep breath. Start to stretch the body, bringing all the consciousness from the heart, caressing, massaging, stretching, thanking the body for being the anchor of the consciousness. And yawn. Come back and softly open your eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Write a list of your achievements and in another column, your frustrations.

**Achievements:** Things you completed, energies you used well, relationships where you created something new and shared it, moments where you transformed what you received into something that nourished others and yourself.

**Frustrations:** Things left incomplete, energies you tried to preserve and that rotted, relationships that stagnated, moments where you held onto something beautiful instead of using it in creation.

Remember, both are useful. Achievements show you what works—the circuit completed. Frustrations show you what got stuck—the compost waiting to be used.

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice when someone gives you energy (attention, love, an idea, help, criticism). Ask yourself:
- What "vegetable" is this?  
- What does it represent from them?
- What can I create with it?
- Am I going to use it in the salad, or put it in the fridge?

When you find yourself hoarding something—a compliment you're replaying in your mind, a grievance you're nursing, a memory you're clinging to—check: Is this tomato rotting in my fridge? What would happen if I used it now to create something new?

When you notice a frustration—something that didn't work out, something you failed at, something you lost—ask: Can I make compost from this? Can I use this rotten energy to nourish something new? What seed is hiding in this decay?

The body doesn't live in past or future. It lives in the felt sense of now. If you feel achievement, you're recreating it now. If you feel frustration, you're keeping it alive now. You have the power to choose which energies to renew and which to compost.

---

## Q&A

### Q: How can achievements from the past still be "happening now" if they happened years ago?

Because every time you feel the pride, satisfaction, or energy from that achievement, you're recreating it in your body in the present moment. The achievement isn't a fixed event in history—it's a renewable energy source. Like friends coming back to eat your salad again—the circuit continues as long as the energy keeps flowing. The moment you stop using the achievement (stop building on it, stop sharing it, stop letting it inform your current creations), it begins to rot like everything else.

### Q: If I have a frustration from childhood, how do I make compost from something that happened so long ago?

The frustration isn't "from childhood"—it's alive in your body right now. You're feeling it now. To make compost, you don't go back in time. You take the energy you're feeling in the present moment and use it to nourish something current. For example: "I felt rejected by my father. That energy is frustration in my fridge. How can I use this to recognize rejection in others and offer them the acceptance I needed? How can I use this to become more skillful at seeing and honoring my own needs?" The rotten tomato becomes the seed for a new plant.

### Q: What if I can't remember my achievements? I only seem to focus on frustrations.

That's a common pattern—frustrations are "louder" because they're demanding to be processed. But achievements are there too, often taken for granted. Ask yourself: What relationships am I still in that nourish me? (You created those.) What skills do I use daily without thinking? (You achieved those.) What simple joys do I experience regularly? (You built the capacity for those.) Start small. The achievement doesn't have to be grand. Did you make someone smile today? That's a salad you served. Did it feel good? That's renewable energy.

### Q: The teaching says don't leave vegetables to rot, but also says use rotten vegetables as compost. Which is it?

Both. Ideally, use everything fresh—complete the circuit, create with what you receive, give it back. Don't hoard out of fear. But realistically, we all have rotten vegetables in the fridge—things we held onto that went bad. For those, don't waste them further by throwing them away in shame or regret. Make compost. Use the decay to grow something new. Prevention (using things fresh) is ideal. Remediation (composting what rotted) is the backup plan.

### Q: How do I know what to create with what I receive?

If you're conscious, you recognize what each person is giving you and what they need. You see the tomato (love) and lettuce (weakness) and realize "Oh, tenderness is what's needed here—something that honors both." If you're unconscious, you won't know. You'll just react, hoard, or waste. The key is the awareness piece: What is this really? Where did it come from? What does it want to become? Trust that if you ask these questions, the answer arises. The sacral is a creative intelligence, not just a mechanical process.

### Q: Can I have too many achievements? Can I be "addicted" to achieving?

Absolutely. If you're addicted to the feeling of achievement, you might create compulsively, always needing the hit of accomplishment. That's the circuit running too fast, burning you out. Or you might hoard past achievements, living on your reputation, not creating anything new. Both are imbalances. The healthy pattern is: receive, create, give, receive again. If you're constantly creating without ever receiving fully, or constantly achieving without ever resting, you'll deplete. Balance requires both action and receptivity.

### Q: What's the difference between making compost from frustration and just ruminating on failure?

Rumination is keeping the tomato in the fridge and obsessively checking it, smelling it, mourning its decay, but never using it. Making compost is taking the rotten tomato, acknowledging "Yes, this decayed," and deliberately putting it into soil to grow something new. The difference is action and direction. Rumination circles. Composting transforms. Ask yourself: Am I thinking about this frustration to punish myself, or to learn something I can apply now?

### Q: The salad metaphor makes it sound like other people are responsible for giving me what I need. What if they don't?

Then you work with what you have. Maybe you only got lettuce and no tomato. You make a lettuce salad. Maybe someone brought you something bitter or hard to work with. You still have to create with it or consciously choose not to use it (and accept the consequences). The metaphor isn't about passively waiting for others to provide everything. It's about recognizing that we exist in interdependence, that we receive from the world (through people, nature, experiences), and our job is to transform what comes and give something back. If your environment is scarce, your creations will reflect that, but you're still creating.
