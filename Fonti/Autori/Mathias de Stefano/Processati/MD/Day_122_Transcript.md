## Overview

Today we explore the true meaning of "dimension" - not as separate realms or levels of spiritual hierarchy, but as different measurements and perspectives of one unified reality. We trace how humanity's social structures throughout history shaped our understanding of the universe, and how we must evolve from hierarchical thinking to network consciousness.

## The True Meaning of Dimension

Dimension fundamentally means **to evaluate measurements** of things we contemplate and see. It is about measuring size, depth, width, and extent. We have two concepts of dimension today:

1. **Physical dimension**: Measuring how things are in size (big, small, deep, wide)
2. **Spiritual/cosmic dimension**: The mistaken idea of different levels through which you can move in the universe

**The spiritual concept of dimensions as separate levels does not actually exist.** The only true concept of dimension is knowing how things are in size and manner. What we call "moving through dimensions" is actually changing our perception and perspective of one unified reality.

## How We Created the Hierarchy of Dimensions

Our current understanding of dimensions comes from thousands of years of human projection onto the universe. To understand this, we must trace how humanity organized itself socially and then projected that organization onto the cosmos.

### Animistic and Totemic Origins

In the beginning, humans saw **nature as the way of life**. We interpreted divinity through:
- Animals we ate and observed
- Plants that flowered and fed us
- Seasons and water cycles
- All aspects of nature as divine

This created **animistic religions** - the belief that divine potentialities live in the spirits of plants and animals. We called these symbols **totems**. The universe was created by animal spirits:
- Earth as the Great Tortoise
- Sea as the Holy Whale
- Sky made by the Eagle with two eyes (sun and moon)
- Tree of Life connecting all realms

### The Rise of Hierarchy

As tribes united to create societies, organization became necessary. The **king** emerged to rule and control. Different shamans and organizations created **hierarchy** - a structure of society needing more control.

We then projected this hierarchy onto the universe:
- **One God** at the top (like the king)
- **Pantheon of lesser gods** (like nobles)
- **Angels and guardians** (like priests and clergy)
- **Common people** at the bottom

### The Pyramidal Structure

For 10,000-12,000 years, we have lived in pyramidal social systems:
- **King/Emperor** on top
- **Feudal lords** (princes and nobles)
- **Priests and clergy**
- **Army**
- **Working population** at the bottom

This social structure shaped our entire vision of the universe. We organized cosmic reality exactly as our kingdoms:
- **God** at the top (like the king in his castle)
- **Seraphim and Cherubim** (like high nobility)
- **Archangels** (like high priests)
- **Angels** (like the army)
- **Humans** (common people)

In this system, **you cannot change your level** - just as in feudal society:
- God remains God (king remains king)
- Archangels remain archangels (priests remain priests)
- The only mobility is between angel and human (army and common people)

This created the idea of **fixed dimensional levels** where beings are trapped in their positions.

### The Spatial Hierarchy

We also organized the universe spatially:
- **Heaven** = up (where the king lives in the castle on the hill)
- **Earth** = down (where common people live)
- **Hierarchy of clouds** = different levels between heaven and earth

This is why medieval art (like Michelangelo's work) shows God in heaven above clouds, with different levels of beings arranged vertically.

## The Scientific Revolution and Dimensional Shift

In the 15th-16th centuries, the **Renaissance** brought rebirth of science and astronomy. We discovered:
- **Earth is not "down" and heaven is not "up"**
- **Earth is a sphere floating around the sun**
- There is no fixed "heaven" where God sits

This created a crisis: **Where is God if there's no heaven above?**

### From Strata to Dimensions

We began measuring **distances between celestial objects** - between sun, moon, and planets. Suddenly, there were no more hierarchical levels, only **distances to measure**.

This is when we shifted from **social strata** to the concept of **dimensions**:
- No more up and down
- Only **measurements of differences** between things in the universe

We started dividing dimensions as measurements:
- **First dimension**: A spot, a point (just one position)
- **Second dimension**: A line (projection showing distance you can measure)
- **Third dimension**: Depth (a third perspective, creating volume)
- **Fourth dimension**: Time (the movement of the object, making things change)
- **Fifth, sixth dimensions and beyond**: More aspects we cannot directly perceive

### The Modern Misconception

In just the last 100 years, we've changed from 10,000 years of hierarchical thinking to dimensional thinking. But we still carry the old paradigm.

**The problem**: People from the spiritual world brought the ideas of social/religious hierarchical organization into the concept of interdimensional realities.

This is normal - we had one vision for 10,000 years and changed it in only 100 years. In the last 30 years (just one generation), we've experienced working in **networks** instead of hierarchies through the internet and global connection.

We've only had 30 years of experiencing **connection and interdimensional network consciousness** compared to 12,000 years of hierarchical thinking. This is why it's natural that we still think dimensions are hierarchical structures.

## What Dimensions Really Are

**Dimension is only the different points of view, visions, perceptions, and measurements from one single thing, being, or object.**

The universe is **ONE** - we are all part of it. Dimensions are just different perspectives of observing this one reality. Everything is one being observed from different points of view.

### The Hand Analogy

Consider your hand - it is one hand, but it has:
- Palm side and back side
- Five fingers
- Nails, joints, knuckles
- Skin, bones, tendons

We call all of this "hand" - one thing with many dimensions (different aspects). The fingers can represent different "beings" (Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangel, Angel, Human):

- **From one perspective**: You see only one finger (appears to be alone)
- **The other fingers still exist** - they are behind the first one
- **All are part of the same hand** - all connected

When I position my hand to see only one finger, that's just **my perspective of reality** - the other fingers haven't disappeared. When I open my hand fully, I recognize **they are not different levels** - they are the same, just shifted in position.

### We Are All the Same Hand

When we talk about "different beings in different dimensions," they are just **different fingers of the same hand** - different parts in the same body, expressed from the same reality in different directions.

**We all have different paths to get to "I Am," but we all ARE "I Am."**

## Becoming Multidimensional

Nobody goes from one dimension to another. **We all live in all dimensions at the same time** - we ARE all dimensions. The only thing we do is **change our perception** to see different dimensions.

When people say "going into another dimension," it's like saying "going into another social class" - it's old hierarchical thinking.

**Our goal is not to go to another dimension.** Our goal is to **realize we are multidimensional** - we just need to remember and perceive that.

### How to Become Multidimensional

To open your perception and become aware of your multidimensional nature:

1. **Don't stay in the same point of view** - change your position
2. **Don't think the same things all the time** - expand your thinking
3. **Open your horizons** - be willing to learn something new
4. **Change your opinion** - allow different perspectives
5. **Dream** - explore imagination
6. **Travel** - experience different places (physically or through media)
7. **Talk with different people** - exchange perspectives
8. **Read books, watch movies** - journey through stories

You don't need to know how to channel or listen to other dimensions to become multidimensional. **All you need is to be open with your mind and willing to learn different things.**

The month of Sagittarius is about:
- Moving forward
- Changing your point of view
- Being willing to learn something different and new
- Widening your vision

## The Cube Geometry

The **cube (hexahedron)** creates the dimensions of the universe:
- **12 edges** = the 12 paths
- **8 vertices** = the 8 temporal and spatial dimensions (north, south, east, west, spring, summer, autumn, winter)
- **6 faces** = the 6 petals of the flower of life, attributes of the being

The cube contemplates the geometry that sustains realities, representing **air** and the **four pillars** that hold existence.

## Guided Meditation: Seeing All Dimensions

The meditation journey takes us through expanding perspectives:

1. Start as a seed under the mud, absorbing nutrients
2. Grow as a plant through the Tree of Life
3. Rise above the forest, seeing all trees and savanna
4. Ascend to the clouds, seeing oceans and continents
5. Move into space, watching Earth from above
6. Circle the planet, seeing all lands and waters
7. Recognize Earth as one being with infinite dimensional perspectives
8. Understand all dimensions live within you as one

**Key realization**: The dimensions of space, light and shadows, divine and eternal - all live in me. All of them are one. Through sound and vibration, we perceive these dimensions.

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Ma

**Statement:** I am the dimension of contemplation

**Code:** The Cube - precisely the geometry that creates the dimensions of the universe

**Meditation Focus:**
- Contemplate how dimensions are perspectives, not levels
- Recognize yourself as multidimensional by nature
- Practice changing your point of view daily
- See the 360-degree eternal horizon of contemplation
- Bring Earth's sphere to your third eye
- Allow three hundred sixty degrees of vision

**Integration:**
Rest and speak with the "other dimensions" (other perspectives). Practice seeing from different viewpoints. Maybe one day, you will be able to see all dimensions simultaneously - to truly contemplate the wholeness of reality.

**Reflection:** Dimensions are not places to go or levels to climb. They are measurements and perspectives of one unified reality. We are not trying to ascend to higher dimensions - we are awakening to the truth that we already exist in all dimensions simultaneously. The journey is not vertical but expansive - opening our perception to see what has always been present. By releasing hierarchical thinking and embracing network consciousness, we recognize ourselves as multidimensional beings contemplating infinite aspects of the One.
