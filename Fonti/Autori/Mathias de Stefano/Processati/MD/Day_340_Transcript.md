## Introduction

I have everyone been morning , good afternoon , good evening. I do n't have many words. I 'll take you to a little bit of the encommodays.

Today I went to the pyramid and when I went out , I almost faint again.

So I spend the whole day in bed again. And in 10 days to finish the wake-up stuff conscience.

Today I just wanted to talk about this image that I have here , regarding something that I wrote in the post , which is , I think , better written. And that is regarding the subconscious. Subconscious is our topic today.

So the image that we have here explains our topic.

So we can take that this shape here , which is the being , is like an iceberg in the middle of the sea notion.

So the part above the line is the conscious. The part below under the water is the unconscious. And then all the things that are like the air around the upper part in the conscience is what we call superconscious. And the part below surrounding with water , the unconscious is what we call the subconscious.

The division is because of this line here of the water. That means super means above and super means below and letting.

Remember that conscious comes from the word con which is together. Shea that means to divide to discern things and ends that means the being.

So is a being that can understand the separation or the different parts of something altogether. That 's a conscious being.

So a conscious being is the one that knows how to discern and basically not all of us , all the beings in the planet , all the humans are just aware of a tiny thing. Of a tiny part of themselves. Can realize about just tiny little parts. Can discern about a little bit of what reality is what oneself it is.

And the rest of it , like the 80 % of ourselves is unaware.

So it 's unconscious. The word un means no.

So a lack of.

So it means that we have no clue no idea of how to discern how to understand the different parts that are within us inside of us.

So that 's why the unconscious. This line here is the one that we would call the conscience , which is the division that we are aware. That we know things and we do n't know things.

So we are aware of.

So since the 20th century psychology has divided this interpretation of the being in between the conscious and the unconscious. Because basically is how we understand people like we are aware of our lives , we are aware of things from current. Common lives and the decisions that we take , but there are many other things that are unaware. Like emotions , trauma , feelings , attitudes , many things that we have within ourselves that we have in our own clue.

## Q&A

So that 's why in. That 's why in the unconscious , we have some much information from our own life from our. Experiences that we do n't record that we do n't know and in therapy usually we ask questions to the conscience.

So it can help discern what is inside the unconscious.

So we can understand that we can understand. What is shaping where we are now. The whole. Since then 1819 century people in psychology used to speak also about the super conscience and the subconscious.

To topics would describe much more much more of of what the being is , but. Usually in the 20th century the searches started to unify the subconscious with the unconscious quite a lot of people. Mistake both of them and have no clue how to divide or how to understand the difference between this two because usually in psychology. We used to call both like if it is the same like so both cons were coded in the unconscious and we say that all this here is unconscious.

So in the other hand we have the super conscience the super conscience is. Is beyond the conscience because it 's something that we do n't have any control of. There are things that just happen that we can not control them , but even though they bring us. And so the super conscience is not hiding anything.

It 's using everything to help the conscience.

So for example. The nerve system in the. The path to the. And the sympathetic system in mythology.

Is something that that helps the conscience in order to. Recognize the environment so it 's something that you can control and also all the previous classes. In order to get an idea the connections of that that you have in your brain before you can take an action. All those things.

And so we ca n't really remember our life. But we can control them is what we call the super conscience.

So you can have it the physical way with the nervous system. You can have it in the emotional level and also the mental level or they 're putting their ideas. And also the higher self. Is inside the super conscience is is a part of it.

Is it not that the higher self is a part or. Or it is the super conscience.

Okay. Much more about a part of it. In in the spiritual part of the super conscience.

So you can say that the super conscience is the one that helps us to bring order. To that helps us to be clear to bring light into the all the concepts.

So.

So all the super conscience is working for the conscience to be.

Okay. And in the other hand , we have the subconscious which is like the chaos which is. All in that we hide and we have not control not understanding of anything and it 's in the darkness. In the shades.

So the super conscience is the plane where. Our higher self. Connects. Our guides angels.

Masters. All this beings from other dimensions they can move with us through the super conscience. And it is like the air that is surrounding the tip of the iceberg.

So in the other side of the subconscious.

So all the chaos of. All our fears our trauma but also all the memories of past lives. Of other realities. Memories.

From all the history that are not ours. From this life that are from the entire reality.

So the subconscious is not something of my own. It 's not I share with many. The same way as the sub the super conscience because we can find other iceberg in the ocean.

So it 's the environment that holds all that. This is why when we try to remember past lives and other realities. That information can be mixed with information of others. In the same way as.

The super conscience when we receive messages from. The higher levels. The higher levels of realities. It one of us will receive it and receive it from and there 's different point of view.

So I think that now you can understand what is the subconscious. And. As you see. Is the chaos.

This is why the subconscious can bring us so to the depth. And bring so much chaos because. Is. There is.

Mark. In the past we used to. This. Proves.

Test that word. And one hand we had this test of walking through the desert. Crossing the desert. Without water anything.

Not knowing. About anything about where to go. Only knew that had to cross it. And it could take long time.

And. And during that time we would face this subconscious. And the other. And there was another test that was being in silent.

It came where close. Spot where is all dark. And you also had no clue about the time. Went to come out.

And you could start to get crazy.

So basically. The goal of this to test was to break the conscious. And the ego. The one the controls.

And start to break the unconscious. With all the emotions. And the suffering. And after that.

You start to get crazy. Delusion. And. You lose it.

So. The test by doing this is was. If you are able. To.

All it. If you are able to manage the subconscious. Where all the mess is there all information. All the.

Delusion. And if you do so. If you manage to control all that thing.

So you become a genius. Because you have no limit. You can do anything. It 's very.

Powerful to. To be able to connect. To connect with. The subconscious.

Because basically the subconscious is like the ocean that holds. All the iceberg. Is. Huge.

It has a lot of power.

So when you. And dive into. When you dive into the ocean. And to the subconscious.

You start to. Manage. But. And if you ca n't do it.

You get crazy. Of course that there are many. Many ways. In which you can.

Connect. With the subconscious. You can. Go through insomnia.

## Guided Meditation

Not sleeping. You can. Do some meditation. Use some sacred plans.

Drugs. There are many different ways for each person. To. To reach the subconscious.

## Q&A

But I would advise to everybody to have a purpose. A question. In order to do that. Because you need to have.

A goal. A north. Like. A compass.

To follow. Otherwise. It 's. It 's not good.

It could be. But.

So to to the consciousness. The main clue is to lose the ego. To lose. The control.

This is why when try. Get into this subconscious. You need to expand yourself. You 're yourself.

And. That 's why. It 's in. It 's in.

It 's in. You need to go through that. And through that laziness. Madness.

You can start to see everything. Like how everything 's connected. And not. Linear.

And from subconscious. One can be. Much more aware of all the memories that connect. Throughout the functions.

So in order to be connected with the subconscious , this needed for us to be a little bit crazy.

## Daily Practice Elements

So when people used to say to me that I am crazy and what I do is madness or whatever , my only answer would be , yes , eat. Otherwise , I would n't be able to do what I do. Delivery for today. This statement for today is , I am the infinite dreamer.
