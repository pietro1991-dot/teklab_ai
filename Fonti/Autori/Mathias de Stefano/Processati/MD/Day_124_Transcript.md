## Introduction

Hi everyone , good evening. Language is served , makes me mad. The final thing of this translating thing is that whatever I do every day , even if I am not doing anything , I translate everything I had constantly. I 'm getting used to to live like that.

Maybe in 2002 , in 2002 , I would be able to work as a translator , doing it bad , but I would be able to do it. I 'm so sorry for those who ca n't stand that I translate myself every sentence , but sorry , this is the faster and all the way. And also , I have to thank to all the people that I know they speak other languages , and even if your main language is not , it 's not Spanish , neither English , you are doing the effort , so I understand everything , so thank you.

So let 's begin with the topic for today , which is related to the heart , and that would be a bunch.

So first of all , to understand that we call this bunch , any English , bunch does n't have a specific origin known at least , but it 's related with the pressure , the push of something.

Something that is put in pressure and pushing ahead , okay.

So we usually call that a bunch , and it 's related with the heart , because it 's something that you feel when you are being pushed ahead , and you feel this feeling that , oh , this is something that I have to do , now I get it , now I know what I have to do. This feeling makes your heart beat so fast that it 's like the heartbeat , the one that pushes you and it 's related to the bunch , bunch is pushing forward , so it 's like your heart pushing you forward , something like that. The concept of bunch is related with something that is moving us ahead. Important thing to understand is the difference between a bunch and intuition , because a bunch is something that pushed me to move , to go forward , to take action into something.

## Guided Meditation

And intuition is related to the idea of seeing something , previsualized something before it happens.

So it 's more about perceive what could happen than to take action on that.

So this is why we will relate much more the intuition with the head , with the thinking , and the bunch , with the heart , with the emotional.

So the main difference is that there is some people that are more intuitive than maybe can say , I can see what it 's going to happen. I ca n't pervisualize to perceive what is coming ahead. That 's intuition. And in the other hand , the bunch would be more from the heart , because it 's much more about feeling what you are going to do , what you have to do.

So the heart can only feel it 's like blind , can not see what is going to happen. It 's only feeling.

So the reason why I put the bunch in the mind and not in the soul is because it 's more related to the clarification of your development than only about feelings.

So this topic takes us to this economy which is mind and emotion which is brain and heart.

So we in this spiritual world we used to say , I have to follow my heart , not be so logical , do n't allow the mind to control your heart. But also even if spiritual people say , I have to follow my heart , we usually say we know we have to learn how to control our emotions.

So what 's the truth? What should we follow? That 's why we 're talking about bunch.

So first of all let 's try to understand how this works in our matter.

So our brain is the conjunction of neurons which is cells , neurons are cells. And this cells share information through a process that we call synapses. Synapses is this process of sending electrical pulses from one cell to another. And that creates information.

So the brain is a whole network of neurons sending pulses , electrical pulses , sharing information from one cell to another. And they receive that information from the pulses of the neuron system which is connected to the spine and from there to every nerve in the body.

So every nerve by pulses receive this data and the brain with the neurons , the codified this data.

So the brain is like a machine that decades an organized information.

So it 's like a machine that it 's predicting constantly the information. It works with prediction. And what this means that the brain is a storage information like in boxes relating to all the colors or one color. Everything that has this color goes in this folder.

Everything that has this shape goes in this folder.

So it organized like in a library from eight to seat the whole information.

Okay , so whenever you look for some specific information from some data you find a concept. What the brain does is to look for that concept in each one of the books from eight to seat and take all what you can find and put it all together so you can have an idea.

So the brain is the machine of prediction and why because when you throw a concept your brain for sure will take all information from that concept just in case is related with what you are trying to talk about.

So if I say for example red. Maybe your brain will say apple , terminus , blood , hard and they put all that together.

So suddenly you have different concepts , no related to each one to each other. No idea , but the brain says I am predicting that maybe your topic will be related with this issues.

So this is why it 's a prediction machine. The brain way does is to use intuition as a way to predict things.

So intuition , remember it means to stare at something very focused.

So intuition means to stare.

So this means that when you look deeply into something like the color red your brain is now able to find all the predictable information regarding to red.

So that 's why you can have the intuition of something that is going to happen because your brain is trying to bring all that information.

Now we leave the nervous system of the brain and we go to the circulatory system of the heart.

So first of all we have to understand that the heart , the heartbeat is not because the heart is moving is because of the pressure of the blood.

So depending on the pressure on the blood puts on the heart the heart will be faster or slower.

So this blood pressure will go through the body by these tubes that we call veins and artery. And this movement of the blood will be faster if they open and smaller if they close.

So it 's about the contraction or the expansion of the veins and the arteries that the blood pressure goes through and it moves faster or slower.

The reason why this happens this this veins and arteries expand or contract is because of the adrenaline , which is the adrenaline. That is producing these contractions in the in the in the vein system. And this adrenaline is produced in the adrenaline glands this adrenaline glands adrenal glands that are over the kidneys.

So the reason why this adrenaline activates the blood pressure around the body is because when something is happening around that I have no much time to react.

So the brain captures this information from the senses and informs the the adrenaline glands that we need a lot of blood pressure to prepare the muscles , the organs , the bones , the brain to be really active in order to prepare for a fast action that I can that I can not mediate. That that I have to act very fast.

So that 's that 's why the adrenaline starts to push the the blood towards everyone of the organs and muscles.

So so everyone has the pressure to work and to act with. Well , faster. And this is why the heart starts to beat faster.

So this feeling of the blood pressure moving around and how the heart beats faster can be either because you are about to have an accident and you.

So you 're not going to feel that and so your body is trying to prepare for whatever is going to happen and also it could happen. When you are in love. Which an accident and feeling in love for the body is most the same because it means that you have no idea why it 's going to happen. You have no idea what.

How to react to that situation.

So that 's why the the body things okay I have to put blood all over the body because I have no idea what is going to happen. Just in case the body must be prepared okay. Basically this is why when we fell in love. We feel this heartbeat.

It 's not because love is because the every of the glands things that maybe we are going to die.

So it 's kind of like the body is saying oh my god it 's possible that I can die. I do n't know what what to do.

So this takes all the romantic stuff to love and to the heart. But anyway it 's kind of. Love it works.

So what do we feel in that moment? What we feel is that we have no limits that we are capable of anything. We can do whatever.

So this feeling of adrenaline this feeling of. I can do whatever is the body the circulatory system same to me. Hey do whatever because I am ready for everything.

So do n't worry this will be okay it does n't happen it does n't matter what happens. The solution will be perfect because I am working for the whole body to be notified about all this.

So it 's all perfect and good. And this is when we understand the difference between brain and heart.

So the brain says in the brain size the brain says okay I 've seen this. Where I 've seen this before so I start to look for information. I 've seen it here there there there there there there. Oh oh okay now I get it now I know what is this about.

So be careful because I 've seen this before. And then we have in the other hand the heart that the circulatory system says okay I see the situation. I have no idea what it is but I am getting ready I 'm getting ready let 's go it does n't matter if it 's good or bad. I do n't care let 's go.

That 's the difference I guess now you see what.

So this is why when when the people is positive and they say it does n't matter what happened you have to move forward you have to evolve everything is going to be good. Usually is the people that says you have to live through the heart. The heart is the only way.

So the people from the mind is the one that says be careful because it 's all good with going ahead but you have to check every step you give you have to take. You have to know that maybe you can fall down so you have to be patient. And also you 're going there maybe it 's going to rain do you have an umbrella. That 's the mind people.

So this is how the mind people is the one that says be careful when you run under the rain because maybe a lightning can fall on you. I 've seen that happening. And also maybe you can get a cold.

So be careful it happens to me before okay.

So just pay attention and it 's okay all the feelings but take it. Breath. Think twice the rush. Control your emotions.

That 's a great difference.

## Q&A

Now the question would be which one is the best one which one should I follow? I should follow none of them. I have to use them as tools but not to follow them because if I follow the mind , the brain , it will try to control the emotions of my heart. And if I follow the heart , it will just kill myself because there 's no thinking.

It goes like a bull. Anyway.

So what I have to do is to find the balance of the tools. They are tools. This is why we can understand now the bunch. A bunch is this movement , this pulse from the heart that tells me I have to move forward.

I have to do something. I have to take action in this. Even if I have no idea if it 's good or bad result what it 's going to happen , but I have to do it somehow within me something is saying I have to do it. My heart is saying I have to do it.

The thing is that we have to picture like if the bunch of the heart is like a car. And in the mind I have the intuition. And the intuition is the driver of the car.

So I have to use intuition to guide me in my bunch. Because the driver by itself without the car can the ride faster to anywhere. It will take a long time to reach a place. But I car by itself.

It 's an accident for sure.

Okay.

So I have to use the intuition of my mind on the bunch of my heart.

So I can find balance between both of them.

So to understand in the universe how intuition works. Intuition is like a tuning fork.

Okay? You picture a tuning fork?

So you have a tuning fork. And then you heat one of them. And by resonance it starts to violate the other exactly the same. Imitating by intuition the same frequency.

So that would be.

So that 's intuition. It 's like one neuron another neuron connected.

So what a bunch is. A bunch is the energy that hits the tuning fork.

Okay?

So it 's the heat of the tuning fork. Is the energy , the positive energy that moves this vibration in order to create situations to move forward. There is no vibration and resonance of intuition without the heat of the energy that makes it violate.

So they both need each other. And this is why in order to develop my intuition , I need to follow my punches.

## Daily Practice Elements

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is ye. The statement for today is I am the dimension of the soul. The code for today is the Icosahedron.

According to Atlantembition this geometrical figure represents Pierre for its vertices in high. Like the peaks of the mountain towards the atmosphere towards the pure air and the wind. It is made of 20 faces 30 edges and 12 vertices. It sides contemplate the negative and positive aspects of the dimensions and main charts.

## Energy Work

Being the 30 edges , the path from the same dimension travel by the spirit , the soul and the body. 10 , 10 , 10. Open the portals 12 of a sphere.

So let 's go to the alignment. It 's funny I was thinking that I was finding that at the end of this alignment next year you always say , I love you from my pancreas and I fall in love with you from my adrenal. My kidneys are in love with you.

So funny way to see it. We begin to relax the body to see it comfortable. And we remember as we relax that we come from being below the mud and the earth become becoming seeds in between the roots of the tree of life. Take a deep breath , absorbing all the nutrients of this mud within the seed that I am.

And from there I begin to extend my roots to the depth of the earth. And towards both I extend my first leaves , listening to the animals in the forest. And begin to grow fast , aside the tree of life , reaching the branches and leaves. With my hands I accompany the shape of this flower that is willing to open , reaching the sun above the other trees.

I start to see all the trees from above , the birds and the savanna with all the animals. I did higher and higher , meaning poles by my inner self to flower. Much more open , watching the light around me. I cycle up , I begin to feel and to see the whole rainforest , the forest , the savanna and the coast with the ocean and the horizon.

I can see everything , reaching the skies with the eagle. And I feel surrounded by the light of the sun , the white color of the clouds and the light blue of the sky. I can see the whole sky and the ocean. I start to go out to the space and now I can see the light shining on the earth.

And in the horizon I can contemplate Africa. I can see Europe , Middle East , Asia , as I move around the planet. I can watch , I can see the Americas , the Pacific Ocean , Oceania and Antarctica. All the earth is shown in front of me , light it with clarity.

And I recognize that my heart beats in resonance with a heart of earth. And from the pulse that takes me to leave , I sing. I can see the sky and the sky. I can see the sky and the sky.

I recognize and set the intention to follow my punches with a guide of my intuition. For I am the dimension of the soul , I am the dimension of the soul. And with my hands I take the sphere of earth and light it and I bring it to my heart. Feeling the light , everything from my heart to every direction.

So I can say , I see , I see , I see , I see with clarity each pulse of my life. I see that with my heartbeat I create the path in front of me. I see that with my heart to every direction. I see that with my heart to every direction.

I take this consciousness all around my body , my creation , stretching until I come back here and now opening my eyes. I see that with my heart to every direction. Thank you for being there for sharing every day and as always see you tomorrow at the same time. Bye.
