## Overview

Today we explore the concept of "hunch" and how it differs from intuition. We examine the eternal debate between following the mind (brain) versus following the heart, discovering that neither should lead - both are tools to be used in balance. We learn how the brain predicts through intuition while the heart propels through feeling.

## What is a Hunch?

In English, **"hunch"** doesn't have a specific known origin, but it relates to **pressure** and the **push of something**. Something that is put under pressure and pushing ahead.

A hunch is related to the **heart** because it's something you feel when you're being pushed ahead. You feel this feeling of "Oh, this is something I have to do! Now I get it, now I know what I have to do!"

This feeling makes your **heart beat so fast** that it's like the heartbeat itself is the one pushing you. The hunch is pushing forward - your heart pushing you forward toward action.

## Hunch vs. Intuition

### Hunch: From the Heart

**Hunch** is something that **pushes me to move**, to go forward, to **take action** on something. It's about **feeling** what you're going to do, what you have to do.

The heart can **only feel** - it's like being blind. It cannot see what's going to happen. It only feels. This is why hunch relates to the **heart**, to the **emotional**.

### Intuition: From the Mind

**Intuition** relates to **seeing something**, to **pre-visualizing** something before it happens. It's more about **perceiving what could happen** than taking action on it.

Intuition is more related to the **head**, to **thinking**. Some people are more intuitive - they can say "I can see what's going to happen, I can pre-visualize, I can perceive what is coming ahead."

### Why Hunch is in Mind Week

Even though hunch is from the heart, we place it in the **Mind Week** (not Soul Week) because it's more related to the **clarification of your development** than only about feelings. It's about the conscious choice to act, not just emotional reaction.

## The Brain: The Prediction Machine

### How the Brain Works

Our brain is a conjunction of **neurons** (cells) that share information through **synapses** - the process of sending electrical pulses from one cell to another. This creates information flow.

The brain is a **whole network of neurons** sending pulses, sharing information through:
- The neuron system
- Connected to the spine
- Through every nerve in the body

Every nerve receives data through pulses, and the brain with its neurons **decodes and organizes** this information.

**The brain is like a machine that decodes and organizes information** - it works with **prediction**.

### The Brain's Organization System

The brain is a **storage system** - like information organized in boxes:
- Everything with this color goes in this folder
- Everything with this shape goes in another folder
- Like a library organized from A to Z

Whenever you look for specific information or a concept, the brain:
1. Looks for that concept in each folder from A to Z
2. Takes all related information it can find
3. Puts it all together so you can have an idea

**The brain is a prediction machine.** If I say "red," your brain might pull up: apple, terminus, blood, heart - putting all that together. These concepts aren't related to each other, but the brain says "I'm predicting your topic might be related to these issues."

### Intuition as Prediction

**Intuition** means **to stare at something very focused**. When you look deeply into something (like the color red), your brain can find all predictable information regarding red. That's why you can have intuition of something that's going to happen - **your brain is trying to bring all that information** to help you predict.

## The Heart: The Propulsion System

### How the Heart Works

The **heartbeat** is not because the heart is moving - it's because of the **pressure of the blood**. Depending on blood pressure, the heart beats faster or slower.

Blood pressure moves through the body via:
- **Veins and arteries** (tubes)
- The blood moves faster if they **open/expand**
- The blood moves slower if they **close/contract**

### The Role of Adrenaline

The veins and arteries expand or contract because of **adrenaline** produced in the **adrenal glands** (over the kidneys).

Adrenaline activates blood pressure around the body when:
1. Something is happening with no time to react
2. The brain captures this from the senses
3. Informs adrenal glands we need blood pressure
4. To prepare muscles, organs, bones, brain to be very active
5. For a fast action that cannot be meditated

The adrenaline pushes blood toward all organs and muscles so everyone has the pressure to work faster. This is why the heart starts to beat faster.

### When Adrenaline Activates

This blood pressure feeling and fast heartbeat can happen because:

1. **You're about to have an accident** - the body prepares for whatever will happen
2. **You're falling in love** - which for the body is almost the same as an accident

Both situations mean **you have no idea what's going to happen**. You have no idea how to react. So the body says "Okay, I have to put blood all over the body because I have no idea what's going to happen - just in case, the body must be prepared."

This is why when we fall in love, we feel the heartbeat - it's not because of love, it's because **the adrenal glands think we might die**. The body is saying "Oh my god, it's possible that I can die, I don't know what to do!"

(This takes all the romantic aspect away from love, but it's how it works.)

### What We Feel with Adrenaline

When adrenaline flows, we feel:
- **No limits**
- **Capable of anything**
- **We can do whatever**

This feeling of "I can do anything" is the circulatory system saying: **"Hey, do whatever because I am ready for everything. Don't worry, it will be okay no matter what happens. The solution will be perfect because I'm preparing the whole body. Everything is perfect and good."**

## Brain vs. Heart: The Dichotomy

### The Brain Says:

"Okay, I've seen this. Where have I seen this before? Let me look for information... I've seen it here, there, there, there, there, there. Oh okay, now I get it, now I know what this is about. **Be careful because I've seen this before.**"

### The Heart Says:

"Okay, I see the situation. I have no idea what it is, but I'm getting ready. I'm getting ready - **let's go! It doesn't matter if it's good or bad, I don't care, let's go!**"

### The Two Perspectives

**Positive people** (heart-focused) say: "It doesn't matter what happens, you have to move forward, you have to evolve, everything is going to be good. Live through the heart - the heart is the only way!"

**Mind people** (brain-focused) say: "Be careful, it's all good to go ahead, but you have to check every step. You have to know that maybe you can fall, so you have to be patient. Also, it's going to rain - do you have an umbrella? I've seen that happening. Be careful when you run under the rain because maybe lightning can fall on you. Also, you can get a cold. So just pay attention. It's okay to have feelings, but take it easy. Breathe. Think twice before you rush. **Control your emotions.**"

## Which Should I Follow?

**NEITHER.**

I should follow **none of them**. I have to **use them as tools**, not follow them.

### If I Follow the Mind/Brain:

- It will try to **control the emotions** of my heart
- Overthinking, over-analyzing
- Paralysis by analysis
- Missing opportunities through fear

### If I Follow the Heart:

- It will **just act without thinking**
- Like a bull charging ahead
- No strategy or planning
- Accidents and crashes inevitable

## The Balance: Intuition Driving the Hunch

**What I have to do is find the balance** - use both as tools.

### The Car Analogy

Picture it like this:
- The **hunch of the heart** = the **car**
- The **intuition of the mind** = the **driver**

**The driver by itself** (intuition alone) without the car cannot ride fast anywhere. It will take a long time to reach a place - walking is slow.

**The car by itself** (hunch alone) without a driver is **an accident for sure**. It will crash.

**I have to use the intuition of my mind to drive the hunch of my heart.** This is how I find balance between both.

## How Intuition and Hunch Work in the Universe

### Intuition: The Tuning Fork

**Intuition** is like a **tuning fork**:
- You have two tuning forks
- You hit one of them
- By **resonance**, it starts to vibrate the other exactly the same
- Imitating the same frequency by intuition

This is like one neuron connected to another neuron. They resonate in sync.

### Hunch: The Energy Hit

**Hunch** is the **energy that hits the tuning fork**. It's the strike, the impact that makes it vibrate. It's the positive energy that moves this vibration to create situations, to move forward.

**There is no vibration and resonance of intuition without the hit of energy that makes it vibrate.**

### They Need Each Other

Intuition and hunch **both need each other**:
- Intuition without hunch = no energy to activate
- Hunch without intuition = no direction, just chaos

**In order to develop my intuition, I need to follow my hunches.**

## The Icosahedron Geometry

According to Atlantean tradition, the **icosahedron** geometrical figure represents **water**. Its vertices point high like peaks of mountains toward the atmosphere, toward pure air and wind.

- **20 faces**
- **30 edges** = the path from the same dimension traveled by spirit, soul, and body (10, 10, 10)
- **12 vertices** = open the 12 portals of the sphere

The icosahedron's 30 sides contemplate the **negative and positive aspects** of dimensions and main chakras.

## Guided Meditation: Heart's Resonance with Earth

The meditation journey connects our heart pulse with Earth's heartbeat:

1. Begin as seed beneath mud, absorbing nutrients
2. Extend roots deep, leaves toward surface
3. Grow through the Tree of Life toward light
4. Flower above the forest, seeing savanna and animals
5. Rise higher, seeing rainforest, coast, ocean
6. Reach the skies, surrounded by sun, clouds, sky colors
7. Ascend to space, seeing Earth's light below
8. Circle the planet, seeing all continents
9. Recognize your **heart beats in resonance with Earth's heart**
10. From Earth's pulse comes your impulse to live

**Set the intention**: To follow my hunches with the guide of my intuition.

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Ye

**Statement:** I am the dimension of the soul

**Code:** The Icosahedron - representing water, with paths of spirit-soul-body through dimensional portals

**Meditation Focus:**
- Feel your heartbeat as Earth's heartbeat
- Recognize each pulse as direction in your life path
- Balance intuition (driver) with hunch (car)
- See with your heart in every direction
- Bring Earth's sphere to your heart chakra
- Allow the light to shine from your heart in all directions

**Daily Integration:**
- When you feel a hunch, pause and invite intuition
- When you have intuition, ask for hunch's energy
- Use brain as GPS, heart as engine
- Don't follow either - use both as tools
- Create balance between prediction and propulsion

**Reflection:** Neither the brain nor the heart should be our master - both are tools given to us for navigation through life. The brain predicts through pattern recognition and intuition, helping us see possible futures. The heart propels through feeling and hunch, giving us energy to move forward. When we balance these tools - using intuition to guide our hunches - we move through life with both wisdom and courage, both foresight and boldness. The key is not choosing one over the other but orchestrating them in harmony, like a skilled driver operating a powerful vehicle toward meaningful destinations.
