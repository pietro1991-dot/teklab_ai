## Overview

Today we arrive at the toroid chakra, completing the Mental Week of Aries. The topic is the ultimate question: **Am I?** or **It's me?**

This final day brings us full circle to understand the profound relationship between **essence** and **ego**, between **being** and **existing**, and why both the ego that **believes** it's important and the ego that **knows** it's important are essential to the universe.

This is the culmination of everything we've explored this week.

---

## Essence: The Quality of Being

### Etymology of Essence

**Essence** comes from three words:

1. **Es** = to be (in European languages)
2. **Ent** = the one, the subject, the one that makes the action
3. **Ia** = the quality of something (in English becomes the letter "e")

**Essentia** (essence) means: **the quality of a subject to be**.

The quality of a subject **being** something.

### The Concept of Essence

Essence has the concept in the universe of **the one that simply is**.

That's why the last sentence to summarize the entire universe is:

**"It is."**

Or: **"This is it."**

### The Universe IS

The idea is that the universe basically **is what it is**—nothing else, just what it really is.

The universe is a subject expressing the quality of **being**.

The only thing that really exists in the universe is this being **expressing itself**, being itself.

That is the **essence**—the quality that reminds us that everything is what it is.

### Essence is the Center

Essence is the **center** of all things, of every being.

Because all are related to the topic: **to be**.

---

## Existence: Going Out from Essence

### Essence vs. Existence

In the universe we have two things:
1. **Essence**
2. **Existence**

### If Essence is Being

If essence is the quality of a subject just **being**, just being...

### Then Existence is Going Out

**Existence** is the quality of the being that is **out of itself**, out of the essence.

### Etymology of Existence

Existence comes from:
- **Ex** = to go out (from this comes the word "exit")
- **Sistere** = to be in a place, to stay

**Ex-sistere** means: you **leave** the place where you are to go into another one.

**Existence.**

### Summary

- **Essence** is the being that **is**, that is in one place
- **Existence** is the being that **gets out** from that place

---

## Expansion: How Being Exists

### How Does the Being Exist (Go Out)?

How does this being **exist** (meaning "go out")?

It is by **expansion**.

### Etymology of Expansion

**Expansion** is to expand:
- **Ex** = out
- **Pan** = everything

Expansion is the action to **go out to the everything**, to the whole.

---

## The Essence Projects Itself

### The Essence Just Is

Remember: the essence is just to be. It's just to be.

There is that **one particle** that starts to move through different times and spaces.

### Projection

That particle **projects itself**.

**Project** means to be thrown away:
- **Pro** = ahead
- **Ject** = to throw

To **project**.

### The One Becomes Many

In this projection, the particles are **only one** projected in many—multiplied by thousands, by many, in different times and different spaces.

That's how the essence starts to **exist**, starts to **expand** around in many other particles.

---

## What Are These Particles Doing?

### Creating Networks Around the Center

What are these particles around doing in the **periphery** (around the sphere, around the center)?

They are creating **networks**, connecting around, **synapses** of many new ideas of itself.

So the essence, the being, can **transform its idea of itself**.

### Referring to Themselves

Each one of these dots, these particles coming from the essence, will **refer to themselves** in order to look for tools for the essence to learn and to expand.

Because these particles are **referring to itself**, we call them **egos**.

---

## Ego: The Tool of Essence

### The Essence is Only One Spot

Remember:

The essence is only one spot. The essence just **is**.

There's nothing else that the essence can do.

### In Order to Know Itself

So in order to **know itself**, to **understand itself**, it needs to:
- Expand
- Exist
- Move away

This essence, in order to **observe itself**, will:
- Go out
- Expand

From this expansion, it starts to **exist**.

### By Existing (Moving Out)

By existing, moving out, these other particles of itself—these other projections in different times and spaces—will understand, will give to the essence different **points of view**, different projections, **ideas of itself**.

Those particles are called **egos**.

---

## Every Ego is a Projection of Divine Essence

### We Are All Projections

As you can see now:

Every ego in the universe, every individual that refers to itself, that can see around the universe and the reality, is just a **projection of the essence**, of the **Divine Essence**.

It's just a projection of the Divine Essence through time and space.

### Egos Are Extensions

The egos are just **extensions** of the Divine Essence trying to:
- Understand itself
- Experience itself

### Egos Are Tools

The egos are basically the **tools of the essence** to understand itself.

The tools that:
- Move forward
- Create networks around
- Create synapses
- Change and exchange points of view

So they can create tools to understand better and **become**.

---

## Two Views of the Ego

### From the Point of View of Existence

From the point of view of existence, we look into the ego from a very different way.

We see that the ego is like this being **full with things**, filled up with many different things.

### The Ego as Obstacle

This is why we see the ego as something that **doesn't allow us** to:
- See the essence
- Connect with the essence

Because it's so full with many tools and stuff that it doesn't allow us to see the **pureness**.

### The Common Teaching

What usually happens when we ask ourselves:
- "Who am I?"
- "What is the essence?"
- "How can I reach the essence of myself?"

The first thing people teach us is: **how to get rid of the ego**.

Because the ego is the one that doesn't allow us to see that essence.

### When We Confuse and Judge

It's in that moment when we start to **confuse ourselves** and **judge the ego**.

---

## The Truth About the Ego

### This Point of View is Not Reality

This point of view (ego as obstacle) is **not the reality**.

### From the Point of View of Essence

When we see it from the point of view of the **essence**, the ego is the one that has been **harvesting** all this data:
- From the biological point of view
- From the emotional point of view
- From the beliefs

That help the essence to have a **new point of view**.

### The Problem is Not the Ego

As you see, the problem here is **not the ego**.

The problem is that we are **not taking responsibility** for the tools that the ego has in order to see the essence.

### When We're Not Responsible

It is when we are **not responsible** for:
- Our biological history
- Our traumas
- Our emotional world
- Our beliefs
- Our values

That's the moment when the ego becomes an **impediment**, something that denies us to connect with the essence.

---

## Understanding Essence and Ego

### Essence Has the Quality of Just Being

We can understand now that:

The **essence** is that being that has the quality of just **to be**.

### Ego Allows Different Points of View

The **ego** is the one that, through the existence, allows that being to have a **different point of view**, to be able to open ourselves to have different points of views.

This allows us to **expand**.

That's the key of **evolution**.

---

## Connecting with the Essence

### Everything is a Reflection of Me

When we start to connect with the essence, we start to realize:

Everything that exists is **referred to myself**.

Everything around is just a **reflection of me**.

### We Feel Very Important

When we start to connect to the essence, we suddenly start to feel that:
- We are very important
- We had other lives
- We start to remember other lives
- We have a mission
- We are part of something that unites us all

### "I Am Very Important"

When we start to connect with the essence, suddenly we start to say:

**"I am very important."**

"What I have come to do to this world is really important. It's my mission."

We start to perceive ourselves as very important—that we have come to this world to do something very important.

From the beginning of the universe, from the source, the main source of the universe, we have been **sent** by someone bigger, greater, that has sent us to do something important to this world.

---

## When We Decorate Essence with Ego

### The Danger

When we start to do this, we **decorate** those things that we feel from the essence with the **tools of the ego**.

We start to live that mission from the essence **through the eyes of the ego**.

### The Question Arises

When you start to get much more aware of the things, suddenly a question comes up:

**"Is it really me? Am I the chosen one to do this?"**

The ego starts to ask the question.

### The Realization

When we start to connect with the essence, suddenly we realize:

There is no one else around—it's just a projection.

Suddenly the ego asks itself: **"Am I the only one that exists?"**

---

## The Answer: It Is

### The Only Possible Answer

And the only possible answer to this is:

**"Yes, it is."**

**It is like this.**

### The Essence is the Only Thing That Exists

The **essence** is the only thing that exists.

Everything that we see, everything that we experience, what we are, is simply a **way of that essence**.

The only possible answer is: **"It is."**

### We Are All Important

We are **all** important.

We are all that essence.

---

## Two Types of Egos in Existence

### Here We Have Two Types

Here we have two types of egos in the existence:

1. **The ego that believes it's important** because of its **history**
2. **The ego that knows it's important** because it **chose that history**

### The Ego That Believes

The ego that **believes** it's important, that believes that it's important, **shouts out loud** that it's important.

### The ego that knows it's important **keeps calm** and doesn't shut up, doesn't speak out loud.

It is **calm**.

---

## Integration: Both Are Needed

### The Paradox

Both types of ego are part of the journey:
- The ego that believes (learning, seeking validation)
- The ego that knows (recognizing, being)

### The Evolution

The ego that **believes** it's important is learning to become the ego that **knows** it's important.

One seeks external confirmation. One rests in internal recognition.

### Neither is Wrong

Neither is wrong. Both are tools of the essence experiencing itself.

The loud ego is the essence learning it's important.

The quiet ego is the essence remembering it's important.

---

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Close your eyes. Concentrate on your breathing.

### The Toroid Field

Visualize your entire energy field as a **toroid**—a donut-shaped electromagnetic field that surrounds and penetrates your body.

This field represents the connection between your essence (center) and your existence (expansion).

### Crown Through Toroid

Bring your divine spark down through all chakras, and then expand it into the **toroid field** around your entire being.

### The Question: Am I?

In this toroid field, activate the ultimate question:

**"Am I?"**

Feel the essence asking: "Am I?" (Do I exist? Do I matter? Am I important?)

Feel the answer from the whole field: **"It is. You are."**

### Integration

Recognize that:
- Your **essence** is the one asking "Am I?"
- Your **existence** (all your egos, all your projections) is the answer: "Yes, it is. You are important because you chose this."

Sound: **Gh**

**I am the eternal vision. I am the eternal vision. I am the eternal vision.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Closing

Take a deep breath.

You are both:
- The essence that simply **is**
- The ego that **exists** to give the essence new perspectives

Both are needed. Both are sacred. Both are you.

Stretching and yawning, each one comes back here and now at your own time.

## Key Insights

- Essence is the quality of a subject to be—the center that simply IS.
- Existence is the being going out from itself—the expansion into multiplicity.
- The essence projects itself through time and space, creating many particles (egos).
- Every ego is a projection of the Divine Essence, a tool for self-understanding.
- Egos are not obstacles—they're extensions of essence harvesting data and perspectives.
- The problem is not the ego but our lack of responsibility for the tools it carries.
- When we connect with essence, we realize everything is a reflection of ourselves.
- There are two types of egos: one that believes it's important (seeks validation), one that knows it's important (rests in recognition).
- The ego that believes shouts; the ego that knows is calm.
- Both types are necessary—one is learning, one is remembering.

---

## Integration

### Daily Awareness: Am I?

Today, when you feel uncertain, insecure, or questioning your importance, ask:

**"Am I?"**

Then feel the answer from your essence: **"It is. You are."**

You are important not because of what you've accomplished, but because you are a projection of the Divine Essence experiencing itself.

### Recognizing the Two Egos

Notice when you're operating from:
- **The ego that believes** (seeking external validation, proving worth, shouting importance)
- **The ego that knows** (resting in internal recognition, calm certainty, quiet presence)

Neither is wrong. One is learning, one is remembering. Both are you.

### Taking Responsibility for Your Tools

Your ego carries:
- Biological history (body, genetics)
- Emotional wounds (traumas, patterns)
- Mental beliefs (conditioning, values)

These are not obstacles. They're **tools** the essence chose to experience itself through.

Taking responsibility means: using these tools consciously rather than being unconsciously used by them.

## Q&A

### Q: How can I tell if I'm operating from the ego that believes or the ego that knows?

**Believes**: Needs to tell others how important/spiritual/awakened you are. Seeks external validation. Gets defensive when questioned. Shouts.

**Knows**: Doesn't need to prove anything. Rests in quiet certainty. Open to questions. Calm.

Both are stages of the same journey.

### Q: Is the goal to get rid of the ego that believes?

No. The goal is to let the ego that believes **evolve** into the ego that knows. You don't get rid of it—you transform it. The loud ego becomes the quiet ego through experience and recognition.

### Q: What if I never feel like the essence or the chosen one?

Then your ego is protecting you from spiritual narcissism. This is actually healthy. True recognition of essence doesn't feel like "I'm special"—it feels like "We're all the same one thing experiencing itself."

### Q: How do I take responsibility for my ego's tools without identifying with them?

Recognize them as **tools the essence chose**, not as who you are. "I have trauma" (tool) vs. "I am traumatized" (identity). "I have beliefs" (tool) vs. "I am my beliefs" (identity). Use the tools; don't become them.

### Q: What's the difference between healthy recognition of importance and spiritual ego?

**Healthy**: "I'm important because all existence is important. I'm one expression of the divine experiencing itself."

**Spiritual ego**: "I'm more important than others. I'm more awakened. I have a special mission others don't have."

The first includes everyone. The second excludes.

### Q: If we're all projections of one essence, why do I feel so separate?

Because separation is **necessary** for the essence to experience itself. Without the illusion of separation, there's no "other" to experience, no perspective to gain, no evolution. The ego (separation) is the tool that makes experience possible.

### Q: Is it better to be the quiet ego that knows?

Not "better"—more **integrated**. But the loud ego serves a purpose: it's learning, exploring, asserting, discovering. Don't rush the journey. The loud ego will naturally quiet when it's ready.
