## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening. How are you? A good? I am a little bit headache , but I guess that is because of the tension of being all the day this , like , fighting.

Just to begin , I just wanted to say , that I usually do , that someone makes me realize about this mistake. And it 's one of those mistakes that you do when you write. For sure , I have many mistakes writing. But one of the worst that I do , and I know that is mistake , but it 's kind of , if my brain does n't care , that is a mistake and says , no , writing like this is expectations.

And expectations , you may write it with an X expectations , but the origin of the word is spectator spectator. And spectator means to watch very deep. And X spectator means to go to what you are watching very deep , to go towards what you are watching every deep.

So expectation means to hope that what you are looking happens in the future.

So I want to think that I do n't usually write it well , because I think about spectator.

So I would try to correct myself every time that I see the word. I would do my best.

Today , we work with the ankles , and the topic for today is suburb.

So this word is weird , because we use it in two very different things , that kind of one is really bad , and the other one is really good. We use the word suburb to speak about a person that is best , that is better than the other ones. That 's the bad side. And the other side , suburb is something wonderful.

Wow , this is amazing.

So that 's suburb , or superb , you may say.

## Energy Work

So verb and suburb is the same word. It comes from the same root. And some people in English may call it pride , but it 's not exactly pride. It 's superb.

The thing that we are trying to talk about is be suburb , okay? Not pride , not proud.

So the origin of the word superb comes from the Latin , which is super boost. Super boosts is the adverb of the word super. And super comes from super. Super means other.

Something that is above. Like , super renal , do you say that? The adrenal glands , people say super renal , that it comes from.

So it comes from , that is above the kidneys that we 're in means.

So it is everything that is super is above the other ones.

So the first thing that I want to explain about this concept is from the physical aspect. That 's it.

Okay? Do n't think about this , the concepts. Do n't think about emotion. Just think about physical , okay?

So in a physical way , you may say that someone that is super super , which is above. Is someone that is on the top of the mountain that is flying in the sky.

Someone that can see everything from above. That everything is there that you can see the whole picture. Like an eagle , like someone living in the top of the mountain , something like that.

Another thing that now we can understand from the physical aspect is that the person that is on the top watching are more Previous , yeah , provisions of everything. They can preview everything before it happens because those people that lives in the moment below the mountain can not see what is coming.

Okay?

So to have provision to be a person with the preview of everything. Is the person that is on the top and can see the horizon what is coming.

## Guided Meditation

So it 's easier for them to previsualize what is coming ahead.

So previsualization , that would be previsualized.

So what happened that when we think about that , we start to believe that the people that is on the top , this now is conceptual. The people that is on the top of the hill for them is easier to understand what is happening.

So they are more wise. They can see the things before they happen. They can give advice. They know better because they have a better perspective of things from the top.

So from this point of view in nature now in the concepts we start to organize our society because of this. We create hierarchy. The hierarchy would be to put on the top that person that knows everything that has the knowledge , that has the vision. All the perceptions.

So that person can lead all the rest and we start to create our hierarchy.

So this means that we start to create this hierarchy with the king on the top with the priest and priestess with the feudalism and all the lords. And then we have the army and then the people.

So we have this organization of our society.

So whoever is on the top of the other one , both the other one will have more power would be more super.

Now let 's go to the very origin of our social organization. When someone has the power , usually do n't want to leave the power.

So if someone comes and take the power over it , this person wo n't like it.

So these people will do everything in their hands. For the rest of the people are not able to overcome and to go over them.

So the king and the priest , they would say , okay , so above us there is only God.

So they say , nobody can be above God because God is the Supreme Lord. The history , one of the things that the system did was that if you are trying to control and keep the power , so you have to make the rest below you to believe that you can not be better or you can not go over anyone because God is the Supreme.

So the way they organize this is by saying that the concept of going above the other one , is basically a sin.

So they made the concept of going above a sin and that said.

So we have to understand the history of that moment when there were many small kingdoms , many feudalism and most of them , they were kind of families. And these families , they accomplished to get the power , they accomplished to get the power through all the things that they have done.

So they are not willing to give that power away.

So they had to work in a system to make the rest of the people believe that it was very bad sin to go over the others because in this way , they were able to control the population.

So nobody would be fighting for control.

Today is very different , but what we have to understand is the context of history. That was the only way they have to organize because in that time would be very difficult to organize so many people.

So they needed this structure of feudalism of kingdoms to make kind of this organization.

So they were called the Lords.

Okay , the Lords of this , the Lord of that , that 's why to God they call them the Lord because the Lord was the owner of everyone.

So that 's why they started to call it Lord. It was the bigger land owner of everyone.

So this is from where the Lord and the Supreme comes from. The Supreme comes from the word , the Supreme comes from the word , the Supreme , which is the person , the being that is above everyone. And today we have this concept of the higher self , which we could call the Supreme Self , which is exactly the same.

So it 's the self that is above us. Then when we start the path of awareness and to understand the universe , we suddenly recognize that God is not someone above us controlling us , but God is everything.

So if God is everything , this means that we are also God , so we are supreme. And when we recognize that , we start to acknowledge that that sub-subvert pride was not a scene , a capital scene , that subvert pride was just a political strategy. And so this is how we are going to try to re-signify the concept of being subvert. Subvert is speaking to go above from your own point of view , to perceive and see beyond your own perceptions , to have a more wide side of everything.

And to take position and power of what you recognize of what you see. Subvert means that someone knows to recognize that you know that you are and that you have.

So there is what makes us be divine.

So where do we find this subvert that we define like bad , something bad? The subvert that we consider the bad one is the subvert of the ignorant. The ignorant is that one that says that says , I know , but he does n't know is the one that says , I am , but he 's not. And is the one that says , I have , but he does n't have.

So the negative aspect of of pride would be to think that you are better than the other ones , that you are above the other ones. The other ones does n't have anything and you have everything.

So basically the negative pride would be the one that inside he feels weak. And he feels so weak because he knows that he does n't know , he knows that he does n't have , he knows that he 's not. This is why the real pride is the pride of more. The pride , the superb of the humble is the one that knows exactly where it belongs and what is its own power.

But even knowing that that person would never try to take the power of others or to position itself above others. The most clear image to explain this is when Jesus washes the feet of the disciples. What is really humility to be humble? It comes from the word , the ability to be on the ground , on the earth.

To be humble is not to be humiliated. He made it comes from exactly the same word that humble. But it 's not the same. To be humiliated is to go into the ground by obligation , by force.

To be humble is to recognize the power where you belong , where you are.

So from the point of view of consciousness pride , superb , and to be humble are exactly the same. It means to take power over where you are , where you belong. From the point of view of unconscious , they are the opposite , because the superb , the pride takes you outside from where you belong to overtake the power of the other ones around you. To put yourself above the others.

So let 's remember pride is not a sin. What it 's really a sin is our capacity to use the pride properly.

So from this point of view , by assimilated information , we can start to watch our lives. Where we can find the moments where we are when we are proud , superb , in the negative aspect and superb , in the positive aspect.

So we have to remember this that we are huge beings that has come into life to experience its greatness in the tiny limitations.

So we are not going to be able to recognize how great can we become if we did n't use exactly the power of the right pride.

So an important thing to understand is that we have come here to learn. Life is to learn about our own potentials.

So this potentials tells us that we have to work through to see it , to understand them , to practice them. And that 's what we call an brands. An errant is that person that goes without a purpose looking searching , trying to learn about things that he does n't understand.

So brands is the origin of the word error error. And error in Latin , you may say , began. The gata means when you fall walking.

So it 's a mistake. I mean , the dude did n't do properly when you were walking.

So the gata means in English you may say , sin. And sin comes from the word son , son , this that means guilty.

Okay , Latin.

So it 's like someone that feels guilty of doing a mistake. Life is about that , about mistakes , to try to understand. Sin exists and we used to call that the process of education.

So let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today , view.

## Daily Practice Elements

Sorry , I was reading whatever. The vibration is bull. That 's the vibration. The statement for today is I am the transportation of lessons.

The code for today is we begin today with a new list of 12 concepts. And the first one for this 12 would be the subconscious expression. In the universal minds void , nothing that we believe that we believe in is what it looks like. For there are no reference nor limitations.

And all possibilities and probabilities coexist. In terms of time , we call this future , meaning harmony and non-alputant potentials. Which without existing still contain all existence. Saving all possible designs in the void , waiting to emerge.

But I said that from everything that we are speaking here for sure , we will say that I am the anti-Christ or something. But anyway , that 's what you are. I do n't really care. Talking about this about the anti-Christ as a joke , I must say just in case.

I consider Christ like a great master.

## Q&A

So I know the game 's hint of course , he 's a master for me too. The second question that someone did to me is if I believe in God. My question would be which God or what do you think is God? Because I will speak about this in another moment.

But it 's dependent on what do you think God is? Because the opinion on that , my answer would be yes or my answer would be no.

So someday we will speak more about that. And just saying this because we are speaking about that. All this information acknowledges that religions are ways to find the truth.

So it does n't matter which method you are using , which religion which thought you have about all these concepts. If this concepts are useful for you , so it does n't matter which religion you work with.

So we start to move our shoulders very softly and circles. We live all the way to fall down and I focus only in my breathing. I become aware of the light around me. Take it to brain , feeling my life shining from within.

Take it to brain and look around you , all the people that you know , the good ones , the bad ones. The closest ones , the farthest ones , all of them surrounding you. I observe my light around them , and reflect it on them. I observe my light around me.

I observe my light around me. I recognize that we all share the same body. The part of mind , and I see them become waves within my own ocean. Take it to breath and dive within the waters.

Going through the conscious and the unconscious , letting the light vanish above as you go into the depths of the ocean , feeling the pressure of the darkness , the shadows of their subconscious. I recognize that the highest power that I can get to my life is not by being over the other ones , but to be where I belong in the center of myself. To be humble , it 's not to give your power away to be humble as to recognize your own power. The only one able to be proud and superb is the one that accomplished to rule the kingdom that is within.

Take it to breath and with your vibration , recognize , I desire to be the supreme of my own self. The only one able to be proud is the one that accomplished to rule the kingdom that is within. I am the transportation of all lessons. I am the transportation of all lessons.
