## Overview

Day 109 continues the reexamination of concepts we've been taught to despise, bringing us to **superb** (superiority) and **pride**—two closely related concepts that touch on hierarchy, leadership, and provision.

We've already explored pride on Day 103 (arrogance and pride), but today we go deeper into the specific flavor of pride that relates to being "above" others—what we might call superiority or being superb.

We work with the solar plexus chakra—the center of personal power, will, and the ability to provide and manifest in the world. The solar plexus governs how you use your power: Do you use it to dominate? To serve? To provide wisely? To inflate your ego?

The teaching today centers on a critical distinction:

**Destructive superiority:** Using your higher position/knowledge/power to dominate, control, or inflate your ego at others' expense.

**Wise provision:** Using your higher position/knowledge/power to provide for those who have less, serving from a place of responsibility and care.

Hierarchy exists. Some people genuinely have more wisdom, more resources, more capability in certain areas. The question is not whether hierarchy exists (it does), but **how you use your position in the hierarchy.**

---

## Core Teaching

### The Words: Superb and Pride

**Superb** comes from Latin *superbus*, meaning "elevated," "above," or "superior." It literally means being above something or someone else.

**Pride** (as we explored on Day 103) comes from roots meaning "to swell" or "to be full"—being full of oneself, full of one's own worth.

Both concepts involve elevation: being above, being full, being more.

In modern usage, both are condemned:
- "Don't be superior to others"
- "Pride comes before a fall"
- "Humility is virtue; pride is sin"

But like arrogance and hypocrisy, these concepts have been painted with broad, negative strokes that miss important nuances.

The question is not whether you're above others in some capacity (you might be—in wisdom, experience, resources, skill). The question is: **What do you do from that elevated position?**

### Hierarchy is Natural

This is uncomfortable for modern egalitarian sensibilities, but it's true: **Hierarchy exists naturally.**

In every domain:
- Some people have more wisdom than others
- Some have more experience
- Some have more resources
- Some have more skill
- Some have more knowledge
- Some have more capacity

This doesn't mean some people are inherently more valuable as souls—all beings are equal in essence. But in manifestation, in the 3D world, there are natural hierarchies of development, capability, and access to resources.

A parent knows more than a child. A teacher knows more than a student. An elder has more experience than a youth. Someone who has climbed the mountain knows more than someone still at the base.

**The hierarchy itself is not the problem.** The problem is how you use your position in the hierarchy.

### Two Uses of Hierarchy

**1. Destructive superiority (ego-based):**
- Using your elevated position to dominate others
- Making others feel small to make yourself feel big
- Hoarding resources and wisdom instead of sharing
- Looking down on those "below" you with contempt
- Expecting others to serve you because you're "above" them
- Inflating your ego through comparison

This is what we typically mean by negative pride or superiority. It's using hierarchy to feed ego, to control, to separate. This is harmful.

**2. Wise provision (service-based):**
- Using your elevated position to provide for those who have less
- Sharing resources and wisdom freely
- Taking responsibility for those in your care
- Looking at those "below" you with compassion and care
- Serving others from your elevated position
- Using your power to lift others up

This is what Matias calls "superb" in its positive sense—the wise use of superior position. This is healthy and necessary.

### The Mountain Metaphor

Matias uses a beautiful metaphor to explain this:

Imagine you've climbed a mountain. You're at a higher elevation than those still on the lower slopes or at the base.

From your elevated position, you can:

**Option 1 (Destructive):** Look down at those below and think, "Look how much better I am than them. I'm superior. They're inferior. They should worship me for being up here."

**Option 2 (Wise):** Look down at those below and think, "I can see farther from here. I know what's ahead. I can help guide them. I can share what I've learned. I can provide from my position."

Both involve hierarchy—you ARE higher on the mountain. But the way you use that elevation is completely different.

Wise provision says: "I've reached this height. From here, I can serve. I can provide. I have responsibility for those coming behind me."

Destructive superiority says: "I've reached this height. This proves I'm better. I deserve special treatment. Others should serve me."

### The Etymology of "Expectation"

Matias dives into an interesting etymological point: **Expectation** comes from Latin *ex-* (out of) + *spectare* (to look).

To expect literally means "to look out from"—to look out from an elevated position, to have a wider view.

When you've climbed higher on the mountain, you can "look out" farther. You can see what's coming. You can anticipate. You have expectation (broader vision).

This is not arrogance—it's literally the result of elevated position.

The person at the base of the mountain cannot see as far. They don't have the same expectation (outward-looking vision) because they don't have the elevation.

If you're at the top and they're at the bottom, you SHOULD have different expectations (different visions) because you have different vantage points.

**The problem comes when you use your wider vision to judge those with less vision, rather than to help guide them.**

### Pride as Provision

Here's the reframe:

**Pride, in its healthy form, is the responsibility that comes with elevated position.**

You're proud not because you're better than others, but because you've been given (or have earned) a position from which you can provide. You're full of your capacity to serve from that position.

A parent should be proud—not in the sense of ego inflation, but in the sense of taking responsibility for providing for their children from their elevated position (more knowledge, more resources, more capability).

A teacher should be proud—taking responsibility for sharing wisdom from their elevated understanding.

A leader should be proud—taking responsibility for guiding from their elevated perspective.

**Pride = taking responsibility for wise provision from elevated position.**

This is healthy. This is necessary. Without this kind of pride, those in elevated positions shirk their responsibility. They don't provide. They don't serve. They abandon those who depend on them.

### The Solar Plexus and Power

The solar plexus governs personal power, will, and the ability to manifest and provide.

When the solar plexus is imbalanced:

**Deficient (weak):** You refuse your elevated position even when you have it. You shrink. You refuse to provide even when you're capable. This is false humility that abandons those who need your guidance.

**Excessive (inflated):** You use your elevated position to dominate and control. You inflate your ego through superiority. This is destructive pride that harms those you should be serving.

**Balanced:** You acknowledge your elevated position where you have it, and you use that position to provide wisely for those who have less. You serve from your power rather than dominating with it.

### When You're Not at the Top

Important point: Sometimes you're the one higher on the mountain. Sometimes you're the one lower.

When you're lower in the hierarchy (less wisdom, less resources, less experience in a particular domain):

**Unhealthy response:** Resent those above you, refuse to learn from them, reject all hierarchy out of wounded pride.

**Healthy response:** Recognize their elevated position, receive their provision gratefully, learn from their wider vision, while maintaining your inherent worth as a being.

You can honor someone's superior position in a specific domain without diminishing your own value as a soul.

The student honors the teacher's knowledge without being "less than" as a person.

The child honors the parent's wisdom without being worth less as a being.

### The Danger of False Egalitarianism

Modern culture often promotes the idea that "everyone is equal in all ways" and that any acknowledgment of hierarchy is problematic.

But this creates confusion and harm:

- It prevents wise people from providing guidance (they're afraid of seeming superior)
- It prevents capable people from taking leadership (they don't want to be seen as "above" others)
- It creates resentment (people with less experience demand equal authority in domains where they lack competence)
- It denies the natural truth that development happens at different rates

**Spiritual equality** (all souls are equally valuable) is true.

**Manifest hierarchy** (some people are more developed in specific areas) is also true.

Both can be true simultaneously.

You can honor someone's superior position in a domain while recognizing that your essence is equally divine.

### Transforming Destructive Pride into Wise Provision

If you find yourself in an elevated position (more wealth, more knowledge, more power, more wisdom in some area), the work is:

**1. Acknowledge the position honestly**
- Don't pretend you're not elevated when you are
- False humility serves no one

**2. Recognize it as responsibility, not proof of superiority**
- You've been given/earned this position to serve, not to dominate
- Elevation = responsibility for provision

**3. Provide from your position**
- Share resources
- Share wisdom
- Guide those coming behind you
- Use your power to lift others

**4. Stay humble about the source**
- Whatever elevated you (talent, effort, privilege, grace) is partly beyond you
- You're a steward of the position, not ultimately deserving or entitled
- Gratitude, not arrogance

**5. Remember you're also lower in other hierarchies**
- In some domains you're the teacher; in others you're the student
- This keeps perspective
- No one is superior in all ways

## Practice

### Wise Provision Meditation (Solar Plexus)

This practice helps you transform destructive pride into wise provision.

**Preparation:**
- Sit comfortably
- Place hand on solar plexus (above navel, below ribcage)
- Breathe deeply
- Set intention: "I use my power to serve"

**The Practice:**

1. **Identify your elevated positions** (7 minutes)
   - In what areas are you higher on the mountain than others?
   - Where do you have more: knowledge, experience, resources, skill, wisdom?
   - Don't be falsely humble—acknowledge where you're genuinely elevated
   - Examples: parent (elevated over your children), expert in your field, financially stable (elevated over those struggling), emotionally mature (elevated over those less developed)
   - List 2-3 areas where you have elevated position

2. **Notice your current use** (6 minutes)
   - For each elevated position, ask: How am I using this position?
   - Am I using it to dominate, control, or inflate my ego? (Destructive)
   - Am I using it to provide, guide, and serve? (Wise)
   - Am I shrinking from it, refusing the responsibility? (Deficient)
   - Be honest—no judgment, just awareness

3. **Feel destructive pride** (5 minutes)
   - If there's an area where you're using position destructively:
   - Feel how it feels in your solar plexus
   - Usually: inflated, tight, superior, separated
   - Notice the ego's attachment to being "better than"
   - Breathe into the feeling

4. **Transform to wise provision** (10 minutes)
   - For each elevated position, ask:
   - "How can I provide from here?"
   - "Who depends on my wisdom/resources/guidance from this position?"
   - "What responsibility comes with this elevation?"
   - Visualize yourself using your position to serve:
     - Sharing resources generously
     - Offering wisdom freely
     - Guiding with patience
     - Lifting others up with your power
   - Feel how this feels: full, responsible, connected, purposeful
   - This is healthy pride—pride as provision

5. **Acknowledge where you're lower** (5 minutes)
   - Now identify areas where you're lower on the mountain
   - Where do others have more wisdom, resources, skill than you?
   - Can you receive their provision gratefully?
   - Can you honor their elevated position without diminishing yourself?
   - Practice: "In this area, you are my teacher. I receive your wisdom with gratitude."

6. **Balance** (5 minutes)
   - Solar plexus glowing
   - See yourself in the flow of hierarchy:
     - Providing to those below (in certain domains)
     - Receiving from those above (in other domains)
     - All part of the natural flow of wisdom, resources, and service
   - No one is superior in all ways
   - Everyone serves and everyone receives
   - This is balance

7. **Integration** (3 minutes)
   - Hand on solar plexus
   - Commit: "I will use my elevated positions to provide wisely, not to dominate"
   - Commit: "I will receive from others' elevated positions with gratitude, not resentment"
   - Breathe deeply
   - Open eyes

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Hierarchy Awareness:**

Make two lists:

**Where I'm Higher (Elevated Positions):**
- List areas where you have more wisdom/resources/skill than others
- For each, ask: "Am I providing wisely, or using this to inflate ego?"
- Commit to one action of wise provision in each area this week

**Where I'm Lower (Receiving Positions):**
- List areas where others have more wisdom/resources/skill than you
- For each, ask: "Am I receiving their provision with gratitude, or resenting the hierarchy?"
- Commit to receiving gracefully in these areas

This builds awareness of the natural flow of hierarchy and your role in it.

### Weekly Focus

You're nearing the end of Scorpio week (Day 9 extended). You've explored emotions and concepts that are usually condemned or hidden. Now you're learning that many of these (pride, superiority, hierarchy) are not inherently bad—they become destructive only when misused.

The path is not to eliminate hierarchy or refuse elevation. The path is to use your elevated positions wisely, for service and provision, not domination and ego.

### Living the Teaching

Notice when you feel superior to someone. Don't judge yourself—just notice. Then ask:
- Is this true elevation (I genuinely have more wisdom/resources in this area)?
- Or is this ego comparison (I'm trying to feel better by making them lesser)?

If it's true elevation:
- How can I serve from this position?
- What provision can I offer?

If it's ego comparison:
- Release it
- Remember: I'm also lower in many other areas
- Everyone is your teacher in some domain

Also notice when you resent someone else's elevated position. Ask:
- Can I receive their provision with gratitude?
- Can I honor their wisdom without diminishing my own worth?

This is balanced solar plexus—wise use of power in all directions.

## Q&A

**Q: Isn't all hierarchy just social construction that should be dismantled?**

A: Some hierarchies are socially constructed and harmful (based on race, gender, arbitrary power). But some hierarchies are natural and necessary (based on development, skill, wisdom). A child genuinely needs guidance from an adult. A student genuinely needs teaching from someone with knowledge. Dismantling all hierarchy would prevent necessary provision and guidance. The work is to distinguish: Which hierarchies serve? Which ones harm?

**Q: How do I know if I'm using my position wisely or just rationalizing ego?**

A: Check your intention and impact. Wise provision: your intention is to serve, and your impact is that others are lifted up, empowered, guided. Ego-driven superiority: your intention is to feel better about yourself, and your impact is that others feel diminished, controlled, or resentful. Also check your body: wise provision feels full and responsible; ego feels inflated and superior.

**Q: What if I'm in an elevated position I didn't earn (privilege, inheritance, etc.)?**

A: Even more reason to use it wisely. You didn't earn it, so it's clearly given to you for stewardship, not ego. Provide generously from what you've been given. Share the privilege. Use the unearned position to serve. This transforms privilege from shame or arrogance into responsibility.

**Q: Doesn't this teaching justify oppressive hierarchies?**

A: No. Oppressive hierarchies use force and systemic harm to maintain dominance—that's destructive superiority, not wise provision. Natural hierarchy based on development/skill/wisdom serves; oppressive hierarchy based on power/violence/systemic control harms. The teaching is: Use natural elevated positions to serve, and dismantle oppressive hierarchies that harm.

**Q: What if someone in an elevated position isn't using it wisely? Should I still honor it?**

A: You can honor the position (teacher, parent, leader) without honoring the specific person's misuse of it. Respect the role while setting boundaries with the individual. And sometimes the wisest response is to remove someone from an elevated position if they're abusing it. Hierarchy should serve; when it doesn't, it needs to change.

**Q: How is this different from Day 103's teaching on arrogance and pride?**

A: Day 103 focused on reclaiming personal authority and self-trust (individual path to consciousness). Today focuses on using elevated position in relationship to others (hierarchical responsibility). Both challenge the blanket condemnation of pride, but from different angles: individual authenticity (Day 103) vs. relational provision (Day 109).

**Q: Can I have healthy pride without comparing myself to others?**

A: Yes. Healthy pride is being full of your own capacity and taking responsibility for wise use of it. It's not about being "better than" others—it's about honoring what you have and using it well. You can be proud of your wisdom/skill/growth without needing anyone to be lesser for you to be elevated.

**Q: What's the relationship between this teaching and humility?**

A: True humility is not denying your elevated position or refusing to provide from it. True humility is recognizing that whatever elevated you is partly beyond you (gift, grace, effort + luck), using your position to serve rather than dominate, and remembering you're also lower in other hierarchies. Humility and wise provision coexist—you can provide from elevated position while staying humble about the source.

## Closing Reflection

Day 109 brings you to one of the final days of Scorpio week, examining superiority and pride through the lens of hierarchy and provision.

The modern world has taught you that all hierarchy is bad, that any sense of being "above" others is arrogance, that pride always leads to downfall. But this teaching reveals the nuance:

**Hierarchy exists.** In some domains, you are higher on the mountain. You have more wisdom, more resources, more capability. This is not inherently wrong—it's natural in the development of consciousness and skill.

**The question is: What do you do from that elevated position?**

You can use it to dominate, control, and inflate your ego—this is destructive superiority, and it harms.

Or you can use it to provide, guide, and serve—this is wise provision, and it's necessary.

The person who has climbed higher on the mountain can look down with contempt ("Look how much better I am") or with care ("I can see what's ahead; I can help guide you"). Same elevation, completely different use.

**Healthy pride is taking responsibility for wise provision from your elevated position.**

Not pride as ego inflation, but pride as stewardship—being full of your capacity to serve from where you are.

Your solar plexus governs this power. When it's balanced, you neither shrink from your elevated positions (false humility) nor dominate from them (inflated ego). You provide wisely, generously, responsibly.

And you remember: in some domains you're the teacher; in others, you're the student. Sometimes you provide; sometimes you receive. Everyone is higher and lower in different areas. This is the natural flow.

The path is not to eliminate hierarchy or refuse elevation. The path is to use your elevated positions to serve, to lift others, to provide from what you've been given or earned.

This is the wisdom of the mountaintop: seeing farther, expecting more (wider vision), and using that sight to guide those still climbing.

*Day 109: Transforming superiority into wise provision from elevated perspective.*
