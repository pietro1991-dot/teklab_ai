## Introduction

Hi everyone , good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So let 's begin with our topic for today related to the scrum and the topic is the vegetable world. And of course what we are going to talk about is what is the vegetable consciousness. I guess that you have seen in the post that it turned out to be a very botanist point of view of the information today.

So what is the vegetable consciousness and why we have to incorporate that in our own training? The first thing that we have to understand from the vegetable consciousness is what vegetables are given to us , which are two main things and bread.

## Guided Meditation

So these are the things that we gain from the plants from the vegetable kingdom. All the living beings need to survive to exist and every living being needs to breathe in order to survive. We usually say that we all need the vegetable kingdom in order to survive. We need stuff from them.

But actually let 's change the point of view of the sentence. It 's not that they have stuff for us to live.

So we need from them in order to live. But the thought would be that we exist because they just had so many things to give. And it 's a different perspective. Because when we see it from our point of view , like we need from the plants in order to survive , the thought is weird because it 's like if we were in need of something , so we have to create plants in order to have the bread and the food.

But that 's not it. The reality is that the plant has had so much abundance that all the things that they just gave away were taken by other beings that became the animals.

So there are abundance that we exist. It 's not that we need them. It 's just that we exist because of them. And this is the first thing that we have to acknowledge to understand this importance of the vegetable consciousness.

So let 's go to the origin of the vegetable kingdom.

So what we have to do in order to go to the origin of the vegetable kingdom is to go back in time , 4,000 billion years.

So remember that at the very beginning of this world , there was nothing on the ground. It was all dry , both canon and heat deserts and that 's it. Suddenly the condensation of the chemicals in the atmosphere started to become rain. And it rained for thousands and even millions of years until it was all full with water.

What was called the first oceans? But these oceans were not clean. These oceans had so many chemicals and toxins and many heavy metals that were falling from the sky.

So it was not the best environment.

So all these chemicals that were falling in the water , they were brought to the bottom of the oceans. There are many other volcanoes where still heat in the waters. All these different chemicals started to mix to one another and they started to fish in. They kind of melt to one another.

This melting process made that the chemicals started to combine to one another in a different way , in a different structure. Suddenly this inner organic structures that created minerals and crystals , as I explained yesterday , heavy structures could n't really keep their heavy structure. And they just started to mix and transform one to another. And the water , the hot water , allowed that to flow constantly and just becoming minerals.

So this fusion , what created is this new state of chemicals in which it 's not any more inner organic but it becomes organic.

So organic is like an organism that starts to flow and move.

So what made this minerals chemicals organic? It was because of the exchange of electrons.

So they started to change the exchange electrons to one another.

So that meant they started to share electricity. They started to share pulses of movement. And this allowed them to share data information constantly between them.

So they could find better ways to organize in a new structure.

So 4,000 million years ago , what happened is that some of those chemical elements started to create an organic shield that was protecting the other minerals inside. There was coal as hell. And this first cell is what we call a cyanobacteria. I do n't know if it 's right pronounced but Piano or cyanobacteria.

Cyanobacteria.

So what happened is that cyanobacteria is absorbed inside like eaten by the chloroplase that is chemical structure that will encode. What this cyanobacteria has is that it is shaped by a lot of magnesium. And magnesium is organized in a structure that can absorb and capture all the photons in the environment. The magnesium able capture all the rays of light.

And remember that the goal of the cell was to have energy needs a lot of energy. If it is not taking the energy from the other minerals , so it will take it from another source , which was the Sun. Magnus started to administrated all this energy. And it started to accumulate a lot of energy within a cell.

This light that is storage by the magnesium , and it 's moving around because of the magnesium , reflects inside the chloroplast through the chloro. Chloro is a chemical component which is part of the chloroplast. And what it happens is that the light accumulated there is reflected in the structure in the chemical structure of the chloroplast. And the chloro is a chemical structure that when light hits it , it starts to to move in a wavelength of 500 nanometers , which is the color green.

So we see the light reflecting in that wavelength with the color green. And that 's why the pigment of the chloroplast is called chlorofilah. I do n't know the name in chlorofil.

Okay , here 's a chlorofil. The chlorofil is this pigment , which is not real green , but we see it as green because of the reflection of the chloro. And the chlorofil is the reason why we see the plant green.

So it 's lots of those about these botanist things , but anyway , and trying to summarize it.

So do you remember why the cell needed this light to make a process that we call photosynthesis? What is the process of photosynthesis?

Remember , magnesium will accumulate light. This light is called photons in Greek. That 's why photosynthesis.

So light. And this light will be transformed into energy. But in order to be storage in energy , it needs molecules to be assimilated as one.

So that 's why a leaf plant will need minerals made of carbon and water , hydrogen and oxygen. And from the air , carbon dioxide.

So it will breathe and drink these things in order to get the carbon and the hydrogen to much energy.

So the result of this will be carbohydrates , which the one that accumulates the energy. And the oxygen , the three molecules of the gen will be to the environment , you do n't need them.

So in this process of photosynthesis , two important things happen. A huge source of energy was storage and a huge amount of oxygen released.

So now in this whole ocean , we start to have millions and billions of new cells that starts to do photosynthesis because they realize that they have much more light from the much more energy , from the sun than from any other chemical element that they can find around. This cyanobacteria bacteria , they start to duplicate and for millions of years , start to make the process of photosynthesis , creating billions of them that we call Peter Canton. What is the Canton? Peter means plant and Canton means lost crazy.

## Energy Work

The plant is not a big problem. Why? Because these are plants without roots and they are aga that goes everywhere and they do n't have a goal , they do n't have a , sorry , they do n't have a a place to go.

Okay , so they are lost around.

So they are brought by the currents of the ocean without any place to go. The crazy thing about Peter Canton is that they where the first thing that populated the world and they are still populated very much the world. Peter , you check Peter Canton from space in images in Google , you will find amazing treasures of this Victor Canton from the space that covers huge regions and you can see them like the northern lights from the oceans.

So it 's amazing how they move and how you can see it. The Peter Canton is very sensitive to temperature.

So if ever it is a heat in the planet or like a global warming , , Peter Canton can die in huge massive amounts and that 's a real problem for everyone.

## Guided Meditation

So I will explain why. What is the important thing to know about the Peter Canton? That this , this plans here are covering territories in the ocean bigger than any forest and ever any forest. Territories so huge that are bigger than bigger than the Congo , the Amazon so they are releasing so much oxygen to the environment , so much oxygen , that that all the oxygen that we breathe is because of them.

So without Peter Canton , no oxygen.

So of course they release two kind of things one is O2 which is oxygen and O3 which is ozone.

So it 's just a bit much more pure the ozone than the oxygen.

So at the beginning of time Peter Canton was the only thing around.

So that was the beginning of the algae. This huge amount of Peter Canton that are in the world that was millions of years ago in the world was creating a amount of energy in the environment by the O3 and O2 , ozone and oxygen and a amount of energy by the carbohydrates that they were accumulating vitamins , minerals and everything.

So it was a lot huge amount of this. When we got all this Peter Canton in the environment , suddenly we had a huge amount of energy right there.

So some bacteria , they started to find out that they did n't have to many photosynthesis to reach this energy because it was already possessed here , aside.

So that 's why some bacteria started to eat the phytoplanton to rub this energy from the carbohydrates and vitamins and so on. And also using the energy of the oxygen and oxygen and ozone to move to create impulses to move.

So this new bacteria found out that they could push themselves to move with the pulses of the oxygen as they were storage energy in the shape of carbohydrates.

So this is how from the phytoplanton the sole plant on emerges.

So the sole plant starts to move around because they are using the energy that the plants are not using , which is the oxygen. But they are called sole plant because they also let themselves move with the currents of the ocean to follow where the phytoplanton is going. The phytoplanton allowed the existence of sole plant because of the abundance , the problems and the sole plant started to meet the phytoplanton in order to leave.

So what happened now? Of course the next.

So let 's imagine that this is the ocean and this is the bot solution. That 's the coast.

So the phytoplanton will be moved by the currents of the ocean wherever they take.

So they start to fill up all the oceans , the space of the ocean. Sadly after all this what happened was that there was a really big cold. And this really big cold was the glaciation. The biggest glaciation you can imagine.

The 90 % of the planet was covered on ice. This is related to the quantity of oxygen that was released to the environment. What happened when the oceans , when the poles froze , the level of water goes down too. But also this happens.

When the ocean went down , a lot of this aga got stuck in some lakes and the ground.

So what they found out is that when they were closer to the shore , they got much more light.

So they started to get stuck in the shores so they do n't have to go so taking by the ocean.

## Energy Work

So they started to create roots. And of course they were so many that started to grow up in order to find much more quantity of light. And this starts to create the vegetable kingdom. And of course the salt plant also started to follow the plants to the ground and they became the animal kingdom.

And all these animal kingdom were following the plants in the research of carbohydrates and oxygen.

So remember that the way a plant exists is because of exchange of data , of information , because everything are the seeds as a cell , because the minerals needed to exchange nutrients.

So it 's all about data.

So this is why each one of the plants it 's a connector and a channeled of energy in order to send data along the environment. And connecting a net of data with each one of the roots of the plants that are in the world.

So if each plant is creating a network of data and information sharing electrons and energy , this means that in the entire planet the vegetable kingdom is nerve the central nerve system of the earth. As I explained yesterday about the minerals that they storage information will the plants are sharing information and expanding that data. They are the network of murals. And we humans we eat that information.

We animals.

Sorry. We eat that information.

So we animals we eat these carbohydrates and all this information that were meant to become a new museum.

So all information are in seed and those seeds are meant to be new trees , new plants.

So that 's why when we eat them we got all the information become a new neuron to create neurons to exchange much more data information. And that 's how we develop brains , our pulses , thoughts.

So what I was saying is that the plants assimilate the light. The difference between the plants and the animals is that the plants assimilate the light and we look for the light. We are sick and for light. As the plants just become the light.

The vegetable and the animal are different because vegetable are outautrophos. I do n't know how I 'm saying. I 'm saying. I 'll put those.

Okay. Outautrophos. Meaning that they find the food inside within by themselves.

So they eat light which is within. And in the animal kingdom we are at the root of , at the root of. Meaning that we look for something outside that we look for something different to eat. We do n't eat inside ourselves.

We do n't produce our own food. In the middle we can find the fungi where the mushrooms are. And fungi , what is amazing is that we usually think that we are that they are vegetables , but they are not. They are much more clear to the animal kingdom because they eat different things and they do n't make photosynthesis.

## Practice Structure

And the structure of their skin are much more related to the animals than the vegetables.

Remember that the fungi , they eat organic matter like dead bodies , trance , other plants , but they do n't make photosynthesis.

Okay.

So we have here an important key. The vetatalkingdom is light. The animal kingdom seek the light. This means that animals we have been designed through life in order to look for the light , to look for the things , the clergy.

And the world of vegetables , they know how to produce the light , how to use the light in order to produce the power within themselves.

So the vegetable consciousness , what is trying to teach us , is to become a network of light.

So when we communicate with the plants , we connect with the plants , we are able to contact with the network of light. We can communicate with the entire network. In Major Himblas de Air , it 's another one.

So if our major goal as a human is to enlightenment , the only master we can follow is a tree. To become a tree to become a where of the major consciousness is to be able to recognize ourselves as light , to share that light , which is the wisdom that we have inside with everybody , not expecting anything in this change.

So now I want to clarify this regarding not expecting anything in this change , because when humans start to walk the spiritual path , usually when you listen to that sentence , it 's like if you do n't need anything and you have to give everything away. And it 's not that for a tree to be many things , for the tree to give fruits and seeds without expecting anything. They need a lot of matter , which is water , which is minerals , they storage a lot of things in order to produce something that then they will give to everybody.

So it 's not about given without taking , without receiving , it 's about not expecting to receive in the exchange , but you will need things in order to do.

So that 's important to understand in this spiritual path. As an example for example myself , I am here doing this every day , but I give in all this , without expecting anything from you. I do n't expect anything change every day that I give something. But the reason why I am here every day , given something for everyone , is because the members of the SA Foundation , without the members in the SA Foundation , I would n't be able to be here every day 24 hours through this.

So it 's because of that energy that I am able through this every day.

So instead of just thanking me , thanks to all the members of the Foundation that are allowing me to do this , otherwise I would have to be doing other things , working and another things , I repeat , to give without expecting anything in exchange , it does n't mean that you do n't have to receive.

Okay? And regarding the vegetable consciousness , what better example than start to pay attention to the trees , to look into the plants , learn how they work and start to imitate what they do. The best advice I could give you is be a tree. The vibration today is pure.
