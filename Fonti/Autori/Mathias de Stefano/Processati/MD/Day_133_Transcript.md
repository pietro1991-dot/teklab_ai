# Day 133 - Future and the Throat Chakra

**Author:** Matias de Stefano  
**Series:** 365 Days The Path Of I Am  
**Source:** Day 133 Transcript - Sagittarius Month, Throat Chakra, Emotional Week (recorded after solar eclipse experience)

## Daily Practice Elements

- **Chakra Focus:** Throat
- **Week Theme:** Emotional Week - Sagittarius Month
- **Main Topic:** Future and Time
- **Vibration:** Ve
- **Statement:** I am the legacy of realities
- **Code:** Color Black - Ligament is nothing more than the reunion with the profound void. By going back to the source where all things converge, white and black are one and no color exists - or they are simple perceptions of the wavelength of our vibration. Black is the sum/condensity of all realities. White is the sum of all their vibrations. But both are the set of the whole of the vibration of the entire cosmos.

## Overview

After an intense eclipse experience in the sarcophagus, where Matias received his personal message from the future, we explore the true nature of time. We learn that from the universe's perspective, the first time is actually the future (not the past), because in the beginning there was only void and potentiality - everything was "about to exist." We discover that past, present, and future are just human concepts based on our third-dimensional perception, and that eternity cannot be divided. Most importantly, we learn that future is not a place or destination - it's the inner transformation of a being, the potentially of what we can become.

## Context: After the Eclipse - Personal Processing

Matias is visibly affected by the intense eclipse experience the day before. He shares:

- He cried more than he has in a long time
- The sarcophagus was completely wet with tears
- He felt like he truly died
- He feels much more responsibility but also relieved of a great weight
- He received his message from the future but will process it privately before sharing
- He felt the expansion and could sense all those connected to the network

**He emphasizes:** This was one of the most difficult but necessary experiences.

## The Three Divisions of Eternity

### From Our Third-Dimensional Perspective

The perception we have of future is that it is **one of the times in which we divide eternity**.

We divide eternity into:
1. **Past**
2. **Present**  
3. **Future**

**But that's from the point of view of our third dimension.**

The reason why we divide eternity in three is because of our point of view of the third dimension. Remember: the third dimension is called like this because it has **three dimensions** - height, depth, and width.

**So these three dimensions for us is our reality. When we try to look into time, we project that in those three visions. That's why we divide eternity into three: past, present, and future.**

### Time Adapts to Each Dimension

For every dimension, time would be adapted according to that dimension.

We humans live in the third dimension, so we divide time into three. But beings in other dimensions would divide time differently according to their dimensional perspective.

## The Universe's Perspective on Time

### In the Beginning: Only the Void

When we spoke about the origin of the universe, we said that **the core of the universe is the void**, and this void from the inside projects into the outside.

When it goes into the outside, it projects **all the potentialities that the universe had within**.

In the beginning of the universe, this means:
- There's nothing
- There doesn't really exist anything
- There is only void and just projections

**This means the only thing that exists in the very beginning of the universe is the POTENTIALLY of the universe.**

### The First Time is Future

**From the point of view of the origin of the universe:**

**The FIRST time is the FUTURE.**

The second time is the past.

The third one is the present - which is the comprehension of the future and the past.

### Why Future Comes First

The reason why the future is the first one is because:

**There's nothing in the universe, only ideas that want to be projected in the outside.**

**The first time is the future because everything is "about to exist."**

**That's why we all are products of the future.**

### The Creation of Past and Present

Once we started to take action, to live, to experience these projections of the future, **we create the past**.

We leave the structure.

Then when we **become aware of that structure** and from where it comes from, **we live the present**.

## The Eternal Cycle

### Expanding and Contracting

The future expands itself in the past.

Then when we arrive in the present, we start to **go back to the origin of the things**.

**It's like we express and then we go back as an echo again.**

That means: **Once we are in the present, we start to come back to the future.**

**That's why we live looking into the future - because we are going back to the original.**

### Cultural Perspectives on Future

In our perception, future is something we put ahead, and we are going to it, but we don't know what is going to happen. It's just a projection, an idea.

**For some cultures:** The future is in front because we are heading to it.

**For other cultures:** The future is behind because they say "I don't see it, so I don't know what is going to happen."

## The Impossibility of Measuring Time

The complicated part is that **this eternity that we divided in three (past, present, future) - they are just concepts** because you cannot measure past or future.

### What is Past or Future?

For example, what I am doing now - this movement - is already in the past.

So is that past? Or what is past? Is it ancient time? Or is it just this movement I just did?

And the future? What is the future? Is it exactly the next movement I'm going to do after the past?

### Everything is All Three Constantly

**Basically, everything is past and present and future at the same time. Constantly.**

Now you understand: **It's impossible to separate time.**

When you go into the application of time, it's impossible to separate it because **everything that you are doing constantly is past, present, and future. Every second.**

## Time is Only One Thing: Vibration

We have to remember to understand time: **Time is not something that you can divide.**

**Time is only one thing: vibration.**

**The perception of time is according to the frequency of that vibration.**

**It's only one thing that you perceive through the different vibrations it has.**

### Space and Time Are the Same

Once said this, we will recognize that **space and time are basically the same.**

**It's just a vibration with different frequencies.**

**This means everything is referring to itself. It's only one thing.**

**This is "I AM."**

## Future as Inner Transformation

### The Etymology of Future

**Future** comes from the Latin **"Futurus,"** which is a conjugation of the verb "to be" (S.E. - an irregular verb).

The transformation of "to be" in the past is **"FUI"** (that in Spanish we have it also, we use that "fui").

Then we have the suffix **"-turus"** (eclectic **"-uros"**) which is related to a verb of something that is going to happen.

**"FUI-TURNS" means "that one that is going to become."**

### Future is Not a Concept - It's Inner Becoming

**The word future is not talking about a concept in the future.**

**It's talking about the inner transformation of a being.**

**This is why in order to build future, we have to build present.**

**Future is about all the potentialities that you can become.**

### Receiving Information from Future

In between all those potentialities, you can receive the information to become.

**This is why there are so many futures possible. So many parallel realities.**

**Because the future depends on my vibration.**

The reality is that **the future depends precisely on how you vibrate**, because it's the frequency of your vibration.

### Future Can Change

**I can receive information from the future, from the frequency of the future, but that future won't be something that determinates my life.**

**Because whatever I see can change my point of view, transform what I am going to do.**

**So I can change my future in my present.**

## Guided Meditation: The Legacy of Realities

The meditation connects all dimensions and realities through the Sphinx:

1. Focus on breathing, stretch the body to relax
2. Close eyes, concentrate on breathing
3. Find yourself in front of the great Sphinx, the lion - feel its power
4. Thank for all the animals
5. Behind the lion, see the pyramids covered in white, shining
6. Around you, see a lot of people
7. Look at them - recognize they are waiting for you to give them something
8. They wait for the task to begin their path
9. Get closer to the Sphinx between its paws
10. See an altar where you find **12 blue crystals**
11. Take these 12 crystals between your hands
12. Among the people, choose 12 of them (no judging, just see their faces)
13. Give one crystal to each
14. **Here begins a new path for a new humanity**
15. Creating a new reality in the planetary network
16. See the paths of these 12 workers:
    - One going to the Andes and the mountains
    - Another to Siberia with forest and cold
    - Another to Hawaii with volcanoes in the ocean
    - Another in Greenland, feeling the ice
17. See four workers going to warm suns:
    - Brazil in the north
    - Special volcanic islands of Galapagos
    - Lowest island of Micronesia
    - Huge volcano Toba in Sumatra
18. See the last workers arriving:
    - South Africa with its animals
    - South of Australia in Tasmania
    - Islands of Polynesia
    - South of Patagonia in Tierra del Fuego
19. **Recognize these 12 crystals around the world are incarnating the legacy of all the realities of the planet - the diverse sound**
20. Just imagine and feel how these crystals challenge every human to manifest the memory of these workers
21. **I am the legacy of my past. I am the legacy of my future.**
22. Bring hands to heart
23. Feel all these realities in your heart
24. Bring all this consciousness to body here and now

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Ve

**Statement:** I am the legacy of realities

**Code:** Color Black - the sum of all realities, reunion with the void

**Meditation Focus:**
- Understand future as inner becoming, not external destination
- Recognize past/present/future as one vibration with different frequencies
- See yourself as product of future (potentiality) manifesting through present
- Connect with the 12 crystals seeding planetary consciousness
- Remember: you can change your future in your present

**Integration:**
- Today, notice when you think of "the future" as a place ahead of you
- Ask: "What potentiality am I becoming right now?"
- Observe: "How is my vibration determining which future I'm moving toward?"
- Practice: Instead of "I will be," say "I am becoming"
- Remember: The first time was future - you are returning to origin by moving forward
- Recognize: You are the legacy of all realities - past and future exist in you now

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

Every time you catch yourself thinking "In the future, I will..." stop and rephrase: "I am becoming..." Notice how this shifts your energy from waiting to creating. The future is not ahead of you - it's the potentiality becoming actualized through your present vibration.

### Applying This Teaching

When you receive intuitive information about a possible future, remember it's not deterministic - it's showing you one frequency you're vibrating toward. You can change your vibration in the present and thus change which future manifests. Practice asking: "What frequency am I holding right now? Is this creating the future I choose to become?"

## Q&A

### Q: If the first time was the future, how can we "return" to the future by moving forward?

Think of the universe as a breath. The inhale is future (expanding potentiality from the void), the exhale is past (manifesting into form), and the pause is present (awareness). When you reach the present, you start breathing in again - returning to that original state of pure potentiality. Moving "forward" into future is actually moving "back" to the origin. It's a circle, not a line.

### Q: How can everything be past, present, and future simultaneously?

Because time is not three separate things - it's **one vibration perceived at different frequencies**. Like white light contains all colors but we perceive them separately when passed through a prism. Your third-dimensional consciousness is the prism, dividing the one vibration of time into three perceivable aspects. But the division is in your perception, not in reality.

### Q: What does it mean practically that "future depends on how I vibrate"?

Your vibration right now is literally creating your future. Not attracting it, not manifesting it - CREATING it. If you vibrate fear, you create a future where that frequency manifests. If you vibrate love, you create a future where that frequency manifests. The future is not fixed and waiting - it's being generated moment by moment by your present vibration. Change your vibration, change your future.

### Q: If I receive information about the future, why won't it necessarily happen?

Because the information you receive shows you **one potential frequency** - the future you're currently vibrating toward. But you have free will to change your vibration in the present. The moment you receive the information, you might shift your perspective, change your frequency, and thus shift which future actualizes. The future is a field of potentialities, not a fixed destination.

### Q: How can future be "the potentiality of what I can become" if my future involves other people and circumstances?

Remember: you are not separate from other people and circumstances. You are one vibration (I AM) perceiving itself as many. The "future you can become" includes the entire field of relationships and circumstances, because they are all part of the one vibration expressing different frequencies. Your inner transformation (future as becoming) includes and affects the outer field, because inner and outer are one.

### Q: What's the difference between the void at the origin and the present moment?

The void at the origin is pure unmanifest potentiality - nothing has happened yet, everything is possible. The present moment is where potentiality meets actuality - where void becomes form and form returns to void. Present is the meeting point, the pivot, the awareness that holds both past (manifested form) and future (potentiality) in one instant. This is why present moment is so powerful - it's where you touch the void.

### Q: How do the 12 blue crystals relate to the teaching about future?

The 12 crystals represent the seeding of new realities across the planetary grid - they are potentialities being planted now that will manifest in the future. They demonstrate that future is not predetermined - it's being co-created through conscious action in the present. Each crystal is a frequency, a possibility, a future reality being anchored. You are part of this network, carrying the legacy of realities within you.

### Q: Why did Matias keep his personal future message private?

Because true wisdom about your own future must be processed, integrated, and accepted within before it can be shared outward. Information from the future is not meant to create expectations or dependencies - it's meant to guide your present becoming. By keeping it private, he honors the sacred nature of inner transformation and avoids others projecting onto his path. Your future is between you and the void.

**Reflection:** After an eclipse death in the sarcophagus, wet with tears, we emerge with a radical understanding: time is not a river flowing from past to future, but a vibration pulsing from void to form and back again. We learn that the first time was not past (what has been) but future (what is about to be), because in the beginning there was only infinite potentiality waiting to exist. We discover that our perception of three times is just our third-dimensional consciousness dividing the indivisible one, like a prism splitting white light into rainbow. And we remember the liberating truth: future is not a destination racing toward us or away from us - it is the inner transformation we are becoming right now, frequency by frequency, vibration by vibration. The 12 blue crystals being seeded across the planet remind us that we are not passive recipients of a predetermined future but active co-creators of new realities, consciously choosing which frequencies to embody, which potentialities to actualize. We are the legacy of all realities - past and future converge in our present awareness, void and form dance in our throats, and every word we speak is both echo of origin and seed of what we are becoming. This is the power of understanding time: not to predict it or control it, but to recognize that we ARE it, vibrating, pulsing, eternally becoming what we have always potentially been.
