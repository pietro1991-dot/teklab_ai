# Day 87 - Sociality and Sexuality

## Overview

Today connects with root chakra in Libra Physical Week, exploring sexuality and sensuality. Root chakra represents structure of who I am—basis of structure that gives stability.

Sexuality is something we don't talk much in society because there's lot of fear around sexuality—fear created by culture, religion, education we've received. But sexuality and sensuality are quite not same thing we believe they are.

When we understand sexuality, we have to go to true essence of what word means. When we understand sensuality, we have to understand what each concept means. Most people confuse sexuality with sensuality. What we call "sexual" and "sensual" are different things.

What I want to teach today is fundamental structure we have as humans, animals, organisms in general—we have to understand why we're structured like this, to understand better why we feel like we do, why we're diverse as we are.

## Core Teaching

### Sex: The Act of Separating

Sex comes from Latin word secare—meaning to separate, cut, divide. Related with concept of separation. When you're at root chakra, you're separate from whole. Root chakra is place where you're cut from cord of your mother. That's sex.

Sex is process where you separate something in two, three, four, ten parts. Sex is simply act of separation.

When we understand word sex like that, we understand sex is not only what we call genital expression, but sex is everything that separates me from others. Sex is everything making us different from each other.

Sex is word we use when we want to express that our structure divided, separated from something else.

### Gender: Only Two Biological Options

Gender related with word "to generate." Gender goes to genitals. Comes from same origin: genital, generate, gender.

Gender is only biological thing you find when you separate (when you sex). There are only two genders: male and female. That's it. Nothing else. And it's only biological.

When you separate (when you sex), you find two types of biology that have only one purpose—to join again in completely different, new structure. That's why you find two genders.

But we confuse concept of gender and sex, that are only biology, with sensuality and sexuality—that are completely different.

### Sensuality: Diversity Through Feeling

Sensuality comes from Latin census—to feel, perceive. Related with concept of senses. When you feel, when you perceive, you start creating sense of things—give meaning to things.

Sensuality is about how I am able to perceive world, how I am able to feel things through my five senses. Sensuality is related with all perception.

Sensuality is related with diversity. This means there are not two types of sensuality—there are millions of types of sensuality, ways of perceiving, feeling.

Sensuality is subjective. Sensuality is way I feel things. Gender and sex are objective—biology, structure. Sensuality is completely subjective—millions of ways I can perceive, feel.

This is why when we confuse sensuality with sexuality or gender, we limit our capacity to feel, to perceive. Diversity of sensuality is what gives me diversity.

### Sexuality: Tool for Sensuality

Sexuality is related with how I use my genital structure, my biological gender, to express sensuality—to express how I feel.

Sexuality is just tool I use to give sensuality form. Sexuality is just one of ways to express sensuality. But sensuality itself has millions of ways to be expressed—not only through genital structure.

When we confuse sensuality with sexuality, we limit ourselves to believe only way to feel is through sexual expression. But sensuality expresses through all five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing.

Sexuality is just tiny part of sensuality—one tool among many tools to perceive and express how I feel.

### Spirit Experiencing Through Senses

Why we're structured like this? Why we're here?

Spirit is something that doesn't have matter. Spirit has consciousness, awareness, but doesn't have structure. Spirit came to creation, to matter, to experience through structure.

Spirit came to creation to perceive, to feel. Spirit wants to experience through five senses what it cannot experience in spiritual realms.

This is why we're here: to feel, to perceive through senses. Your job as spirit in matter is to feel as much as you can—to experience diversity of perception.

When you limit your sensuality to only sexuality, you're limiting whole experience your spirit came here for. You're reducing enormous perception capacity to tiny genital expression.

### Ancient Erotic Cultures: No Segregation

In ancient times, there were cultures we call erotic cultures. Erotic comes from Eros—Greek god representing love, union.

Erotic cultures were societies where people understood sexuality and sensuality differently than we do today. They understood all ways to express sensuality were valid—not only genital expression.

In erotic cultures, there was no segregation based on gender, sex, or how you express sensuality. All expressions were part of same thing: spirit experiencing creation through senses.

There was no segregation between men and women. There was no segregation between different ways to feel. Everything was integrated—understanding diversity as natural state.

### Monotheistic Religions Created Segregation

When monotheistic religions appeared (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), they brought concept of rigid structure, control, order based on fear.

Monotheistic religions created segregation between genders. They separated men from women, giving power to one over other. They created fear around sexuality, sensuality.

They limited diversity of sensuality to only one way: heterosexual marriage for reproduction. Everything else became sin, wrong, bad.

This segregation, fear, control—this is not natural. This was created by culture, religion, education over last 2,000-3,000 years.

Before that, in ancient erotic cultures, there was no such segregation. Diversity was natural. All ways to feel, perceive, express sensuality were valid parts of spirit experiencing creation.

## Integration

**Daily:** Notice how you perceive through all five senses—not just genital sexuality. Taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing. Expand sensuality beyond sexuality.

**Weekly:** Root chakra practice, massage genitals without shame. This is your structure. Spirit chose it to experience creation through matter.

**Monthly:** Identify one area where you limit sensuality to sexuality. How can you expand perception beyond genital expression?

**Ongoing:** Remember: ancient erotic cultures had no segregation. Diversity is natural. All ways to feel, perceive, express sensuality are valid parts of spirit experiencing creation.

## Questions and Answers

**Q: If gender is only biological (two options), what about gender identity?**
A: Gender identity is not gender—it's sensuality. How you feel, perceive yourself is sensuality (subjective, millions of ways). Biology (gender) is objective, two options. Don't confuse structure with perception.

**Q: Does this mean all sexual expressions are valid?**
A: All consensual expressions of sensuality are valid. Your job is to feel, perceive as much as you can. As long as you respect others' autonomy, all ways to express sensuality (including sexuality) are part of spirit experiencing creation.

**Q: Why did monotheistic religions create segregation?**
A: Control. When you segregate, create fear around natural things (sexuality, sensuality), you control people. Fear makes people obey. Ancient cultures understood diversity as natural—no control needed.

**Q: How do I overcome shame around sexuality?**
A: Understand: shame is cultural programming from last 2,000-3,000 years. Before that, no shame. Your body is tool for spirit to experience creation. Touch it, honor it, know it. Shame serves control, not truth.

**Q: If spirit came to feel, why is there pain?**
A: Spirit came to experience all perception—pleasure, pain, everything. Full range of sensuality. Pain teaches too. You're here to feel as much as you can, not avoid feeling.

**Q: What about asexual people who don't feel sexual attraction?**
A: Perfect example! Sexuality (genital expression) is just one tool for sensuality. Asexual people experience sensuality through other senses. Diversity is millions of ways to feel—not all include sexuality.

**Q: How can I practice ancient erotic culture in modern world?**
A: Internally: remove segregation in your mind. All expressions of sensuality valid. Externally: respect all ways people feel, perceive. Create space without judgment for diversity.

**Q: If there are only two genders biologically, how do I honor people who identify differently?**
A: Honor their sensuality—how they feel, perceive themselves. Gender (biology) and sensuality (perception) are different. You can honor both: biological reality and subjective experience.

## Closing Reflection

Today's teaching separates confusion: sex (separation), gender (biology—two options), sensuality (perception—millions of options), sexuality (tool for sensuality). What culture taught you to fear, control, segregate is not truth. It's programming from last 2,000-3,000 years.

Before monotheistic religions created segregation, ancient erotic cultures (Eros=love, union) understood: all ways to feel, perceive, express sensuality are valid. No sin, no wrong, no bad. Just spirit experiencing creation through senses.

Your root chakra holds your biological structure—gift your spirit chose to experience matter. All your ancestors brought you here through sexual reproduction. Honor that. But don't reduce enormous perception capacity to tiny genital expression.

Spirit came to creation to feel through five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing. Sexuality is just one tool among many. When you expand sensuality beyond sexuality, you fulfill why you're here—to perceive as much as you can, experience diversity.

Diversity lives in sensuality, not sexuality. Millions of ways to feel, perceive. Your job: remove segregation in your mind. All expressions valid. Ancient cultures knew this. Modern culture forgot. Now you remember.

You are fruit of all evolution when you honor structure you have (gender, sex), expand perception beyond limits (sensuality), use tools without shame (sexuality), and recognize: you're spirit experiencing creation through senses. That's why you're here. That's the teaching.
