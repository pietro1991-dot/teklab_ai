## Overview

Today we explore the fundamental difference between wisdom and knowledge, understanding how they flow in opposite directions. Wisdom relates to the throat chakra through the concept of taste - the ability to discern and integrate what comes from outside. We learn how the universe divided wisdom into knowledge so we could experience free will and creativity.

## Wisdom and the Throat Chakra

We relate wisdom with the throat chakra because, even though in English "wisdom" connects to "wise" (bringing the body), **in Latin, wisdom comes from "sapere"** - which means **the flavors of things**, the taste.

Once you inherit things, you have to **taste them** to perceive them. When you taste them, you know if they are good or bad. **Wisdom is the way our body interprets what is outside to integrate within.**

The sense of **taste** is the same as wisdom - it's about discernment, about knowing what to take in and what to reject. This is why wisdom connects to the throat chakra - the place where we taste, swallow, and express.

## Knowledge vs. Wisdom: Opposite Flows

### Knowledge - From Outside to Inside

**Knowledge** comes from Latin "cognoscere" - "co-gnoscere":
- **"Co"** = to put all things together
- **"Gnoscere"** = to join them

Knowledge is something **in the outside that you bring within**. You take from the external world and bring it inside yourself. Knowledge flows **from positive (outside) to negative (inside)**.

### Wisdom - From Inside to Outside

**Wisdom** is when you **take something from within and express it outside**. It is the opposite flow. Wisdom is **negative (inside) expressing into positive (outside)**.

### The Two Aspects

- **Knowledge** = expressed in the world outside (positive)
- **Wisdom** = in the world within (negative)

## The Origin of Wisdom in the Universe

### The Universe as Wise Being

The universe begins as a blank, a patient blank where everything is connected, where everything is one. There are no things to compare. The consciousness of the universe can see and perceive everything within.

**The universe, by nature, is the wise being - it IS wisdom.** It has wisdom of everything. This universe, this being with awareness and consciousness, knows everything, so it has wisdom upon everything. 

**But it never experienced anything.**

### The Need for Experience

The universe has wisdom but needs a **point of reference** to understand what it knows. The wisdom it has within needs experience to have meaning.

So the universe divides itself to create **another point of reference** - the other one in the outside. From the void of consciousness, it creates the positive (the whole, the everything).

Now we have:
- **Negative and positive**
- **Void and whole**
- **Consciousness and unconscious**

The **unconscious** is the movement of consciousness pushed by the other one. The movement depends on the interaction of opposites.

### Creating the Subconscious

As positive and negative move forward toward each other, they create a **network**, a pendulum, different paths and ways to connect. This creates the whole network or matrix of thoughts - the **memories of the universe**, also called the **subconscious**.

Picture the universe as blank paper:
- The paper is the **whole** (it's all you have)
- But it's also **blank** (nothing is there)
- This is why the universe is both **void and whole** simultaneously

When the unconscious begins, we bend this blank paper, facing two options - creating the **duality of void and whole**. We project positive and negative.

As we keep bending, creating more and more shapes, we create the **wrinkles** that form the **subconscious**.

### Wisdom Creates Questions

The divine is like **light that sees everywhere**. But when the subconscious started to bend and have wrinkles, we created **shadows**. Those shadows create:
- **Questions**
- **Doubts**  
- **Conflicts** that the divine faces

**Why would a being with all wisdom create conflicts?**

Simple - a wise being knows that **answers are not the whole thing**. Answers are just answers. **The real wisdom is awakening through discovery, being amazed by things.**

The wise universe says: **"I can maybe do better. I can do it differently."**

## Knowledge: Wisdom Divided

To find better ways to do things, the wise being takes wisdom and **divides it into tiny little pieces all around the universe**. That's what we call **knowledge**.

**Knowledge is wisdom spread in tiny pieces all around the universe.**

By separating wisdom into knowledge particles, the universe opens the game so we can become unique, so we can discover how to use the tools creatively.

### The Universe as a Game

The universe has **laws** - the basic seven laws we all know. These are like **rules of the game**. 

Consider football or music:
- The **rules are the same** for everyone
- But some people **make a difference** because of their gifts and strategy
- They can improve the game even while respecting the rules
- They use the same tools **differently**

In music, there are **twelve notes** (the laws of this universe):
- These twelve notes are available to everyone
- You can use them anywhere, anytime, however you want
- You can create instruments to play them
- You can be original in making music

**The universe is about being creative** - knowing what you're capable of with the tools you have.

### Awakening the Wisdom Within

**How can I find this wisdom?**

The wisdom we all have is a **tiny particle** within each being in the universe - the ability to be original, to awaken potential. This is our **uniqueness**, our **gift**.

This is the knowledge we have within that we share outside - this is our potentially, our own contribution.

**How do I awaken the wisdom within?**

If wisdom is within (negative), I can only take it out through its polarity - the **positive** (outside). What I look for is **energy outside** - and that's why we call it **knowledge**.

Every book you read, every movie, every course, every education, everything you learn, everything you look for outside to learn is the **positive** that you take within to **awaken the potential of your wisdom by magnetism**.

## The Exchange of Wisdom and Knowledge

Right now, in this teaching:
- **I am giving wisdom** (it's inside me, I express it out)
- **For you, it is knowledge** (you take it from outside in)

You take this as knowledge, not as wisdom. I share my wisdom, and you receive knowledge. 

**But you also have wisdom within.** If you share your wisdom, I receive it as knowledge, so I can learn too.

**This is education** - the exchange and flow between wisdom and knowledge.

### Nobody Has All Wisdom

There is **no person who is wise in all things** - not even the universe itself, not even God.

Wisdom is recognizing and understanding that:
- **You have something to give** (your unique wisdom)
- **Others have something to give too** (their unique wisdom)
- **We all are part of wisdom** from the origin of the universe

When we share knowledge, **we improve our wisdom**. This is the process of sharing and learning.

### Example of Limitations

For example, if you asked me to do math (like 5 + 7), my brain just stops. There is **no particle of wisdom in numbers** in my head. Nothing, not even myself can do basic math.

**We all have something to learn.** Each person has areas where they carry wisdom particles and areas where they need to receive knowledge.

## The Octahedron Geometry

The **octahedron** is formed inside the cube, from the conjunction of both tetrahedrons. It originates the small octahedron - the **seed of the Tree of Life**.

According to Atlantean tradition, this represents the **ether** - the essence that originates everything in the cosmos, holding the divine potential of creation.

- **12 edges** = the paths of creation
- **8 faces** = the dimensions of time and space
- **6 vertices** = the attributes and gifts

The octahedron complements the vision of the cube, showing the basis of the universe related to **space (12), time (8), and attributes/gifts (6)**.

## Guided Meditation: Absorbing Knowledge to Awaken Wisdom

The meditation takes us through the journey of growth and learning:

1. Begin as a seed beneath the mud, absorbing nutrients
2. Extend roots deep (taking in) and leaves up (reaching out)
3. Grow through the Tree of Life toward the light
4. Flower above the forest, seeing the vast world
5. Rise to see oceans, continents, the entire planet
6. Reach space and see Earth shining with light
7. Circle the planet, seeing all lands
8. Recognize Earth as your reality, your body
9. Find all knowledge in this world waiting for you
10. Acknowledge the world waits for your wisdom too

**Bring the world to your throat** - taking all its knowledge and awakening the wisdom within you.

## Daily Practice

**Vibration:** Yeh

**Statement:** I am reality's dimension (I am the dimension of reality)

**Code:** The Octahedron - seed of the Tree of Life, representing ether, the divine potential of creation

**Meditation Focus:**
- Recognize the flow: knowledge comes in, wisdom goes out
- Practice receiving knowledge from the world with gratitude
- Practice sharing your wisdom without attachment
- Understand that learning and teaching are two sides of one flow
- Bring Earth's knowledge to your throat chakra
- Allow wisdom to awaken and express

**Nightly Practice:**
When you go to sleep, set the intention to **awaken your own wisdom**. Take all the knowledge you absorbed during the day and let it settle into wisdom overnight.

**Reflection:** Wisdom and knowledge are not separate - they are opposite flows of the same essence. Knowledge enters from outside to nourish the wisdom seed within. Wisdom grows from inside to be shared outside. We are all both students and teachers, receivers and givers. The universe divided its wisdom into countless knowledge particles so we could experience the joy of discovery, the amazement of learning, and the creativity of free will. Our task is not to hoard knowledge but to receive it graciously, let it awaken our inner wisdom, and share that wisdom freely with others. In this sacred exchange, we all grow together toward the collective awakening of universal wisdom.
