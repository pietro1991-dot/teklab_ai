## Overview

Today we explore **independence**—one of the most celebrated yet misunderstood concepts in human culture.

We celebrate independence days. We encourage people to "be independent." We honor those who break free.

**But we rarely examine what independence actually means, or why it's so hard to achieve.**

This teaching connects **personal independence** with **national independence** and reveals the **paradox**: we can never be fully independent, yet the pursuit of independence is essential.

---

## Etymology of Independence

### Breaking Down the Word

**Independence** has four components:

1. **In** = from particle "nec" = no, without, not
2. **De** = from up to below (something above coming down)
3. **Pend** = to hang from someplace
4. **Ence** = concept

**Independence means: the concept of NOT hanging from something that is above.**

### Dependence vs. Independence

**Dependence**: Someone or something **hanging below** something or **hanging from** something that is above.

**Independence**: **Not** hanging from above. Not relying on something external for support.

## Independence Related to Knees: History and Ancestors

### Why Knees Represent History

The **knees chakra** represents:
- **History** (personal and collective)
- **Ancestors** (lineage, family tree)
- **The path walked** (steps taken through time)

When we talk about independence in relation to the knees, we're talking about:

**Independence from the past, from ancestors, from the history that shaped us.**

### The Big Picture: Nations

The most visible example of independence is **national independence**:

A country wants to be independent because:
- Another country took power over their **territory**
- Another country dominated their **culture**
- They want **freedom of choice**, **self-government**

They **fight back** to:
- Push away the empire/crown
- Gain back their power
- **Not hang from** the power of others
- Be their **own source** instead of a part hanging from a main source

**Independence = Taking back the power of self-government.**

---

## The Paradox of Independence

### Nations Within Nations

Here's where it gets complicated:

Once a country gains independence, what often happens inside?

The new country has:
- Different regions
- Different cultures
- Different languages
- Different ideas

Some of these regions want **their own independence** from the new government.

**But the new government denies it.**

### The Repetition

The same pattern repeats:
1. Region A fights for independence from Empire B
2. Region A wins, becomes Nation A
3. Region C (inside Nation A) wants independence from Nation A
4. Nation A says no

**The same oppression, just a smaller scale.**

### From Nations to Families to Individuals

This pattern continues down through levels:
- Nations deny regions' independence
- Regions deny cities' independence
- Cities deny communities' independence
- **Families deny individuals' independence**

Until we arrive at **one individual** who wants to separate, to do something different, something new.

**But the others don't accept their freedom because they don't understand what they want to do.**

---

## Why Does This Happen?

### The Question

"Why is some independence good and some independence not?"

Examples throughout history:
- **1776**: United States gains independence from Britain
  - **Then**: States fight each other (Civil War)
  - North forces South to stay united
- **Brazil**: Part wants to stay with Portugal, part wants Republic
  - Republicans **force** the others to join the new republic
- **Scotland, Catalonia** (modern day): Want independence
  - Denied by larger nations

### Nationalism: The Illusion of Protection

**Nationalism** was created to:
- Make people believe they **belong to a territory**
- Make people believe they're part of a **group that protects them**
- Keep the **government in power**

The government creates the idea:
- "Everyone outside is an enemy"
- "All enemies must be pushed out"
- "This territory is yours, you belong here"
- "We will protect you if you stay loyal"

**This is brainwashing to maintain governmental power.**

### The Purpose of Nations: A Bigger Family

Nations exist to create **a bigger family**—an extended protection system.

But in the age of:
- **Networks**
- **Globalization**
- **Constant exchange**

...nationalism **doesn't make sense anymore**.

Why should one capital control many territories that think differently?

**In a networked world, why hold territories by force?**

---

## Individual Independence: The Core Issue

### The Real Independence

The reason nations exist is because we wanted to make a bigger family.

But **we lost our own individual independence** in the process.

**The real question isn't national independence.**

**The real question is: Can I be independent as an individual?**

### What Individual Independence Means

**Independence is conscious choice of dependence.**

Let me explain:

- You will **always** depend on something (food, water, air, community)
- The question is: **Do you consciously choose what you depend on?**

**Dependence by default** = Slavery, unconsciousness

**Dependence by choice** = Independence, freedom

### The Paradox Resolved

You can never be **fully** independent (you need air, water, food, others).

But you can be independent in the **choice** of what you depend on.

**Independence = The freedom to choose your dependencies.**

## The Three Levels of Consciousness

### Subconscious Dependencies

Things you **cannot control**:
- Breathing
- Eating
- Sleeping
- Biological functions

These are **given** by your biology, your genealogical tree.

You depend on your **physical/biological history**.

### Unconscious Dependencies

Things controlled by **emotions and attachments**:
- Fear
- Attachments to people/places/things
- Emotional bonds from your family/ancestors
- Traumatic patterns

These come from your **emotional history** and **genealogical emotional tree**.

You don't realize you're dependent because emotions are **unconscious**.

### Conscious Dependencies

Things you **think about and choose**:
- Beliefs
- Values
- Worldviews
- Decisions based on what you've been taught

**To be conscious ≠ to be enlightened.**

**To be conscious = to think and determine your reality based on what you believe.**

Example: A religious person who says "You will go to hell for sinning" is **conscious**—they know what they believe and apply it.

Consciousness can be **wise or unwise**. The point is: it's **aware and chosen**.

## Applied Wisdom: Making Independence Real

### "I Am Applied Wisdom"

The statement for today is: **"I Am Applied Wisdom."**

**Applied wisdom** means:
- Not just understanding independence conceptually
- **Living it**
- Making **conscious choices** about dependencies
- Acting from freedom, not unconscious attachment

### The Practice

In each chakra, examine:

**"In which of my [beliefs/thoughts/feelings/etc.] am I dependent, and in which sense independent?"**

This reveals:
- Where you're **unconsciously hanging from** the past
- Where you've **consciously chosen** what to rely on
- Where you need to **shift from default dependence to chosen independence**

---

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Become aware of breath, body, and space.

### Knees Activation

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark.

Bring this light to your **knees**.

### Crown - Beliefs

**"In which of my beliefs am I dependent? In which am I independent?"**

Are your beliefs chosen consciously, or inherited unconsciously?

### Third Eye - Thoughts

**"In which of my thoughts am I dependent? In which am I independent?"**

Do you think for yourself, or repeat what you were taught?

### Throat - Truth

**"In which of my truths am I dependent? In which am I independent?"**

Can you speak your truth, or must you conform to others' truths?

### Heart - Feelings

**"In which of my feelings am I dependent? In which am I independent?"**

Are your emotions your own, or absorbed from family/culture?

### Solar Plexus - Being

**"In which aspects of who I am am I dependent? In which am I independent?"**

Is your identity self-chosen, or imposed by others?

### Sacral - Creation

**"In which of my creations am I dependent? In which am I independent?"**

Do you create what you want, or what's expected?

### Root - Reality

**"In which aspects of my reality am I dependent? In which am I independent?"**

What parts of your life are chosen vs. inherited?

### Knees - Ancestors

**"From which ancestors am I dependent? From which have I become independent?"**

What patterns have you broken? What patterns still control you?

### Ankles - Purpose

**"In my purpose, where am I dependent? Where am I independent?"**

Is your mission yours, or someone else's expectation?

### Sound Practice

Sound: **Ru**

**I am applied wisdom. I am applied wisdom. I am applied wisdom.**

**I am. I am. I am.**

### Integration

Recognize: You will always depend on something.

**The question is: Do you consciously choose what you depend on?**

**That choice = Independence.**

### Closing

Breathe. Stretch. Yawn. Return to here and now.

- In a networked, globalized world, nationalism (one capital controlling diverse territories) doesn't make sense.
- The real question isn't national independence but individual independence.
- Independence ≠ no dependencies (impossible); Independence = conscious choice of dependencies.
- Three levels: Subconscious (biological needs), Unconscious (emotional attachments), Conscious (chosen beliefs/values).

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Notice today: **What am I depending on unconsciously?**

Then ask: **"If I were to choose consciously, would I still choose this dependency?"**

If yes: You're independent (choosing your dependence).

If no: You have work to do (becoming aware and choosing differently).

### The Nationalism Check

When you feel nationalistic pride or "us vs. them" thinking:

Ask: "Is this **true protection** or **manufactured tribalism** to keep a government in power?"

In a networked world, we don't need fortified borders as much as we need **conscious cooperation**.

### Individual Independence Practice

Choose one area where you're dependent by default (family expectations, cultural norms, inherited beliefs).

This week: **Consciously examine** it.

Ask: "Do I choose this? Or am I just hanging from it unconsciously?"

Then: **Decide** consciously whether to keep it or let it go.

**That decision = Independence**, regardless of the outcome.

## Q&A

### Q: Can I ever be truly independent?

No, if you mean "depending on nothing." Yes, if you mean "consciously choosing what you depend on." True independence is **conscious dependence**.

### Q: Why do nations that fought for independence deny it to others?

Because they confuse **self-government** with **holding power over territory**. They want independence for themselves but power over others—the same oppression, different scale.

### Q: Is nationalism always bad?

Nationalism served a purpose (uniting diverse people for protection). But in a networked, globalized age, it often becomes **tribalism** that divides rather than authentic cultural identity that enriches.

### Q: How do I know if I'm independent or just rebellious?

Rebellion = reactive, unconscious "no" to authority. Independence = conscious choice of what you depend on. Ask: "Am I reacting against something, or choosing toward something?"

### Q: What if my family/culture won't accept my independence?

Their acceptance isn't required. Independence is **your conscious choice**, not their permission. But recognize: you may need to create healthy boundaries.

### Q: How can I be independent if I need money, food, shelter?

Independence ≠ hermit life. It means: Do you **consciously choose** how you earn money? What food you eat? Where you live? Or are these unconscious defaults from family/society?

### Q: What's the relationship between yesterday's "Fury" and today's "Independence"?

Fury arises when you're **forced to depend** on something against your will. Independence is **choosing** your dependencies. When you can't choose, fury boils.
