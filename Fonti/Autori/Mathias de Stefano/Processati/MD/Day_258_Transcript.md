## Overview

Today we explore **independence**—one of the most celebrated yet misunderstood concepts in human culture.

We celebrate independence days. We encourage people to "be independent." We honor those who break free.

**But we rarely examine what independence actually means, or why it's so hard to achieve.**

This teaching connects **personal independence** with **national independence** and reveals the **paradox**: we can never be fully independent, yet the pursuit of independence is essential.

## Core Teaching

### Etymology of Independence

Independence has four components:

1. In = from particle "nec" = no, without, not
2. De = from up to below (something above coming down)
3. Pend = to hang from someplace
4. Ence = concept

Independence means: the concept of NOT hanging from something that is above.

Dependence: Someone or something hanging below something or hanging from something that is above.

Independence: Not hanging from above. Not relying on something external for support.

### Independence Related to Knees: History and Ancestors

The knees chakra represents history (personal and collective), ancestors (lineage, family tree), and the path walked (steps taken through time).

When we talk about independence in relation to the knees, we're talking about independence from the past, from ancestors, from the history that shaped us.

### The Big Picture: Nations

The most visible example of independence is national independence.

A country wants to be independent because another country took power over their territory, dominated their culture, and they want freedom of choice and self-government.

They fight back to push away the empire/crown, gain back their power, not hang from the power of others, and be their own source instead of a part hanging from a main source.

Independence equals taking back the power of self-government.

### The Paradox of Independence

Once a country gains independence, what often happens inside?

The new country has different regions, cultures, languages, and ideas. Some of these regions want their own independence from the new government. But the new government denies it.

The same pattern repeats: Region A fights for independence from Empire B. Region A wins, becomes Nation A. Region C (inside Nation A) wants independence from Nation A. Nation A says no.

The same oppression, just a smaller scale.

### From Nations to Families to Individuals

This pattern continues down through levels: Nations deny regions' independence, regions deny cities' independence, cities deny communities' independence, families deny individuals' independence.

Until we arrive at one individual who wants to separate, to do something different, something new. But the others don't accept their freedom because they don't understand what they want to do.

### Why Does This Happen?

"Why is some independence good and some independence not?"

Examples throughout history: 1776 United States gains independence from Britain, then states fight each other (Civil War) and North forces South to stay united. Brazil: Part wants to stay with Portugal, part wants Republic—Republicans force the others to join the new republic. Scotland, Catalonia (modern day) want independence but are denied by larger nations.

### Nationalism: The Illusion of Protection

Nationalism was created to make people believe they belong to a territory, make people believe they're part of a group that protects them, and keep the government in power.

The government creates the idea: "Everyone outside is an enemy," "All enemies must be pushed out," "This territory is yours, you belong here," "We will protect you if you stay loyal."

This is brainwashing to maintain governmental power.

### The Purpose of Nations: A Bigger Family

Nations exist to create a bigger family—an extended protection system.

But in the age of networks, globalization, and constant exchange, nationalism doesn't make sense anymore.

Why should one capital control many territories that think differently? In a networked world, why hold territories by force?

### Individual Independence: The Core Issue

The reason nations exist is because we wanted to make a bigger family. But we lost our own individual independence in the process.

The real question isn't national independence. The real question is: Can I be independent as an individual?

### What Individual Independence Means

Independence is conscious choice of dependence.

You will always depend on something (food, water, air, community). The question is: Do you consciously choose what you depend on?

Dependence by default equals slavery, unconsciousness. Dependence by choice equals independence, freedom.

You can never be fully independent (you need air, water, food, others). But you can be independent in the choice of what you depend on.

Independence equals the freedom to choose your dependencies.

### The Three Levels of Consciousness

Subconscious Dependencies: Things you cannot control—breathing, eating, sleeping, biological functions. These are given by your biology, your genealogical tree. You depend on your physical/biological history.

Unconscious Dependencies: Things controlled by emotions and attachments—fear, attachments to people/places/things, emotional bonds from your family/ancestors, traumatic patterns. These come from your emotional history and genealogical emotional tree. You don't realize you're dependent because emotions are unconscious.

Conscious Dependencies: Things you think about and choose—beliefs, values, worldviews, decisions based on what you've been taught. To be conscious does not equal to be enlightened. To be conscious equals to think and determine your reality based on what you believe. Example: A religious person who says "You will go to hell for sinning" is conscious—they know what they believe and apply it. Consciousness can be wise or unwise. The point is: it's aware and chosen.

### Applied Wisdom: Making Independence Real

The statement for today is: "I Am Applied Wisdom."

Applied wisdom means not just understanding independence conceptually, but living it, making conscious choices about dependencies, and acting from freedom, not unconscious attachment.

In each chakra, examine: "In which of my [beliefs/thoughts/feelings/etc.] am I dependent, and in which sense independent?"

This reveals where you're unconsciously hanging from the past, where you've consciously chosen what to rely on, and where you need to shift from default dependence to chosen independence.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Become aware of breath, body, and space.

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark. Bring this light to your knees.

### Main Practice

Crown - Beliefs: "In which of my beliefs am I dependent? In which am I independent?" Are your beliefs chosen consciously, or inherited unconsciously?

Third Eye - Thoughts: "In which of my thoughts am I dependent? In which am I independent?" Do you think for yourself, or repeat what you were taught?

Throat - Truth: "In which of my truths am I dependent? In which am I independent?" Can you speak your truth, or must you conform to others' truths?

Heart - Feelings: "In which of my feelings am I dependent? In which am I independent?" Are your emotions your own, or absorbed from family/culture?

Solar Plexus - Being: "In which aspects of who I am am I dependent? In which am I independent?" Is your identity self-chosen, or imposed by others?

Sacral - Creation: "In which of my creations am I dependent? In which am I independent?" Do you create what you want, or what's expected?

Root - Reality: "In which aspects of my reality am I dependent? In which am I independent?" What parts of your life are chosen vs. inherited?

Knees - Ancestors: "From which ancestors am I dependent? From which have I become independent?" What patterns have you broken? What patterns still control you?

Ankles - Purpose: "In my purpose, where am I dependent? Where am I independent?" Is your mission yours, or someone else's expectation?

Sound: Ru

I am applied wisdom. I am applied wisdom. I am applied wisdom.

I am. I am. I am.

### Closing

Recognize: You will always depend on something. The question is: Do you consciously choose what you depend on?

That choice equals independence.

Breathe. Stretch. Yawn. Return to here and now.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Notice today: What am I depending on unconsciously?

Then ask: **"If I were to choose consciously, would I still choose this dependency?"**

If yes: You're independent (choosing your dependence).

If no: You have work to do (becoming aware and choosing differently).

### The Nationalism Check

When you feel nationalistic pride or "us vs. them" thinking:

Ask: "Is this **true protection** or **manufactured tribalism** to keep a government in power?"

In a networked world, we don't need fortified borders as much as we need **conscious cooperation**.

### Individual Independence Practice

Choose one area where you're dependent by default (family expectations, cultural norms, inherited beliefs).

This week: **Consciously examine** it.

Ask: "Do I choose this? Or am I just hanging from it unconsciously?"

Then: **Decide** consciously whether to keep it or let it go.

**That decision = Independence**, regardless of the outcome.

## Q&A

### Q: Can I ever be truly independent?

No, if you mean "depending on nothing." Yes, if you mean "consciously choosing what you depend on." True independence is **conscious dependence**.

### Q: Why do nations that fought for independence deny it to others?

Because they confuse **self-government** with **holding power over territory**. They want independence for themselves but power over others—the same oppression, different scale.

### Q: Is nationalism always bad?

Nationalism served a purpose (uniting diverse people for protection). But in a networked, globalized age, it often becomes **tribalism** that divides rather than authentic cultural identity that enriches.

### Q: How do I know if I'm independent or just rebellious?

Rebellion = reactive, unconscious "no" to authority. Independence = conscious choice of what you depend on. Ask: "Am I reacting against something, or choosing toward something?"

### Q: What if my family/culture won't accept my independence?

Their acceptance isn't required. Independence is **your conscious choice**, not their permission. But recognize: you may need to create healthy boundaries.

### Q: How can I be independent if I need money, food, shelter?

Independence ≠ hermit life. It means: Do you **consciously choose** how you earn money? What food you eat? Where you live? Or are these unconscious defaults from family/society?

### Q: What's the relationship between yesterday's "Fury" and today's "Independence"?

Fury arises when you're **forced to depend** on something against your will. Independence is **choosing** your dependencies. When you can't choose, fury boils.
