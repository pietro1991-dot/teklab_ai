## Introduction

Hi , I 'm good morning , good afternoon , good evening. I hope you 're okay.

Today here in Cairo , I looked like tired because today it was like 45 , 46 degrees Census here and I 'm just aside to this here.

## Guided Meditation

So it was impossible even to breathe outside. A lot of hot and the hot led me a bit down.

So let 's begin today with the day of our knees in the emotional week of the month of areas. The topic for today is in dependence.

Okay.

So first of all , remember what is in dependence. In dependence has 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 different words in one. In comes from the particle neck that means no without that is not. Then the particle day that means from up below.

So something that is above coming down. Then , then that means to hang from someplace. And then , yeah , that means concept.

So in dependence , which in English could be an E here , E , I , A. It becomes an E in English means the concept.

So is the concept of something that is hanging from something that is above. That would be.

So dependence means something or someone that is hanging below something below something or is hanging from something that is above. And in dependence means that is not hanging from above.

Okay.

So let 's remember that we are going to speak about independence related to our knees. This means that the concept of independence will be spoken according to what our knees means , which is the story or history. Our own history.

So of course that when we speak about independence related to our knees , is connected to the idea of our ancestors of the links that we have with our experiences throughout our own life. And then , says his life. Of course that the concept of independence in our head related with the history of the freedom of the countries , and also related to that person that decides to live alone besides the other ones. Besides the reliance that this person has with other people.

So of course that for us in our culture , we hear a lot the terms independence or an independent person , a lot , as something really good and we encourage people to be independent. Because we hear this word when we celebrate the country.

So we are celebrating this concept of being independent of someone from someone. Or we celebrate and encourage people to have their own life , to decide their own decisions and so on.

So we kind of honor the concept of independence in most of the countries. But even though we do n't really know exactly how to live being independent , because we have many struggles trying to be independent.

So let 's go from the big picture and then we go to the small one.

So speaking of the big picture , let 's say about , let 's talk about the independence of the countries.

The reason why a country wants to be independent is mostly because some other country to power over the territory or over the culture of one place. And they started to fight back to try to gain back the freedom of choice.

## Energy Work

So they just push back the crown or the empire that we 're taking power.

So they could gain the power back.

So gaining having independence would be like taking back the power of self-government and to not hang from the power of others , not to be just a part hanging from the main source to be their own source.

So of course that usually what happened is that once the government , this new country separated and begin as independent , usually what they start to what happens inside this country is that maybe they have different regions with different cultures , different languages , different ideas.

So that they were all fighting together in order to gain independence , but they can also claim independence from that new country. And what usually happened is that these new governments denies the independence of these tiny regions of people.

So this same example can be fragilized until one individual , only one individual. Like in different regions , in different cities , villages and families. And then we have this individual that wants to separate to do something different , something new apart from the other ones. But that the other ones does not accept their freedom or independence because they do n't understand what they want to do.

So usually when people , the cultures , the civilizations , the nations celebrate the independence of some people , of some others , or when they gain independence in the past. But when they have to speak about setting free free or talking about the freedom of certain groups inside their own freedom , their own territory , the answer is no.

So they repeat exactly the same.

So why does this happen? Why some independence is good and why some independence is not.

So examples like this are many thousands in our history. It is difficult to understand why this would happen. Like for example , when the states get independence in the 1776 , again from the British , and immediately when they have this , the same states , they start to fight each other. They start to have this conflict that takes to the civil war , because some states from the south wanted to be different from the states from the north and the north put their power on the south.

And now we have the United States. And the same thing happened in Brazil , for example , when a great part of the country wanted to stay in the crown of Portugal , but the other ones were Republicans and they forced them to stay in the Republic , or in other countries like in South America and Central America. And they also forced other regions inside the same country to be part of a new country independent , but they did n't want it to be the same country they wanted to do another country and they were forced to be part of it.

So as we see , even today we have examples like in Scotland , like Catalonia , many territories that they could be different , they could become another country. And it wo n't be a problem if the people are independent from a territory , if they stay exchanging constantly like we do today.

So the concept of one country holding different territories that think different is something that is a very old idea regarding nationalism. Why? Because they were trying to take care of the power of a territory to hold economics , to hold population in order to take power. But today , in a time of networks , in a time of exchange , in a time of globalization , nationalism does n't make any sense.

It 's weird to think about this even today to take care of the country with only one capital taking care of many territories that think in a different way.

So as you see , the reason why we have , well , as you see , what we have been creating with nationalism has been because before was only one king or queen that said , I am the one that will take care of all of you. All this territory is mine and whoever lives in this territory will have a food , will have house and will have security.

So everyone will be safe here , everyone will be fine. If I am always in the power , you will be fine.

So they create like a brainwashed to all the people to make them believe that that territory was of them.

So they created the nationalism as an idea of protection of the only territory and to protect the same government.

So the government would create a idea that everyone that is outside is an enemy and all the enemies must be pulled out.

So that 's what a nationalism is. They believe that you belong to a territory. They believe that you are part of a group that will protect you. Whatever happens , this group will protect you and we create this concept of nationalism in order to keep the government working.

That 's the only goal. That 's the only thing.

So that 's why that 's the moment when we lose the real independence which is our own independence. And I will go now to the individual independence.

So the reason why exist a nation is because we wanted to make a bigger family.

So , followed the image. At the beginning , we have three individuals , one individual feminine and other individual masculine that propagate a new one , the kid.

So we have the first group here , mom , dad and some.

Okay.

So here we have some more people around.

So they create what we call a family. Family , remember comes from family that means hunger.

So the ones that share the food because they are starving. That 's the origin of the word family.

So we can say here that we have now three families because they get together , a son with a daughter , a daughter with a son.

So they get together and they create a group of families.

So we need someone picked from this family that will lead the herd. Is the one that will take care of all of them.

So then in the wrong times , at Pirelli , we 're divided in groups of three.

So they divide them for a new string in group.

So that 's why they were called three , Bruce , tribes , the name tribes. Or this new organization.

So what we have here is that this family here depends on the other. They share the food , they share the culture.

So that 's why they depend on one from the other.

So this person here is the one that tries for this three families to be together in order.

So that 's why these three needs to maintain this one for everyone to feel safe. This is why to did person , we give three , three boots , three boots.

So the one that has all this is attributes , attributes is the one that has all the tributes.

So suddenly more families will appear.

So this person here with so many families will become the regent , the one that leads that says what are the rules.

So that 's why it becomes the re which is the king Rex , he Latin.

So as much family start joining , much complicated become the culture. As many families we have here , a lot of cultures is complicated.

So what this person here in the center has to do is create an idea to unite them all.

So that would be to create one only language.

So all can understand , only one tradition and make them all like only one family.

So that 's how a nation is born. All thinking the same , speaking the same. This person here. Before was having tributes because the people note him because he was the same family.

But when there 's so many families , nobody know him. They only know that he 's the king. That 's why it becomes from tributes to taxes.

Something that is imposed obligated in Latin languages is imposed in post.

So let 's go back to this family here. This family had was where hungry.

So they saw that with the person here , the king , they were not hungry anymore.

So they started to trust all the other families to work harder in order to solve their problems of hunger and security.

So this person here that was hungry had a son , a kid , and told the story of how to survive. And they had another one and they told the same story. And another one and the same story. And now all this generations arrived to us with information in the genetics and the energy.

In the emotion of everything that happened this first one.

So now if we take this big as a tree , here you can see the tree. And what are all these new generations doing their hanging from the tree? And how do we call hanging from the tree? We call that to depend.

So because we have been depending from our ancestors , we behold inside the energy , the idea , the concepts that we are safe and secure. If we are part of a family , below a flag , a group. And now this is nature , this is not bad , this is fine. Because instead of this here , they pass atoms , molecules , chemical compounds , composed.

Nature needs to depend of others in order to exist.

So the problem is not to depend. What is the problem?

So now there were some people here that instead of being fighting to try to survive because they were hungry because they were fighting a war or whatever. They were able to just sit down and think , and wonder , is this the real way in which we can do it?

So they started to change things by thinking. They started to rethink the civilization created ours , the created more culture , philosophy. Science , knowledge. And that 's the reason why we are here.

That 's the reason why we are here speaking through a computer because of those people that had the time to think instead of just fighting or starving.

So suddenly what we have here is that all these people that were coming here until this one that had an idea. This person here caught the consequence of this tradition.

So this person broke the family heritage. Many that suddenly said , oh I got it.

Now I know. But from all of them , there were many of these people in the same time that decided , oh now I know I know another solution. But we only remember one because only one got to do it.

So why only one achieved to reach the transcendence? Because most of them were excited , pushed away by their own families because they were just dishonoring the tradition. They broke the clan. The biggest fear of an individual is not to have the clan to protect that person.

But the one that did this helped all the others to move forward in evolution.

So every person that did something different since the invention of the will , the discreet of agriculture. And all the things that had happened until now , every little discovered were changing the whole nations and the whole cultures. One day some people came had an idea they caught the head of the king , the queen , that 's the French Revolution. But now think about this.

The most of them denied by society. Why? Because their ideas were changing the comfort of the system. It 's because of the fear of being rejected in the security of the clan , of the system that we are incapable of being independent.

And this is why every time that something happens that we gain in the pen , all the clans get together as a nation and they say stay here below me that I will take care of you. This is how fear creates protection , protection creates control and control creates the penis.

So in order to be able to gain the independence , the real independence of the entire system , the thing we have to do is to gain the independence of our own clan. Because otherwise , what we are doing is to project the fear we have from our own clan into the entire system.

So from here what you have to do is to try to check from any therapy in the way that you could find what are those things from which you depend on your family and your plan. And also what are the biggest fears from which I depend on a nation. How many of you have felt the have felt proud or the pride of being American , the proud of being French , the proud of being German ever. When you feel proud , we can show up this idea that we are just holding a system that was created to control the individuals.

In individuals , we are independent from nature. But because we are afraid of being independent is that we are independent from nature. When we transcend the idea of the tendency of our clan , when we transcend the idea of nationalism , we start to be aware to be conscious that we are really independent. And with being independent , I do n't mean that we live the way that we just do n't connect with anything anymore.

## Daily Practice Elements

What I 'm really saying is that being independent is when you are not affected when you share with your family , when you share with friends , when you are in a relationship , when you are in a nation , in a system , because you are self-sufficient , because you are self-referred. That would be , let 's go to the information. The vibration for today is room. The statement for today is I am applied with them.

The code for today is Mars. The fourth closest planet to the Sun is the red planet that looks this way for its oxidation. It 's smaller than the Earth , much colder , and sets the boundaries from the inner rocky walls of the solar system. Mars comes from the name Marshal.

Bellied 's men , relating it this way to gravity , the strategy of war , the conflicts , the force , sexuality , will and bigger. It is located in the limit of the asteroid belt that divides the system from the gaseous giants. For that , it 's our expert against the rocks that tucked us. I become aware of the space that surrounds me.

## Energy Work

The body I inhabit. And in front of me , I have served a light which is small in the shape of the divine spark. It 's not. And take this divine spark to my crown chara.

I become aware in which of my beliefs I am dependent and in which sense independent. And in the 1990s , the crown chara is the most important thing. And in the 1990s , the crown chara , I applied this freedom in me. I descend this path to my third eye.

I recognize in which of my thoughts I depend and which ones I am independent. I apply in me the freedom of this concepts. And it not person. I descend this divine spark to my throat chara.

## Guided Meditation

I apply freedom and independence in this concept. I breathe and ignite all these divine spark into every direction of my body. I see the dependence of myself from the entire world. I see the dependence of myself from the entire world.

I am applied wisdom. I apply wisdom. I take it to breath and start to bring all these consciousness around my stretching and longing. Thank you for being here as always.
