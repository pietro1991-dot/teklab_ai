## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening. Hi everyone.

So I 've been wondering if we have to speak about this again or not if really worth it. But I guess that being in the emotional wake of areas is a yes.

So two things , the first thing. I am doing this kind of explanations and these kinds of things because I am setting my energy in the areas energy of this small. And then in every one of the moments , it happened something according to the energy that we are working with.

So this is kind of the energy that we are embracing this days.

So if I would be loving this week and the patient and all these kinds of things , it would n't be really the teachings of areas.

So I would like to say another thing , the second thing that once was the first time that I said it , I was ashamed of that. But taking the energy of areas , I 'm not ashamed anymore.

## Q&A

So I would say this example. If I would have been a politician and I said myself and I ca n't paint to ask you to vote for me and you elect me to be here in front of you. That would be something that makes me do everything to accomplish your expectations on me because the people that is watching will have an expectation on me. And I was selling that expectation.

So it 's okay. But I am not. I 'm doing this for myself. I was n't expecting here to accomplish any expectations of yours.

So I am doing my path and I 'm sharing it with you. It 's totally different.

So I 'm saying this because if someone is feeling that I am not accomplishing the expectations that you were expecting for me as a teacher.

So I 'm sorry. But yes , I 'm not. And another thing that I usually say is that I am not here to take care of my followers because I am not looking followers. I do n't care to have followers or not.

So I am not here to take care of followers. This is another truth. I expect for everyone to be able to follow themselves to be in the access. That 's the goal of the I am.

So as I said , everyone here is free to stay free to leave free to complain. Whatever you want , you are free to do it. And I will go to the energy that all this generates , which is theory.

So few thanks from the Latin food order and food order comes from February. February means to boil , but the team of the word comes from whole in the ground. I hope where you are well , where you can find water down there , well. But also much more concrete is connected to a well where you can find spring , a spring , hot waters.

So this means that is where the waters boil.

So , theory is related to the gathering of fire and water. Fire and water. Let 's see it from the point of view of a human energy.

So the fire , the first fire is the vital energy. The energy that moves and that goes up.

So it 's what we call the Kundalini. And then the emotional part is related with the water. And all the emotional things that we have within are related to the liquids that we have within.

So is what they used to call humor.

So remember that one month we spoke about the humor that they were different kind of liquids that the ancient people divided in our body. We 're interpreted from our body that moved the milk , that moved the emotions.

So that 's why the liquids , the humor , established the different kinds of animal states. And the image means soul , the soul.

So the animal states will be called humor. That 's why we have today this word , humor.

So when the inner fire starts to ignite the waters , the humor of the body starts to boil.

So we have here the check rest.

So we have here the check rest.

## Energy Work

So we have the root check right here , scrum , plexus , the heart , the throat , the eye , and the crumbs.

So the energy of the earth goes up and connects into the root check right.

So we ignite the fire , fire here going up is the one that we call cundalimid vital energy. It 's from here , from this chara through where appears positive and the negative. And the main energy divides into creating the movement of the cundalimid.

Okay , from the energy of the ground , from the energy of the ground and the energy of heaven , both of them get connected here , they collapse , which is where we call a conflict.

So this system here means that when the energy from heaven and the energy from earth get together , we create a conflict because both of them collapse and this collapse collapse of the energy creates the vital energy of the cundalimid.

So this creates here the force of the main energy of the cundalimid , but happen then that the crown here , which has the purpose and the idea , will call this energy to go up. It will be the cundalimid movement of this vital energy going up to this point here.

So the world of the ideas needs to manifest itself , but then the manifestation is going back to the world of the ideas. And that 's how the cycle begins.

So this is the kind of the descending of the divinity , and today I was just plain about the story of these divinity.

So here in this level is where we find the chaos , the conjunction , the everything and the nothing. Then this chaos will be the sign , will be download into the thoughts , the ideas , which is your answer. There in the heart we have the earth. And here between Trans and Gia , the earth we have cross , the time.

So here in the plexus , because of Trans and Gia appears the titans , which are the posits , the potentials.

So Trans and Gia has the titans as a children , because they are the first couple , having an earth like mother and father.

So both of them , they start to have the skits , but Trans does n't like much their own pid. Only the titans were good for him. The other ones , like giants , like the cyclone , they were not good for him.

So Gia , so Trans send them to hell to live in the underground.

So that 's why Gia has cross , one of his children , to take power over Trans and to set free their kids.

So now what happens is that cross with the tools of Gia will go and cut the bowls of Trans.

So no more bowls.

So what happens is that one fills in the ocean and the other one on earth. Basically the history says the spurs goes into the ocean , the blood goes into the ground. Positive and negative.

So from the positive side , who emerges Venus. Venus is the beauty of the good things of creation itself.

So in the other side we have it is in between many others.

So in the history , it is the one that the court , I do n't know their word.

So is the one that has the apple , the apple of Paris , the one that this court , okay , thank you.

So the apple of this court , who is the one that has to decide in between the three goddess and so.

So she 's the conflict basically.

So now these two Venus and Nris will be related to the hell , the main fire that comes from the underground in the hell.

So Venus will be in love in the term of love with the blacksmith of the hell , Alice.

So he would be the one falling love with Venus and Venus with him a weird couple. And Nris will have their first her daughters here in hell in the underground.

So here what we can have is this strange love story where is born the sexuality , the lower vibration of love never be here. And from Nris will be born all the contrary energies to this love.

So from this gathering of love in between the waters and the lava from the volcanoes both of them are the origin of life in the oceans both together create life itself. But we 'll also emerge something really terrible which is the boiling water that kills everything.

So how do we call the boiling waters theories.

So this is like a summary of how our own energy can be related to mythology and then how can we understand this process of positive and negative of the light aspect and the dark aspect of the root chara. This chara is where the conflict begins between love and theories. But also we have to understand this that is because of this. Of the ability in love and hatred in between the positive and the negative here that this conflict here that is created between these two sides can go up and start to move in the Kundalini way.

So this here explains how the conflicts are creating us basically it has been the conflicts between hydrogen oxygen carbon that created life. It 's been due to the conflicts that we have been going through in our history that allowed our evolution for a year.

So these two forces are the energy for the vital energy , vital movement.

So this energy here is the one that is vital for us to enlighten our light to ignite the light.

So what happened here?

Remember the gods , the story.

So now I think the story will be very familiar. The heaven and the earth are in conflict. The mind and the heart are in conflict. Because the mind , your items , wants to put its power upon the heart , the earth , the mind upon the heart.

And the heart because it does n't have any limits. It does n't also have logic understanding.

So it can love even the most horrible beast.

So what happened here is like , yeah , the mother tells to the time , chrono , to tell the mind , cut it. I do n't want to know about you anymore.

So when the mind , when the main idea disappear , the titan is to fight because of their potential. They start to fight for the crown , for the power above.

So that would be like seals with chrono fighting , which will be the being , the ego and the self fighting for the crown , for the throne.

So now what happened here is that when we do n't have the logic of the spirit , same , how to be in accessing a beast inside.

So the beast are released. And the beast , to this beautiful capital here , between the love of Venus and the health of Sides , and Are would say , hey , remember , I think he 's with another one , or she 's with another one. I think I saw it. And this creates a war between love and the hell that awakens the furious.

The furious are three. The furious are three. Rage. Fellows.

I do n't know how to spell it. Fellows , pinjellows. And revenge.

So basically , the only way in which this love can rise up in coherence is if that love , if that creation from the root chara has a meaning , has a proper idea , a purpose in the mind.

So that 's how it 's able to go up and rise the energy exploding like a volcano. If there 's no consciousness , there 's no understand. If there is no , if there is no thoughts , there 's no wisdom.

So I 'm going to be just touched today , wheel of time in karma all the time , once again. But if I can not even transcend , because of the time , I stay attached to the ground , to the earth , without any meaning , the chest limit here and now. But if , though , I am not allowing myself to live here and now , I 'm going to have a problem.

So what I will face is that all my potentials will try to rise up at the same time and they will be in conflict with the ego. And if I erase my potential ego , the only thing that I have is doubt. I have no idea why I am here , what to do , how to do it , no idea.

So if I do n't have anything more than doubts , all the main energy that was created , erupts into all the directions burning everything into ashes , releasing only rage , because I do n't know what to do. Well Lucy , because I have doubts on it and revenge , because it 's the only way that I feel I 'm going to gain back my energy. You get it?

So what is the importance of fury? How can we understand the importance of fury? Well , let 's think about the etymology of the word , boiling water. Without boiling water , without boiling meat , humans would n't be able to survive.

It 's because they use the fire to boil things that we actually survived through thousands of years.

So the boiling water was good because when the water is boiled , you do n't have bacteria.

So you survive.

So for example , the Greek people did n't call the furious as furious , because they did n't like for them to get mad at being called like this.

So what they did was to call them the good killers , the ones that brought the good things for the people. Why is this? Because the role of the furious is not a real story , it 's just mythology , of course. The role of the furious , where the benevolent beings that took care of the population by exposing , it 's feeling outside the killers , the assassins and the thieves.

So they used to call them in order to protect the people , because they were so rages and they were so protective that everyone that was about to do some harm to someone would be protected by them. In the same way as the boiling water can destroy your skin , your face or kill you or because they killed the back.

So when we speak about our own energy ecosystem , fury is so a good thing to use , in which way fury is this energy that we use in order to expel all the energies that come to our energy out.

So basically is a mechanism of the fence of our own energy.

So but the problem is that the same fury can become , if it is not in the balance in coherence with your own self , that same fury can explode and destroy everything that is around. Is the same energy , is the same energy , but the only difference is that I am not giving it coherence and I go to a purpose.

So here you are , in the thought of the mind that comes to the furious and say hey , calm down. We have to sit down to think about this to look properly into what is happening and find a goal , a purpose where to move through. And how do we call this to mind it to make a reflection. And when we go into that energy to the reflection of ourselves to see ourselves in the spectrum in front of us , how do we call that in Latin , respect from which means respect.

The respect is becoming aware about where am I heading my fury.

So in order to be released about this fury , release it with yourself , not with others with yourself , or just put a purpose on it and use it. The vibration for today is raw. The thing for today is I am with them in the world. The goal for today is the moon.

Four point five hundred billion years ago , an era in planet in the middle of the system formation collapsed with our world information similar to Venus creating a huge rather and reducing its size significantly by losing mass in a collision. The earth gravity this way it became our satellite every 28 days complete an entire cycle and its gravity. Once the waters of all it , releasing it this way with emotions with the mother spirit , with the hidden at night with the soul it means luminous for it illuminated in darkness. See the comfort table close your eyes and constantly writing your breathing.

## Guided Meditation

I become aware , stay safe find my plane , the body I inhabit on my own breathing will be on my own breathing. I have served a light which is my soul in the shape of a divine spark. I have knighted. I breathe in this divine spark to my crown.
