## Overview

Today we explore **fury**—the boiling point where inner fire meets emotional water.

This teaching dives deep into mythology, energy anatomy, and the mechanics of how anger becomes rage.

**Fury is not evil. It's energy seeking balance.**

## Core Teaching

### Setting Energy Intentionally

"I am doing these explanations because I am setting my energy in the Aries energy of this month. And in every one of the moments, something happens according to the energy we are working with."

The intensity you might feel in these teachings is intentional. It's Aries energy—direct, fierce, initiating.

"If I were loving and patient this week, it wouldn't really be the teachings of Aries."

### The Political Metaphor

Matias clarifies his relationship with followers:

"If I were a politician who asked you to vote for me, I would have to accomplish your expectations. But I am not. I'm doing this for myself and sharing it with you."

Key distinction: Politician sells expectations and must deliver them. Teacher sharing path has no obligation to meet your projections.

"I am not here to take care of my followers because I am not looking for followers. I expect everyone to be able to follow themselves—to be in the 'I Am.' That's the goal."

This is Aries energy: Clear boundaries, self-responsibility, no coddling.

### Etymology of Fury

Fudere (Latin) became February (month name).

Fudere means to boil.

But more specifically, it connects to well (hole in the ground where you find water), spring (where hot waters emerge), and hot springs (where waters boil from underground heat).

Fury is related to the gathering of fire and water.

When underground fire heats underground water, it boils and erupts as hot springs.

This is fury: the eruption of boiling emotions.

### Fire and Water in Human Energy

The first fire in the human system is vital energy—the Kundalini. This energy moves and goes up from the root chakra. It's the life force, the spark, the drive to exist.

The emotional part is related to water and the liquids in the body. Ancient peoples called these liquids humor—different fluids that moved through the body and created different emotional states.

Humor (Latin) equals liquid, moisture.

Animal states (emotional moods) were called humor because emotions were understood as liquids moving through the body. That's why we still say "sense of humor"—the flow of emotions creating lightness.

When the inner fire (Kundalini, vital energy) starts to ignite the waters (humor, emotions), the humor starts to boil.

This boiling equals fury.

### The Chakra System: Where Fury Is Born

At the root chakra, two energies meet: energy from Earth (grounding, material, body) and energy from Heaven (spirit, consciousness, crown).

These two energies collapse at the root—they conflict.

This conflict creates the vital energy (Kundalini). Without conflict, no movement. Without collapse, no spark.

Fury begins here: in the collision of opposite forces.

From the root, the energy divides into positive (one channel) and negative (other channel). This creates the spiral movement of Kundalini energy up the spine.

The crown (purpose, ideas, divine) calls this energy upward. The root (manifestation, earth, body) grounds it downward.

The tension between them equals life.

### Greek Mythology: Mapping the Chakras

Matias maps the chakras to Greek mythology:

Crown (Chaos): Everything and nothing, pure potential

Third Eye (Ideas): Uranus (sky, heaven, ideas descending)

Heart (Earth): Gaia (mother earth, manifestation)

Between Throat and Heart (Time): Chronos

Solar Plexus (Titans): The potentials, the first forces

### Uranus and Gaia: The First Couple

Uranus (heaven/sky) and Gaia (earth) create children: Titans (the good ones, according to Uranus) and Giants, Cyclops (the "bad" ones, sent to hell by Uranus).

Uranus doesn't like most of his children, so he sends them to Tartarus (underground hell).

Gaia, angry that her children are imprisoned, gives Chronos (one of the Titans) a tool to castrate Uranus.

### The Castration: Birth of Opposites

Chronos cuts off Uranus' genitals. They fall into the ocean (Venus is born—beauty, love, creation) and onto the earth (Eris is born—discord, conflict, strife).

Positive and negative from the same source.

### Venus and Hephaestus: Love in Hell

Venus (goddess of love) falls in love with Hephaestus (blacksmith of the underworld, god of fire and forge).

This is the union of love (water/beauty) with fire (hell/lava).

### Eris and Her Daughters: The Furies

Eris (discord) gives birth to her daughters in the underworld: The Furies.

The Furies are the contrary energies to love—rage, vengeance, madness.

### The Volcanic Origin of Life

Where does life begin?

In the oceans, where water (from above) and lava (from volcanoes below) meet and create the conditions for life.

But also: Where water and lava meet, they create boiling water that kills everything.

This is fury: The same force that creates life can destroy it.

### Fury as Creative and Destructive

The root chakra is where the conflict begins between love (Venus, water, creation) and fury (Eris, fire, destruction).

Both are necessary. Without the volcanic fire meeting the oceanic water, no life. Without the tension, no creation.

The root chakra governs sexuality (reproduction, creation, pleasure) and survival (fear, anger, defense). These are the same energy expressed differently.

When blocked or misused, sexuality becomes aggression. When expressed wisely, fury becomes creative force.

### Fury as Purification

The practice invites you to: "Allow this fury to boil in each chakra, cleaning all the things you need."

Fury is not to be suppressed. It's to be used as purification.

Like boiling water sterilizes, fury cleanses blocked energy.

Fire (Kundalini) plus Water (Emotions) equals Steam (Purification). The steam rises, carrying away what's stuck.

This is sacred alchemy.

## Practice

### Preparation

Sit comfortably. Become aware of your breath, space, and body.

Visualize a light—your soul as divine spark. Bring this light to your root chakra.

### Main Practice

Recognizing What Produces Fury: In each chakra, ask: "What produces fury in me here?" Then: "I allow this fury to boil, cleaning all the things I need."

Crown - Beliefs: What beliefs produce fury in you? Allow the fury to boil your crown, cleansing false ideas. Ignite the spark.

Third Eye - Thoughts: What thoughts produce fury? Allow fury to boil your third eye, clearing distorted perceptions. Ignite the spark.

Throat - Truth: What truths (or lies) produce fury? Allow fury to boil your throat, purifying your voice. Ignite the spark.

Heart - Feelings: What emotions produce fury? Allow fury to boil your heart, releasing blocked feelings. Ignite the spark.

Solar Plexus - Identity: What about yourself produces fury? Allow fury to boil your solar plexus, transforming your identity. Ignite the spark.

Sacral - Creation: What blocks your creativity and produces fury? Allow fury to boil your sacral, freeing creative energy. Ignite the spark.

Root - Reality: What in your reality produces fury? Allow fury to boil your root, cleansing survival fears. Ignite the spark.

Knees - History: What in your family history produces fury? Allow fury to boil your knees, releasing ancestral patterns. Ignite the spark.

Ankles - Purpose: What about your mission produces fury? Allow fury to boil your ankles, clarifying your direction. Ignite the spark.

Sound: Ro

I am wisdom in the world. I am wisdom in the world. I am wisdom in the world.

I am. I am. I am.

### Closing

Ignite all this fury around your body as fire coming out. Not to burn others—to purify yourself.

"I have the courage to find the coherence of my own self."

Take a deep breath. Stretch. Yawn. Return here and now.

## Key Insights

- Fury (fudere) = to boil, from Latin roots meaning hot springs where fire meets water underground
- Fire = Kundalini (vital energy going up); Water = Humor (emotions, liquids in body)
- When inner fire ignites emotional waters, the humor boils = fury
- Root chakra is where heaven energy and earth energy collapse/conflict, creating Kundalini spark
- Greek mythology maps to chakras: Chaos (crown), Uranus (third eye), Gaia (heart), Chronos (time), Titans (solar plexus)
- Uranus castrated by Chronos, genitals fall into ocean (Venus born—love/beauty) and onto earth (Eris born—discord/fury)
- Venus loves Hephaestus (fire god) = union of water/love with fire/lava in underworld
- Eris births the Furies in hell = contrary energies to love
- Life originates where ocean water meets volcanic lava—same place creates boiling water that kills
- Root chakra holds both love (creation) and fury (destruction)—same energy, different expression
- Fury as purification: Allow it to boil each chakra, cleaning stuck energy like steam sterilizes
- Sexuality and anger share same root energy; when blocked, sexuality becomes aggression

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

When fury arises today, don't suppress it.

Ask: "What is boiling within me? What fire is meeting what water?"

Then: "How can I let this boil to cleanse, not to destroy?"

### The Volcanic Metaphor

Remember: The same volcanic activity that creates **new land** (islands, fertile soil) also **destroys** (lava flows, ash).

Your fury is the same.

**Used wisely**: Creates new life, new energy, new possibilities.

**Used blindly**: Destroys relationships, health, peace.

**The fire is not the problem. The question is: Are you using it to create or destroy?**

### Mythology as Map

When fury appears, remember the myth:

- **Uranus** (your ideas) conflicts with **Gaia** (your reality)
- **Chronos** (time/patience) cuts the connection
- **Venus** (love) and **Eris** (fury) are born from the same wound

**You contain both.** The question is which you feed.

## Q&A

### Q: Is it ever okay to express fury outwardly?

Yes, when it's **clean fury**—fury that's been boiled/purified first, then expressed as clear boundary or truth. No, when it's **reactive fury**—unprocessed rage dumped on others.

### Q: How is fury different from the anger we worked with earlier this week?

Anger is the general energy. Fury is anger **at boiling point**—when fire and water meet and erupt. Fury is more intense, more volcanic.

### Q: Why does the root chakra hold both love and fury?

Because the root governs **survival and reproduction**—the two most primal drives. Love creates life (reproduction). Fury defends life (survival). Both essential.

### Q: How can I tell if my fury is creative or destructive?

Ask: "After this fury moves through, will something new be born? Or will things just be damaged?" Creative fury clears space for new life. Destructive fury just burns.

### Q: What if I never feel fury?

Then your fire may be suppressed, or your water frozen. Fury is **natural**. If you never feel it, you may be disconnected from your root, your survival instinct, your life force.

### Q: How does the mythological story help practically?

It shows you that **opposites come from the same source**. Love and fury, Venus and Eris—born from the same castration. When you feel fury, you're close to love. When you feel love, fury might be near. They're siblings, not enemies.

### Q: Why is February named after fury (fudere)?

February was the Roman month of **purification rituals**—when they would cleanse the city, homes, and selves. Boiling (fury) purifies. February = purification month.
