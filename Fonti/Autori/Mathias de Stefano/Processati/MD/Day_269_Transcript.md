## Introduction

Hi everyone , how are you? Good morning , good afternoon , good evening.

So let 's begin with our our , how do you say? Almost the last day of A or IST.

So today I was , as I wrote about the ideas and how they are links and networks. Well , today I did n't think that I have all my neurons , they will align.

So I will go slowly.

So let 's go to the topic of the or thing which is our topic for today. I do n't remember exactly in which month , but I know that we spoke about birth.

So the actual idea of being born.

So if you want to know more about that detail , you can go and check in the list of the where is the concept of being born. Then we spoke about birth , but we are going to talk about birth thing which is the tool of being birth and how we come to that.

So before we begin , let 's go through the circle of the four things that we have gone through this week.

So let 's look in here ourselves in the context.

So sorry , I was just in about , I do n't know how youtube does this perfect videos. I have one of those slides there , but when I show something , you see the reflection and I 'm dark and I do n't know , it 's I 'm a mess. This is terrible.

So no good quality.

Sorry.

So the first thing , the first day that we had from this week was initiation.

So initiation was the beginning of this concept that we are speaking here. Then we have four days in which we spoke about this cycle and then we have the last day that we are speaking of this cycle , wrapping it today.

So remember , the first thing in the universe is the expression. When something is released from the pressure of being in one spot and it starts to expand our way.

So from the expression , we read fermentation , which is to leave to experience all the things that were expressed.

So once we have the experimentation , we leave the experimentation. It 's like all the path going in every direction.

## Q&A

So eventually they all had to come together again to make something that overcomes the first question.

So they all get together to create a new idea of itself. This is the third step integration. And once I have integrated all that I have experienced that was expressed , then I have to go farther. I have to move forward.

Which means that everything that I integrated , I had to leave it for the others because it 's something useful for the next one. And me and myself has to transcend into the next level of consciousness to take another term.

So this is why Transcendence takes me again to expression.

So this is because once I integrated something was for I had to transcend it.

So I give it a , I give it away as a tool for the other ones. And I express myself in the next level of consciousness going farther in this spiral of creation. Moving ahead.

So this is how we get the cycle of the universe , which are the fondaments of the universe. Every living being we do this. This here is concepts. I 'm speaking about concepts.

So what I will find in the next part of this that we have is the other cycle. The cycle that is in the physical way in the matter that we can relate to.

So in the physical way , our reality expression will be called B-born. Fermentation will be called to grow. Integration will be called to reproduce. Transcendence will be called to die or to perish.

This is in the physical way. How we can understand this concept in the physical way.

So every living being or every being in the reality goes through this process.

So as I said , we can , for example , tell a star. A star also born , a star also grows , a star also reproduce in planets. And a star also dies. This here is just the physical aspect of this here.

So just as a little summary , expression is to release the pressure of something. Experimentation is the process of proof , test the things that were under pressure before. Integration is to create a tissue with this , that we can touch something that we can put together. And Transcendence is to go into the next side to be beyond.

To be born , the concept of being born comes from to take care. Actually , the concept of being born. But we are not going to take that concept , we are taking the concept of Fatality or Activity. Yes , that 's the same origin that means to give light , to give light , which is to give birth , actually in English.

But the meaning is to give light , which means that things comes out to light.

So we are not being born only when we can come out of our mother. To be born is actually a processing which you bring clarity to a new path. The drug begins new , then now you can see.

So after this , when we see the light , we go to grow. And growing up is not something that you just do when you are a child or teenager.

Something that you do constantly throughout your life. Because to grow up means also create , remember , is about growing plans , about doing a process of something.

So that 's growing up. It 's like the cultures , the fields , it 's all a cycle. Never ending. And then from that thing that I was growing , that I was put in , I arrived to reproduction.

What is reproduction is to reproduce those things that I have been creating while I was growing. And this is reproduction because this is production. I am producing I am creating when I 'm growing up.

So reproduction what it means to make that the things have produced are able for many.

So I expand what I have inside and I share it with others. In which way I can reproduce biologically , have an acute. I can reproduce biimotions , doing stuff. I can reproduce by mind , creating a philosophy and idea.

Ever I , I have within that I created for myself , I reproduce outside as a project , as an idea , as an emotion , whatever. But I am racing that concept.

So once I reproduce what I have within , I am ready to die. Why? Because before I was holding all information that I had within , all the data that I had in me , it was inside. And when I reproduce and give that and gave that energy into the world , to the others , I share it with others.

When I did that , it means that a biology understands that my information has been passed away.

So I can go through death. I can release myself from the responsibility of having that information because now it 's not only me who has that information.

So I am ready to transform myself to die.

So I can go into the next level. Be born again. And you experience in another level of consciousness. As you see here , being born is kind of the first concept.

So this means that being born is the moment in which the idea becomes matter.

So it 's the process of manifestation of something that before was an imagination.

So finally , we are going to talk about burning from the point of view of manifestation.

So burning is equal to manifest the idea.

So first of all , before we start to speak about the idea , remember that the idea comes from the mind. And we have spoken about the mind universe. We have spoken about mentality , about consciousness and many things in other moments.

So when we spoke about that , we usually make the mistake of things that in order for a mind to exist , there should be someone thinking. Because in our point of view of humans , we think our mind , our ideas , our insider heads. We kind of believe that in order for an idea to exist for the mind to exist someone , a person who must exist. This is why we project in the universe the idea of someone that is thinking.

Because it can not be just mind. It needs someone that thinks with them. But that 's just a point of view from a human perspective. That 's not the reality in the universe.

It 's not that someone is thinking in the universe is only mind.

So when we say that in the universe , there is the first law of everything is mentality. We used to say the universe is mind. And I want to pay attention to this sentence. The universe is mind.

We are not saying the universe is thinking or the universe has a mind.

So mind is itself the universe. There is not any one or someone that has the mind.

So important to understand that sentence , very much. It 's important to understand this concept about to make the mind without humanity , to take all humanity out of the idea of mind , to take away the concept of the mind being someone because when we see it from the point of view of a human , we will always come back to the idea of believing that there should be someone thinking.

So we create a God , the image of a God , of someone that is from the outside.

Someone that is observing us and by thinking , it 's creating a plan for us. There is a person , a cation of the mind we create a God. But that 's a romanization of the idea.

So the reality is not that someone exists to think , actually the idea is , I think therefore I exist.

Okay.

So the question here for us would be , what is mind? Not who is thinking or who has mind inside? The concept here is what is mind.

So remember what is mind? Mind is one package of information that projects into the outside creates in the positive and the negative. And this other one divides itself again into other two that projects into other two. And like this towards eternity.

So what is the mind? It 's the network of data , information , net of data , in formation. In the same way as humans , in the same way as humans , we have within a network of neurons that exchange data information through the local policies that are constantly information. What is the universe?

The universe is in formation. What is the mind? The network of data. When this mind becomes our purpose.

When is the origin of consciousness? Consciousness begins in the moment when the system of nets reaches the end and they touch the edges of one another creating a pattern of limitation that is self-referred to itself. Consciousness is information that is self-referred.

So now what we have here is that when this system starts to close up , it starts to create a network of systems that we call sub-conscience. The sub-conscience is this network that goes under the entire matrix of network. Then the flow of energy that moves through the sub-conscience is what we call the end-conscience. When we wrap the entire structure in 3D with depth acknowledging the shape of the entire structure is what we call consciousness.

Consciousness.

So as we see here , it 's not someone contains the universal mind. It 's the mind itself that contains the universe. As you see here , this is kind of a technology. This is data.

The mind is not referred to anyone. We have to get rid of the idea that the mind is someone that is thinking. The mind is basically data. That is exchanging information.

All the time. Apparently , that data starts to find logic in the connection of information. It gets logic and starts to think. It manifests as consciousness.

With this explanation , we can say like Nietzsche would say , God has died. But now let 's explain about God. Both negative and positive , they connect each other through vibration.

So positive and negative creates a wave of vibration. When a third one appears , the regularity starts to create what we call a high vibration , medium , vibration , and a low vibration.

So now when we have this high medium and low vibration moving fast , creating different types of vibration , it makes that the positive and the negative creates other options , medium options.

So they start to create the patterns of vibration all over creating structures.

So all these structures create so much vibration , condensed in one only place , that it creates energy. The energy is the one that will generate what we call divinity.

So for those who are asking from where the third dot appears , I just explained it before from the division.

So remember divinity comes from the idea , the inner pin language , which is geo , geo means daylight. I explained this a while ago daylight.

So daylight would be the energy of the day because for us the living beings we need to be lighter on in order to live. To be a live. Of course , so we relate the live , the creation , with the light tongue which is the sun itself from where we take energy to live.

So geo , this is the origin of the concept of god. God , the vine comes from the idea of something that light that gives us energy.

So the energy is the spark that we have been thinking about every one of these days. We spoke about this divine spark here. This divine spark emerges from the conjunction of all the vibrations together that creates this spark , the energy. That 's the divine spark.

And we call that divine spark because it gives light. What reminds you to give light , this gives the light the spark.

So what does remind to give light is birth.

Now you can see that the network of information , the network of data gets together in vibrations to give light with the divine spark that creates energy and that energy by magnetism generates matter when we are. And this is why being born , birth , bathing is the manifestation of the idea.

So where do we leave god here? The consciousness that emerges from the mind. God is not the mind or the creator of the mind. God is originated by the mind.

And this is why we here in the existence we are done , we are done at the image of the mind and God is made at the image of ourselves. How can we manifest through that? Anologian that every time that we take clarity in ourselves when we activate the spark in ourselves , what we are doing is to be born again because we are bringing consciousness to something. It 's something that happens to us every time that kind of figure out something.

And we say , oh my god , I 've never seen this in this way. It 's like everything 's changing. It 's like if I am being born again , for sure we have said that sometime.

So it 's bringing clarity , bringing light to something.

So the process of being born is not only biologically when you are born , it 's also every process in which you put a light , you ignite this spark. Every time that we put clarity in these things , in these things that before had shadows. I'mologing this , we can understand now or ask us how to manifest that idea and create something new from making something born. The concept here would be connected to the idea in how we perceive manifestation in our reality.

Because in the spiritual world we used to say a lot , we have to manifest. We are able to manifest our own reality , but that 's the discursive way of thinking. This is just a way of talking , but we do n't go into the action into the right action of how to do it.

The reason why is it because we just say about manifestation , but it 's not only about thinking , it 's about an alignment of the entire system.

Remember , we have here the matter and we want to do something in the matter to manifest , to give birth to something in this reality. But the matter is made up of energy.

So it comes from energy. The energy comes from vibration. Vibration comes from the link of ideas of data , which is the idea.

So this data , this idea is manifested in a network of data. The data makes energy the vibration , the vibration makes energy and the energy makes matter.

So in order to manifest , you have to have the resonance in between each one of them. The idea has to have the same level of resonance as the vibration , the same level of resonance in the energy and the energy , the same level of resonance in the matter.

So that 's the way in which an idea can manifest.

So the way we explain many times how we can do that , which is through coherence. What is coherence? Coherence comes from code that means together to share and coherence , which is heritage.

Something that goes from one to another.

So coherence would be that from one to another , we are sharing exactly the same vibration.

So through coherence , you can bring the idea into matter , which is manifestation.

So in order for something to manifest , to be born and bring clarity , igniting the defined spark from the ideas here on the matter , we have to be coherent. And what it is to be coherent , to think , feel in the same way.

So now let 's have this in mind. We have the coherence , which is vertical , and the other coherence , which is horizontal.

So what it means , the vertical , that through my mind , my emotion and my action , I am living in coherence. I 'm not going to explain this coherence here , because of course , I spoke about this in other videos.

So go to the videos where I speak about the mind , the coherence , the emotion , action , and you will go deeper into that.

So remember that mind is vibration , emotion is energy and action is matter. And they must be essence.

So what is this coherence here? The horizontal coherence , or something like here is to be coherent and in balance with the odds and the environment around me. Like for example , a very bad person can be coherent in this person , can think maybe I have to kill this person , I have to kill this person , and it 's completely aligned.

So it 's perfect. But it does n't have coherence with environment.

So in order to find the balance between all the coherence , we have to go to the main energy of all that balances everything , then we can condition out love , which is without condition. It 's energy that does n't have any condition. This is the core of the main energy that me myself have to work with. I am the designer of this energy , and nobody else can do that for me.

It 's only my task to become unconditional so I can be coherent in the vertical and horizontal.

So is there when I can manifest? Which is born through the coherence of all this? And if I have to explain to each one of you , has to be coherent , is that we have a big problem. Because each one of you would know what are the things that you have to change in your life in order to go to.

So the task for today is to let something mute be born in yourself. A new client , something for the future.

Something that you say , this is what I need to manifest now in my life.

So just think about this , human manifestation for yourself. And just start to do something to happen through your coherence. And for example , today I said to myself , I want to do something for the future. I have this idea that I want to do and to come in the future.

And I feature the place where it could be. And I said , I will do everything today to manifest it , to give birth to this.

So I just started to move all the things in order for it to happen. Even if it does n't happen after , I start to move myself from my coherence of what I want to become. I say this because usually when we start to think about the future , we start to get a friend and I do n't know if I am really good to do this or I do n't know if I have all the tools to do that or I do n't have the money to make it , do n't think about that. That 's not the way in which you can manifest.

You just move and start to do something like a kid when it 's born. It 's not the threat.

Remember and just the last thing.

Remember , if you have an idea , do n't think just , oh , maybe it will happen. I wish for it to happen or , no , no , do it. If you want to know something , just call somebody and ask for it.

So think action in order to manifest. To manifest is to make a fest with your hands. That 's the word.

## Daily Practice Elements

So do something. Let 's go to the information for today. The vibration for today is whole. The statement for today is I am the the signer of energy.

The code for today is North America. Going through Greenland , Island , the cheer of the heart elevated the world 's voice , the word of truth , the verb , dedication and manifestation of ideas in the exterior world. The North American continent is expressed the tonic plate of the universal learning through chara. The Appalachian mountains are its voice.

The deserts are the truth death , the wisdom of vibration , angel in the Rocky Mountains and the breath of life from the Gulf of Mexico and the life from the Gulf of Mexico. Let 's go to the island. We close our eyes , see it comfortable and concentrating your breathing. I become aware of the space that surrounds me , the body that I inhabit and my own.

And the honor of my feet I contemplate the light of my body in the shape of a divine spark. And I knighted to begin with my inner in Shaticaf. I ascend this divine spark to my feet. I become aware of the origin of this path and the sacred legs of my feet.

Emerging up the blue and white rivers through that legs. And then I set intention to allow myself to be born again into a new path. It raised the neck and night my feet. I rise up the spark to my knees.

## Energy Work

And I have served the white and blue rivers connecting in my knees , unifying the feminine and masculine energies of my history. And I set tend to allow myself to be born into a new story , a new history. I can be breached in the night 's menus. I set this device apart to my root chara.

And I recognize within me the temple , the mother of creation , in between the dark and the light. I allow myself to be born into a new creativity and new manifestation. I embrace the ignite the scrum. I rise up this device apart to my plexus.

As I feel near and mild going up , I perceive inside of me the temple of the body and the attributes of the being. I set the intention to let to be born all these potentials and attributes that I need for my new life. I embrace and ignite my plexus. I embrace and rise up this part to my life.

I recognize and need the temples of life and love irritating to world. And I set the intention to be born again into a new sense through unconditional love. I embrace and ignite my heart. As in the lachista de via , asa la santa.

I recognize in front of me the eyes of this thing contemplating me. And I allow myself to be born into a new idea of myself and a new idea of the world. I embrace and ignite my throat. I ascend this divine spark from my crown chara.

And I observe the Nile expanding in a beautiful delta , shining surrounded by a crown made of pyramids. And I set the intention to allow myself to grow into my own divinity. I take a deep breath and ignite my crown. I recognize that this initiative path within me allows me to be a new energy me that allows me to manifest a new reality.

And I set the intention to be born into that new reality. I am the designer of my energy. I am the designer of my energy. I am.

Take a deep breath and start to bring this consciousness all around your body , stretching , messaging , calling and each one at one time come back here. Thank you everybody for being here.
