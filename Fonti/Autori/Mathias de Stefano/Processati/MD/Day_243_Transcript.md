## Overview

Today we arrive at the throat chakra of the Mental Week of Aries. The topic is the question **What for?**

Today in Egypt, we witnessed the Golden Parade of the Pharaohs—25 pharaohs, queens, and kings transported from the old museum in central Cairo to the new Museum of Ancient Civilizations. It was a powerful example of **honoring the past**.

Now let's explore how "What for?" connects us to the future while honoring what came before.

---

## Etymology of "What For"

### Two Parts

"What for" has two parts:
- **What** comes from **quo** in European language, meaning **a thing**, a concrete thing we are going to speak about
- **For** comes from the Latin word **pro**, meaning **ahead**, something that is in front

### The Future Aspect

"What for?" is the question that speaks about the **future** of things, the **goal** of the things we do.

---

## Cause and Effect

### The Law of the Universe

Remember one of the laws of the universe: **cause and effect**.

- The question "Why?" goes to the **origin**, to the **causes** of things
- The question "What for?" goes to the **effects** of things, to the **future** aspects

### Reaching the Origin

Yesterday we spoke about "Why?" going to the origin of things.

As much as you go to the origin, you will find the very beginning, the very original cause of all things.

That means before that, there's nothing—it is the **eternal origin**.

### Before the Beginning: Only Future

This means there is no other origin or cause to that main cause.

There is no past and no present in the beginning of the universe.

The first thing existing is **the future**—the future is all the possibilities of that cause.

### Why "What For?" Comes Next

When you reach the very origin of all the causes, you can only find possibilities that come from that cause, from that origin.

That's why the next question someone must ask is **"What for?"**—which is regarding the future, the future of things.

---

## What For Allows Transformation

### Finding Different Possibilities

The question "What for?" is the one that allows us to find different possibilities and different perspectives of one answer.

Without the question "What for?" we wouldn't be able to find new ways to transform ourselves, to change.

### The Key to Move Forward

The question "What for?" is a key that allows us to move forward towards the future.

---

## Success: A Misunderstood Concept

### What We Think Success Means

When we think about the future, we usually relate the goal of the future with **success**.

When we think about success, we start to believe that the main goal of everything in our life is to **achieve our goals** and find the purpose of what we are seeking.

### Different Definitions of Success

Success can be seen from different points of view:
- To have money
- To reach the top of the mountain
- To connect with yourself through meditation
- To reach inner peace
- Mental, emotional, or physical achievements

### The Capitalistic Misunderstanding

We live in a world that has been using the capitalistic idea for globalization according to **competition**—to be over others, to reach physical things.

We can have organic capitalism, but we don't have that today. We have capitalism according to competition.

This is why many spiritual people think about success as something wrong or bad.

But people living in our society consider success good—just misunderstood.

---

## The True Etymology of Success

### Success as Destination vs. Exit Point

We have a great mistake regarding the word "success."

In our society, we consider success as a **destiny**, a **place** where we have to go, something to reach.

But success really means **a point from where you get out**.

### Sequence and Success

The concept of success comes from the etymology **sequence**—the one that follows a sequence of things.

Success is something that is under another thing and keeps going, keeps following something new.

It's not related to reaching one place but to **follow and keep moving** from one place to another.

### Exit: The Spanish Clarity

In Spanish, we have the word **"éxito"** to describe success, which is the same origin of the word **"exit"** in English.

Exit is from where you **go out**.

It's not something you reach; it's from where you go.

### True Success = Constant Transformation

The one that has really success is **the one that transforms constantly**.

Once we understand this concept of success, we can really get the point of the question "What for?"

---

## Using "What For" to Transform

### The Practice of Asking

Example:
- "I want to be rich."
- "What for?"
- "To be free or to be happy."
- "What for?"

You keep asking "What for?" once and again, once and again.

### Why Do This?

The reason is the same as asking "Why?"

With "Why?" you go back and back looking for the origin.

With "What for?" you ask forward and forward to find the answer for the **purpose**.

### Reaching the Purpose

As much as you ask "What for?" to everything that you want to do, you reach the idea of **the purpose**.

---

## Why "What For?" and Success Are Linked

### Both About Moving Forward

The main concept of success is to **move forward**.

The main concept of "What for?" is to make you **doubt** in that objective, that goal you had in your life.

### Transforming the Goal

When you ask "What for?" to each one of your goals in life, you allow yourself to **transform** the goal of success.

You are really succeeding in your life because you are **transcending the previous idea**.

### Setting Ourselves Free

Thanks to the question "What for?" we set ourselves free from the idea of a fixed goal of being successful.

We set ourselves free so we can keep moving, keep transforming ourselves, and not be stuck in the past in one only idea.

---

## Conditional vs. Unconditional "What For"

### What Is a Condition?

**Condition** comes from Latin **con di kit**, which means something that is said by all of us, something we have decided by speaking together.

A condition means we already said something and decided this is the way it is, and we cannot change it.

### Conditional Language

Remember conditional sentences?

They use "if":
- "I'm going to do this **if** I do that."
- "I can go to that place **if** I go to this place first."
- "I will do this **if** I first accomplish that."

A conditional is: you're going to do something **if** there's another thing that allows you to.

### Conditional "What For" (From the Ego)

Example:
- "What is this goal for **if** at the end everything is the same?"
- "What for **if** it will never change?"
- "What for **if** no one listens?"

These questions are made from the **ego**. The conditional is from the ego trying to take control of all things.

### Unconditional "What For" (From the Being)

The unconditional way of asking "What for?" is like that person willing to learn how to do things, open to all possibilities.

Questions like:
- "What is this for?"
- "What is that for?"

These questions are in order to find new ways of doing things, to figure out new paths.

### Adult vs. Child

We could say:
- The conditional "What for?" is from an **adult** frustrated in the things they're doing
- The unconditional "What for?" is from a **kid** willing to learn a new way of doing things

---

## The Practice: From Where Do You Ask?

### The Question for Yourself

From where do you ask the question "What for?"

From the **conditional** or the **unconditional**?

### The Task for Today

Write all the questions you have within that start with **"What for?"**

Just write the questions—doesn't matter the answer. Just the questions.

### Being Honest

When you write these questions, think: from where are you writing them?

Are you writing them to be successful in a fixed purpose, reaching a goal?

Or are you writing them to **transform**, **transcend**, **evolve**, go beyond?

### No Judgment

Be sincere with your questions and answers. This is not an exam. No one is judging you.

If you write from the ego, that's fine—at least you know. Then you can choose to transform.

## Integration

### Daily Awareness

Today, notice when you set a goal and think it's the final destination.

Then ask: "What for?" Keep asking until the goal transforms into something deeper.

### Transforming Success

Identify one area where you think you've "failed" because you didn't reach a goal.

Ask: "What for was I trying to reach that?"

Keep asking until you see that you were actually succeeding by transforming, even if you didn't stay in one place.

### From Conditional to Unconditional

Notice when you ask "What for?" in a frustrated, conditional way ("What for if...").

Reframe it into unconditional curiosity ("What is this experience for? What can I learn?").

---

## Week Context

Mental Week of Aries—Questions that Ignite Consciousness:

- Day 1 (Crown): What? (object)
- Day 2 (Third Eye): Why? (cause/origin)
- Day 3 (Throat): What for? (effect/purpose)
- Day 4 (Heart): Which? (quality/choice)
- Continuing through Day 10...

Each question builds on the previous, creating a complete map of conscious inquiry.

## Q&A

### Q: If I keep asking "What for?" won't I never achieve anything?

No. Asking "What for?" doesn't stop action—it transforms your understanding of why you're acting. You still achieve, but you're no longer attached to fixed outcomes. You're free to transform.

### Q: How do I know when to stop asking "What for?"

When you reach a purpose that feels like expansion rather than limitation. Or when you answer "What for?" with "Why not?"—pure possibility.

### Q: Isn't this just overthinking?

No. Overthinking tries to control the future. This practice opens the future to transformation. One contracts, one expands.

### Q: What if my "What for?" reveals that my goal isn't what I really want?

Perfect. That's the point. The question frees you from goals that were never truly yours. Now you can find what you actually want.

### Q: How is this different from asking "What's the point?"

"What's the point?" usually comes from cynicism or giving up. "What for?" comes from genuine curiosity about purpose and transformation.

### Q: Can I use "What for?" to help others?

Yes, but ask from the unconditional perspective, inviting exploration: "What is this for you?" not "What for if it won't work?"

### Q: What if I discover I'm doing everything for conditional reasons?

Then you've made a profound discovery. Now you can choose: keep the conditional goals consciously, or transform them into unconditional exploration.
