## Overview

Day 39 brings one of the most counterintuitive teachings of the entire series: **destiny doesn't mean "to go"—it means "to stay."** This isn't wordplay. It's a complete reframe of how we understand purpose, mission, and the direction of our lives.

We've been conditioned to think of destiny as something we're traveling toward—a destination we must reach, a place we must arrive at, a goal we must achieve. But Matias dismantles this: **the ocean doesn't go anywhere. The ocean stays. And all the rivers come to it.**

The ankles—the pivot point between the feet and the legs—become the physical anchor for this teaching. The ankles allow us to shift, adjust, pivot, adapt while remaining rooted. They're the joint that permits **flexibility without abandonment of position.**

This day distinguishes between **mission** and **purpose**. Missions are things you do, tasks you complete, actions you take. Purpose is what you ARE. You can have many missions in a lifetime, but only one purpose—your essential vibration, the frequency you're here to emit.

The teaching confronts the modern obsession with **going, doing, achieving, arriving**. We're exhausted from chasing destinations. We've confused motion with progress, activity with purpose. The ankles say: stay rooted in what you are, and flex to meet what comes.

This is mastery: not controlling outcomes, not forcing your way to predetermined destinations, but **vibrating so clearly at your essential frequency that everything aligned with that frequency finds you.** The ocean doesn't chase the rivers. The rivers come to the ocean because the ocean is what it is.

## Core Teaching

### The Ankles: Pivot Point Between Earth and Movement

Good morning, good evening, good night, everyone. Today we continue with the root chakra. We are working with the mental in the root.

Today we are working specifically with the **ankles**—the ankles, the chakra in the ankles. Remember, we are working with the 12 chakras. The feet, the knees, the ankles, the root in the genitals, the sacrum, the plexus, the heart, the throat, the third eye, the crown, the aura around the body, and the center of the Earth below the feet.

We are on the root, the mental week. We've worked with attributes (our strengths and weaknesses), with advance (how we step forward or backward). Today we work with the ankles and the concept of **destination**.

### Destiny: To Stay, Not To Go

One of the main things we have to understand about this chakra, about the ankles, is the **concept of destination and destiny**—what are we destined to.

Usually we think about the destiny as something we are going. "I'm destined to go there." "I'm destined to be there." "I'm destined to do that."

But the real meaning of the word **destiny** is—means **"to stay."**

**Destiny doesn't mean to go. Destiny means to stay.**

This is a very important concept because what we have to do is not to force ourselves to go anywhere to find our destiny. **What we have to do is to stay long enough in the vibration I am in order to realize what my destiny is.**

### The Ocean Metaphor: All Rivers Come to You

Let me make a very good example with this. Imagine the ocean. Picture the ocean in your mind—a big ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, any ocean.

**The ocean doesn't go anywhere. The ocean stays.**

All the rivers—all the rivers of the continents, all the rivers of the world—they come to the ocean. **The ocean doesn't move. The ocean doesn't have to go to look for the rivers. The rivers come to the ocean.**

Why do the rivers come to the ocean? **Because the ocean is being the ocean. The ocean is vibrating as the ocean.**

Because the ocean is what it is, all the rivers know: "That's where I have to go. That's where I have to arrive."

### You Are the Ocean, Not the River

**You are the ocean. You are not the river.**

The rivers are all the things that happened to you, all the experiences, all the knowledge, all the wisdom, all the people, all the situations—they come to you. They flow into you.

**Your mission is not to go out and collect the rivers. Your mission is to BE the ocean, so the rivers know where to come.**

This is the meaning of destiny. **Destiny is the vibration you stay in. Destiny is what you ARE, not where you go.**

### Missions vs. Purpose

Now, we have to make a distinction here between **mission** and **purpose**.

**Mission** is something you do. Missions are the things, the tasks, the actions, the works, the relationships—these are missions. You can have many missions in your life. You might have 10 missions, 20 missions, 100 missions.

**Purpose** is what you are. **Purpose is your vibration. Purpose is your essence.** You only have one purpose—one essential frequency you're here to emit.

The missions come and go. **The purpose stays.**

Think about it this way: The ocean might have many rivers coming into it—the Mississippi River, the Amazon River, the Nile River. These are like missions. They come, they pour into the ocean, they complete their flow.

But the ocean itself—the salt, the depth, the vastness, the ability to receive and hold water—**that's the purpose. That never changes.**

### The Ankles: Flexibility While Staying

The ankles are the perfect physical representation of this teaching. **The ankles allow you to pivot, to adjust, to flex, to move in different directions—all while staying rooted in the same place.**

When you're standing, your feet stay on the ground. But your ankles can shift your weight, can adjust your balance, can pivot your body in different directions. **You move, but you don't go anywhere.**

This is mastery. This is what the ankles teach: **adaptability without abandonment. Flexibility without loss of center.**

### Weak Ankles, Weak Destiny Sense

People who have weak ankles, who have pain in their ankles, who twist their ankles constantly—these are people who have a weak sense of destiny. They don't know what they're here to BE. They only know what they think they're supposed to DO.

They're constantly trying to go somewhere, to become something else, to reach some destination. And because they're not rooted in their purpose, their vibration, they keep stumbling. **They keep falling because they're not standing in what they are.**

### The Delusion of Destination

Our whole culture is based on the delusion of destination. "When I get there, then I'll be happy." "When I achieve that, then I'll be fulfilled." "When I arrive at that place, that status, that relationship, that amount of money—then I'll have made it."

But you never arrive. There's always another destination beyond the one you just reached. **You spend your whole life going, and you never just ARE.**

The ankles say: **Stop going. Start being.**

Not in a passive way—not in a "do nothing and wait for life to happen" way. But in the way the ocean is: **actively being what you are, vibrating at your frequency, so powerfully and so clearly that everything meant for you finds you.**

### The Task: What Is My Vibration?

The task for today is to contemplate, to write if needed: **What is my vibration? What is my purpose—not my missions, but my purpose?**

This is a hard question. Most of us have spent so much time thinking about what we should DO that we have no idea what we ARE.

Some prompts to help:
- When I'm at my best, what quality am I emanating?
- What do people feel when they're around me?
- If I could be described in one word, not for what I do but for what I AM, what would it be?
- What is the essence I bring to everything I touch?

Maybe you're a nurturer. Maybe you're a truth-teller. Maybe you're a bridge. Maybe you're a catalyst. Maybe you're a holder of space. Maybe you're a light in darkness.

**That's your vibration. That's your purpose. That's your destiny.**

All your missions—your jobs, your relationships, your projects—are just rivers flowing into that ocean.

## Practice

### Preparation

We start, as always, by caressing my body, massaging my body, allowing myself to thank my physical body for being the anchor of my spirit in the matter.

Focus very deep on my breathing. Feel how the air, the oxygen, starts to come through my nose, going to my lungs, my heart, my blood, my organs, my muscles.

### Alignment Practice: Activating the Ankles

1. **Feel the heat expanding.** Allow myself to feel the heat within my body, how it starts to go out through my skin, filling up my aura, all my magnetical field.

2. **Connect with the I Am.** Think about the I Am as a light over my head. With each breathing, bring all the heat, all the energy around my body, towards the I Am, the higher self, as a spiral, feeding the light, making it brighter and brighter and brighter.

3. **Descend through all chakras.** Allow myself to bring the light of the I Am through all my body. Take a deep breath: third eye, throat, heart, plexus, sacrum, root, knees, **ankles**, feet.

4. **Light the ankles.** Feel the light of the I Am within my body, taking all the information from the mind we have worked with all these days. Feel the I Am touching all that information in my ankles.

5. **Root into your vibration.** Recognize: My ankles allow me to stay rooted in my purpose while flexibly meeting what comes. I am not chasing destinations. I am BEING my destiny.

6. **Feel the ocean within.** I am the ocean. I stay. I vibrate. I receive. All that is meant for me comes to me. I don't chase the rivers—the rivers come to the ocean.

7. **Feel the energy spiral.** From my feet, the energy starts to go out, going up, around my body as an egg of light, surrounding me, coming again to my head. I use my hands if needed to touch it, to feel it, to help it get to my crown. I Am. I Am.

8. **Pronounce the vibration.** Take a deep breath. Start to make the sound, the vibration that comes from my body towards all the directions, towards the eternity of my being: **Nü... Nü... Nü... Nü...**

9. **Declare the statement.** Take a deep breath. Saying it towards all the directions, the eternity of myself: "I am the Emissary of Masters. I am the Emissary of Mastery. I am the Emissary of Masters. I am the Emissary of Mastery."

### Closing

Take a deep breath. We take our hands to our hearts. Recognize: "I am not going anywhere to find my destiny. My destiny is what I AM, here and now. I stay in my vibration. I flex to meet what comes. I am the ocean. The rivers come to me. I am the Emissary of Mastery."

Take the consciousness with my hands to every part of my body. Stretching, caressing, massaging, yawning, we come back and gently open my eyes.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task:** Contemplate and write:

**What is my vibration? What is my purpose (not my missions)?**

Some questions to help you discover this:
- When I'm at my most authentic, what quality am I radiating?
- What do people consistently experience when they're around me at my best?
- If I were a force of nature (ocean, mountain, fire, wind), what would I be?
- What is the one-word essence I bring to everything I touch?
- What do I do effortlessly that others find difficult?

This isn't about what you DO for work or what roles you play. It's about the essential frequency of your being.

Examples:
- "I am a space-holder. My vibration is safety."
- "I am a truth-mirror. My vibration is clarity."
- "I am a catalyst. My vibration is transformation."
- "I am a nurturer. My vibration is growth."

Once you've identified your vibration/purpose, notice: Are your current missions (job, relationships, activities) rivers flowing into that ocean? Or are you trying to be a different ocean than you actually are?

### Applying This Teaching

Throughout your day, notice when you're "going" versus "being."

When you're anxious, stressed, rushing—you're probably in "going" mode, chasing some destination, trying to get somewhere other than where you are.

When you're present, grounded, emanating your essence regardless of what you're doing—you're in "being" mode, the ocean mode.

Notice your ankles. Are they tense, rigid, locked? That's "going" energy—trying to force yourself toward something. Consciously relax your ankles, soften them, allow them to be flexible. Feel how that changes your whole presence.

When opportunities arise, ask: "Is this a river coming to my ocean, or am I chasing a river that isn't flowing toward me?" If you have to force it, manipulate it, convince it, chase it—it's not your river. If it comes naturally, if there's a mutual flow, if it finds you as much as you find it—that's your river.

The mastery is knowing your ocean so well, vibrating so clearly at your frequency, that the right rivers come without you having to hunt them down.

## Q&A

### Q: This sounds passive. Am I supposed to just sit and wait for things to come to me?

No. The ocean isn't passive—it's actively, powerfully BEING the ocean. It's generating waves, holding depth, maintaining salt content, supporting ecosystems. It's vibrantly alive in its oceanness. The teaching isn't "do nothing." It's "BE so fully what you are that aligned things are drawn to you." That requires tremendous energy and clarity—just not in the direction of chasing.

### Q: What if I genuinely don't know what my vibration/purpose is?

Start with what you're NOT. What feels forced? What are you doing because you think you should, not because it's natural to you? Strip that away. What remains? Also look at what you do effortlessly that others find difficult—that's a clue to your essence. Purpose isn't something you discover in a bolt of lightning; it's something you remember by clearing away what's not you.

### Q: Can my purpose change over my lifetime?

Your essence—your vibration—doesn't change. But your understanding of it deepens, and your expression of it evolves. A nurturer might express that by raising children in one phase of life and mentoring young professionals in another. The nurturing vibration stays; the mission changes. Don't confuse the shifting of missions with a change in purpose.

### Q: What about people who have life-changing experiences that totally transform them?

Even then, if you look closely, the core vibration usually stays consistent. What changes is the clarity with which they embody it. A traumatic experience might strip away false layers and reveal the true essence more clearly. A spiritual awakening might let someone finally express what they always were but had been suppressing. The ocean is always the ocean, even if a storm reveals its depth in a way calm waters don't.

### Q: How is this different from "manifestation" teachings about attracting what you want?

Most manifestation teachings say: decide what you want, visualize it, believe it, and take action toward it. This teaching says: discover what you ARE, embody it fully, and let aligned things come to you. One is about getting. One is about being. One puts the destination first. One puts the vibration first. Both can "work," but this path is less exhausting and more authentic.

### Q: What if my ankles are actually weak or injured? Does that mean I have no sense of destiny?

Remember, the body is speaking multiple languages. Physical ankle weakness can be just physical (injury, genetics, lack of strength training). But it can ALSO be energetic. If you have chronic ankle issues despite doing physical therapy, ask the energetic question: "Do I know what I'm here to BE? Am I trying to force myself to be something I'm not?" Don't ignore physical care, but don't ignore the metaphor either.

### Q: The ocean metaphor assumes I'm big and powerful. What if I feel like a puddle, not an ocean?

Even a puddle has its purpose. It reflects the sky. It gives birds a place to drink. It waters the ground beneath it. The teaching isn't about SIZE—it's about knowing what you are and being that fully. A puddle trying to be an ocean will fail. A puddle being fully, powerfully a puddle is perfect. Know your vibration. Be your vibration. Stop pretending to be a different body of water.

### Q: What if I've been chasing destinations my whole life and I'm exhausted?

That exhaustion is the signal. The ankles are saying "stop going." This teaching is your permission to come home to yourself. Identify your vibration. Root into it. Let the constant striving GO. You don't have to keep proving, achieving, arriving. Just BE. The rivers will come. You are the ocean. The ocean doesn't chase.
