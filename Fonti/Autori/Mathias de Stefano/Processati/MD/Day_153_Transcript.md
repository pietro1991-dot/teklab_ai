## Overview

On January 3rd, we explore the Law of Vibration—the third Hermetic principle. Matias invites us to understand how everything in the universe is energy in motion, vibrating at different frequencies. What appears solid is actually waves of energy moving at specific rates.

The Law of Vibration explains why some things feel "heavy" and others feel "light"—it's about the frequency and wavelength of the energy. Lower vibrations have longer wavelengths and feel denser. Higher vibrations have shorter wavelengths and feel lighter, more subtle.

This teaching becomes practical when we realize that **consciousness itself is vibration**. Where we place our awareness determines what frequency we vibrate at. If we focus on fear, limitation, and survival, we vibrate low. If we focus on love, expansion, and service, we vibrate high. The key is not to judge low or high as "good" or "bad," but to understand that different perspectives require different vibrations.

## Core Teaching

### Everything Is Vibration

Everything in the universe is energy in movement. Nothing is still. Nothing is static.

**Everything vibrates.** From the smallest particle to the largest galaxy, everything is in constant motion, oscillating at different frequencies.

This is the third Hermetic law: **the Law of Vibration.**

### What Is Frequency?

Frequency is the measure of how fast something vibrates. It's how many cycles or waves happen in a certain amount of time.

**High frequency** means many waves in a short time. The waves are close together, short wavelength.

**Low frequency** means fewer waves in the same time. The waves are far apart, long wavelength.

### Wavelength and Perception

When you have a **long wavelength**, you have a low frequency. When you have a **short wavelength**, you have a high frequency.

Why does this matter?

Because **wavelength determines how we perceive things.** Long wavelengths feel denser, heavier, slower. Short wavelengths feel lighter, faster, more subtle.

For example:
- A rock vibrates at a low frequency with a long wavelength. It feels solid, heavy, dense.
- Light vibrates at a high frequency with a short wavelength. It feels subtle, fast, almost invisible.

But both are energy. Both are vibration. The difference is the frequency.

### Consciousness and Vibration

The same principle applies to consciousness.

**Your consciousness vibrates.** Where you place your awareness determines the frequency you vibrate at.

If you focus on fear, survival, anger, limitation—you vibrate at a lower frequency. Not "bad," just slower, denser, more contracted.

If you focus on love, joy, expansion, service—you vibrate at a higher frequency. Not "better," just faster, lighter, more expanded.

**The key is: neither is wrong. They are just different frequencies.**

### The Example of Time Perception

Matias gives a beautiful example to understand this:

Imagine you live for 900 years. When you are 20 years old, those 20 years feel very short compared to your whole life. You have so much time ahead. Everything feels slow and vast.

Now imagine you only live for 20 years total. When you are 20, that's your whole life. It feels enormous. Every year is a huge portion of your existence.

**Same 20 years. Different perspective. Different vibration.**

The person who lives 900 years has a "higher" perspective—sees a longer wavelength, more cycles. The person who lives 20 years has a "lower" perspective—sees a shorter wavelength, fewer cycles.

**Neither is wrong.** They are just experiencing life at different frequencies.

### Low Vibration Is Not Bad

This is essential to understand: **low vibration is not bad.**

In our culture, we've made "low vibration" into something negative. We say, "Oh, that person has low vibration, they're so negative."

But think about it: **a tree has low vibration.** Trees vibrate slowly. They are connected to the earth, grounded, stable, strong. They don't move fast. They grow slowly over decades, centuries.

**Are trees bad?** Of course not.

**A mountain has low vibration.** It's solid, dense, unmoving for millennia. It holds the earth together.

**Is a mountain bad?** No.

Low vibration is not negative. It's just a different frequency. It's denser, slower, more material. And **we need that.** We need the grounding. We need the stability. We need the physical.

### High Vibration Is Not Always Better

On the other hand, **high vibration is not always better.**

Yes, high vibration feels light, free, joyful, expanded. But if you are ONLY in high vibration, you can't stay grounded. You can't build. You can't manifest in the material world.

**You need both.** You need to be able to move between frequencies.

Sometimes you need to vibrate low—to ground, to build, to focus on the material, to survive.

Sometimes you need to vibrate high—to expand, to heal, to connect with the divine, to create.

### The Angelic Plane: Messengers of Frequency

The teaching for today is connected to the Angelic plane. The word "angel" comes from the Greek **"Angellos,"** which means **messenger.**

Angels are messengers of frequency. They communicate the vibration of existence beyond the ego's perception.

**Angels don't have a fixed form.** They are frequencies. They are vibrations. They can appear as light, as sound, as a feeling, as a thought.

**Why?** Because they vibrate at such a high frequency that they don't have a dense form. They are pure energy, pure message.

When you connect with the Angelic plane, you are connecting with the **power of transmission**—the ability to communicate beyond words, to transmit frequency directly.

This is the throat chakra. This is vibration. **Your words carry frequency.** Every message you speak changes the universe because it sends out a wave.

### How Vibration Works in Daily Life

Here's how to understand vibration in your daily life:

**When you wake up feeling heavy, slow, tired**—that's low vibration. You're in a long wavelength. It's not bad. Your body might need rest. Your energy might need grounding.

**When you wake up feeling light, energized, inspired**—that's high vibration. You're in a short wavelength. Your energy is expanded.

**When you interact with someone and feel drained**—you are matching their frequency. If they vibrate low (fear, anger, survival), and you try to stay high, there's a clash. Or you drop to meet them.

**When you interact with someone and feel uplifted**—you are both vibrating at a similar high frequency. There's resonance. You amplify each other.

### Changing Your Vibration

You can change your vibration consciously.

**How?**

1. **Through breath.** Fast breath raises vibration. Slow breath lowers vibration.

2. **Through focus.** Where you place your attention determines your frequency. Focus on fear = low. Focus on love = high.

3. **Through sound.** Chanting, singing, humming—these change your vibration instantly because sound IS vibration.

4. **Through movement.** Dance raises vibration. Stillness lowers vibration.

5. **Through environment.** Nature can raise or lower vibration depending on what you need. Forest = grounding (low). Mountaintop = expansion (high).

### The Universal Library

The throat chakra is connected to the Universal Library—the Akashic Records.

Why?

Because **the library is made of vibration.** Every thought, every word, every action creates a frequency that is recorded in the field.

When you access the Akashic Records, you are tuning into a specific frequency. You are matching the vibration of the information you seek.

**The library is not a place. It's a frequency.**

And the throat chakra—your voice, your words—is the key to accessing it. Because **you speak the frequency you want to access.**

### The Stair of the Universal Library

The statement for today is: **"I Am the Stair of the Universal Library."**

What does this mean?

It means **you are the bridge between the frequencies.** You are the steps that move from low vibration (matter, earth, survival) to high vibration (spirit, cosmos, expansion).

**You are the stair.** You move up and down. You don't stay in one frequency. You flow.

And as you move through the frequencies, you access different levels of the Universal Library. Different information. Different wisdom.

**The lower the frequency, the more physical the information.** How to build. How to survive. How to create in matter.

**The higher the frequency, the more spiritual the information.** How to heal. How to expand. How to connect with the divine.

**You need both.** You are the stair that connects them.

## Practice

### Preparation

1. Sit comfortably with your spine straight.
2. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

### Main Practice Steps

1. Bring your awareness to your throat chakra—the center of your neck.

2. Imagine a blue light glowing in your throat.

3. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, make a sound: **"LLe."**

4. Feel the vibration in your throat. Feel the sound waves moving through your body.

5. Repeat: **"LLe"** three times. Feel the frequency changing.

6. Now, imagine you are standing in front of a huge staircase. This staircase has infinite steps going both up and down.

7. The steps going down represent lower vibrations—grounding, earth, matter, survival.

8. The steps going up represent higher vibrations—expansion, spirit, light, cosmic consciousness.

9. You are standing in the middle. You are the bridge.

10. Take a step down. Feel yourself grounding. Feel the earth beneath you. Feel your body becoming heavier, denser. This is low vibration. It's safe. It's strong.

11. Now, take a step up. Feel yourself lightening. Feel your energy expanding. Feel yourself becoming more subtle, more open. This is high vibration. It's free. It's vast.

12. Move up and down the stairs. Notice how your energy shifts with each step.

13. Realize: **you are not stuck in one frequency. You are the movement itself.**

14. Now, stand in the center again. Repeat: **"I Am the Stair of the Universal Library."**

15. **"I Am the Stair of the Universal Library."**

16. **"I Am the Stair of the Universal Library."**

17. Feel yourself as the bridge between all frequencies. You can access any level of the library. You can move to any vibration you need.

18. Take a deep breath. Bring your awareness back to your throat.

19. Make the sound **"LLe"** one more time.

20. Feel the vibration settling into your body.

### Closing

1. Open your eyes slowly.
2. Wiggle your fingers and toes.
3. Return to the present moment.

## Integration

### Daily Exercise

**Task for Today:** Throughout the day, notice your vibration. When do you feel heavy (low vibration)? When do you feel light (high vibration)? Practice consciously shifting your frequency—use breath, sound, or movement to raise or lower your vibration as needed. Remember: neither is better. Learn to flow between them.

### Applying This Teaching

When you feel stuck in low vibration (fear, heaviness, survival mode), don't judge it. Acknowledge it: "I'm vibrating low right now. I'm grounded. This is okay." Then, if you want to shift, use your voice—hum, chant, speak a mantra. Sound changes vibration instantly. You are the stair. You can move.

## Q&A

### Q: What exactly is vibration in the Hermetic sense?

Vibration is the movement of energy. Everything that exists—matter, thoughts, emotions, light, sound—is energy oscillating at different speeds. These oscillations create waves, and the frequency (speed) of the wave determines what we experience. Slow waves = dense, heavy, material. Fast waves = light, subtle, spiritual.

### Q: Why is low vibration not bad?

Because density and grounding are essential for life. Trees, mountains, and our physical bodies all vibrate at low frequencies, and they provide stability, strength, and foundation. Without low vibration, we couldn't exist in physical form or build anything in the material world. Low vibration is simply a different state, not an inferior one.

### Q: How does consciousness relate to vibration?

Consciousness IS vibration. Where you place your attention determines what frequency you vibrate at. If you focus on fear, scarcity, and survival, your consciousness vibrates slowly (low frequency). If you focus on love, abundance, and expansion, your consciousness vibrates quickly (high frequency). You are always choosing your frequency through your focus.

### Q: What is the Angelic plane?

The Angelic plane is the level of consciousness that vibrates at such a high frequency that it doesn't hold a fixed form. "Angel" means "messenger" in Greek. Angels are frequencies that transmit information beyond words—through light, sound, feeling, or sudden knowing. They are communicators of vibration itself, showing us that every message changes the universe.

### Q: How can I change my vibration?

You can shift your frequency through: (1) **Breath**—fast breath raises, slow breath lowers; (2) **Focus**—direct your attention to what frequency you want; (3) **Sound**—chant, hum, sing to instantly change vibration; (4) **Movement**—dance to raise, stillness to lower; (5) **Environment**—nature offers both grounding (forest) and expansion (mountaintop).

### Q: What does "I Am the Stair of the Universal Library" mean?

It means you are the bridge between all frequencies. You're not stuck at one level—you move up and down, accessing different vibrations and different information. The lower stairs hold physical knowledge (survival, building, matter). The higher stairs hold spiritual knowledge (healing, expansion, cosmos). You are the movement between them.

### Q: Why is vibration connected to the throat chakra?

Because sound IS vibration in its most direct form. Your voice creates waves that change the energy around you. Every word you speak sends out a frequency. The throat chakra is the center of transmission—where inner frequency becomes outer expression. Your words have power because they carry vibration.

### Q: Can I access the Akashic Records through vibration?

Yes. The Akashic Records (Universal Library) are not a physical place—they are a field of vibration. Every thought, word, and action creates a frequency that is recorded. To access this library, you match the frequency of the information you seek. You tune in, like tuning a radio. Your voice and intention set the frequency.
