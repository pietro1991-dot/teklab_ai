don't worry
just try to process the information
you are receiving each day don't leave in the future just each day um some people are asking about
that date
do we have to wait for
time
um in the blog you have all
information it's all written
so i invite you to go to the blog
see
to read
we are going to do today is to work with the taurus
is the last aspect
will insect will integrate everything
we have worked in these past days
we are going to work today is the emotional shield the most chill is like a magnetical field
surrounds the whole body
is created by the emotions
the energy of course emotion energy is the same by the energy
is coming from each one of the motions from each one of our chakras
all them together connected is
we used to call aura
this aura uh is like the skin for our body the one protecting us from the outside
also is the one nourishing from the things
we receive from the outside
magnetical field of emotion is the one
represents kind of a like a filter allows us to perceive the information from the outside
we perceive the world through
shield of energy
is
when we receive something new in our body is first processed by the emotional level by the system of emotions
this is
one of the things
we have to do is to make our magnetical feel flexible
if we are trying to change ourselves to transform ourselves
we have to to allow ourselves to receive new perspectives to make
uh magnetical film flexible to receive new information we have to acknowledge
because our magnetical field our emotional pattern has been shaped by all the preference preconceived ideas
we have from the outer world everything
is in the outside is received by the magnetical field
the emotion translates
into patterns
those patterns within us are called beliefs these are patterns of beliefs
nothing
is in the outside is really
we expect it to be
we think
it is it is always constantly a perception of belief
structure these patterns start to create
many strong patterns creating a shield
is protecting us from the outside
is
what brings us
brings to us is
we are not flexible facing the change
what i said was
uh everything
is in the outside is just a perception by the filter of our emotional magnetical energy
translates
information into patterns
we call beliefs
when something new from the outside is trying to go within
change our perception of reality it's called like a breaking of beliefs
um it hurts
what i have to ask myself is not if
information
comes from the outside is right or is true or not if i should believe it
i have to ask myself is is if i am willing to be open to
new information
is
when we have to work with ourselves is to be flexible at the time to receive
information an important thing is if i don't believe something or i don't feel something it doesn't mean
that some something isn't true it means
my emotional feel is not ready to understand
truth
it's not resounding with me
also we can do the opposite
believe everything
comes from the outside
is
why it's
important the resonance not the belief
for example something
might be crazy
i don't believe in
i do i don't believe in anything
i do i resound with
i do
what it means to resound it means
i am constantly open to receive new information
helps me to transcend into a new level of awareness of
i do
is the way in
we can be open not only to be ourselves
also to receive new things to transform ourselves
i say i believe in
i do sometimes i'm closing myself in just my perception
i am not being able to accept new things
maybe i don't believe in
they are useful
this is
we need to understand
to use
to use the
to use the the um the emotion
if we know
to handle the emotion we
understand
to be opened to receive information otherwise the emotion is not allowing us to create is is just putting us like a rock like stretching everything someone was asking
do i know if i resound it's very impossible to say
you should resound
each one is is different the maybe the best way to understand
is to resound is to think about the tuning forks
imagine
resound or resonate comes from the word re
means to go back again to do it again
um sound of course or sonate
comes from sound
it's a tuning fork sounding
the sound comes comes to the other one okay
this one produced the sound
this one other starts to vibrate exactly the same
they are exactly the same okay at the same height
this one says
can i be vibrating
if i don't know i don't know
to do it i don't know
to make the sound
i sound
inside
this is re sounding okay is sounding again
of course if
tuning fork is very high
it sounds like another one they are unsounding i don't know the word in english
they doesn't sound well
um they are dissonant dissonant maybe uh
it means
you are not hearing well each other
usually as humans we think
this one is lying to you
this one thinks
you are wrong okay
they fight each other
they say they are mistaken online okay
what we are going to do today is
and expand
resonance of our emotional level the vibration of the day is it's like a breathing out
the statement of today is eternal life
the two ages is one the life the cycle history
the other one of course is the same
it is like a constant cycle repeating the code of today is the vibration
it says sounds the blow generated by the wind in the hole in the in the in the hole of a in a whole sorry in the hole of a jug
the water uh of life are poured uterus of creation in the black hole
will generate matter for life is the breath of the mother the matrix
