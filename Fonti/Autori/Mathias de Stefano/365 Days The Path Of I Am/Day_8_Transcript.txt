hi everyone welcome to another day of connection from
in giza egypt i hope
day finds you well
ready to do the alignment of today i hope
the text
i wrote today is helpful for you to to connect with the idea of the nice
we're going to work with today
as the people is connecting i just wanted to remind you
the energy of today with the knees is due to the information of the tree of life the family tree
made us be
we are today
the main important thing
we have to understand from today is
uh in denise the tree of life is anchored in our body
that tree is the history of our family
everything
made us be
we are today
we'll get rid of the theory of who we are
that's
we are we are the result of it
remember
the knees are related to mom
dad
each one of the knees is related with the tree of life of one of them
sometimes the problems
we have in our knees are
all of the problems
we hadn't solved in our tree of life in our family history
it is uh normal
when we get older we have much more problems in our knees
uh as closer we are to death um the weight of the tree of life starts to fall over us let's kind of read the information
quotes from today the question was if we are able to um to do more more of one alignments of each day
yes of course
we can we are just downloading the i am
it's not something um
can't
can't hurt you uh
i would recommend to make a space in between of time in between of them
you have better um processing of the information
i was saying the question was uh
one of the knees is related with mom
which one is with
the thing is
um usually the brain well usually no it's
it works the brain is divided in two
the left side controls the right side of the whole body
the the right side of the brain controls the left side of the whole body
it's not precisely like
but um
the brain is all connected
we could say
the left side is more connected to the logic
to the goals
that's
it has the energy of the father
the father is more related to the uh to the uh right side
uh the mother side is the left side
the the right side of the brain is more creative
more feminine kind of
okay boy
let's go into let's go to read the information of today
uh for all the new the new ones we remembered you
we are in the first cycle
is the first month of our year called hollac
um
is um the first month related to related to the constellation of leo from
the aspect of the i am is called icann the the vibration of the day is mu the sound mu is divided in m
represents the door the portal
you the sound you is related to the path statement of today is i am the portal to the path or to the only path
let's remember
the the knees represent the the history
it also really it is also related to the path of our own history
the code for today is contemplation in relation to the process of integration it says the universe notices everything
is able to create in its rich inner world discovering the beauty
lies within
discovers meditations the tool
shows everything in an instant
allows to watch
to be watched the instant
unifies everything
exists in all its possible aspects
it means
in the process of integration it goes within
contemplates by meditation everything
it has within
everything
every potential
the universe has in the inner part of itself
we are going to the depth
uh we are going down into the roots
is the moment to integrate every one of our ancestors
when i say to integrate i mean to observe
they accept
they are myself
they live within me
we have to be aware
in
during
alignment we can maybe feel some emotions or some memories or some uh things
made us be connected with something
we were ignoring a long time some something from our history
what we have to do is to open ourselves to accept everything
we have to accept everything
everything
happens to us everything
had happened to us is
made us be
we are
we don't have to deny anyone in
history i remind you
you don't have to be in any specific position i suggest
you position yourself in the tetrahedron position
is like meditating like the indian yogi
the most important thing is
you feel comfortable
just be aligned like
and not lying not laying down okay
someone asked about uh
if i am adopted or i adopted someone
it doesn't matter the adoption
um you exist you are
it doesn't matter if you know or you don't know your history it lives within you
uh if you know yourself you are already acknowledging something from your history
that's the most important thing also the people
adopted you is also part of your clan
the history is also by resonance
you take the information from them too
you put
history on you too
um
you were with
anyway the important thing is
you can hear me it doesn't matter if you don't see me perfectly i had a bad sign
sit comfortable begin by stretching the body caressing the body doing a tiny massage to the body we have to let the body know
this is for its higher good my young yawning discharge all the unnecessary energy of the body
start to relax the body letting the weight fall down i feel the weight of my legs relaxing my arms i let the jaw relax i start to breathe in like if i am smelling a perfume very soft i hold the air inside
exhale very soft focus only in my breathing my i feel the air the oxygen coming from my nose to my lungs going through the heart spreading with the blood towards each skin
muscle i become aware of my oxygen inside every cell of my body i hold the breathing i become fully aware of my breathing without thinking i bring my attention to the part of my body
feels more uncomfortable it feels pain or pleasure i become aware of
part of my body i breathe
part very deep i become aware of it foreign
once i have it i recognize it i bring my attention to the hottest part of my body i recognize the hottest part of my body is
all my emotions are right
so without thinking no judgments i let myself feel the emotion
right
is in
part of my body oh i take a deep breath becoming fully aware of
emotion i recognize
emotion within me
now without judgments without thinking i catch the first thought
crossed through my mind right
i recognize
thinking
it can be something silly no judgment no thinking i recognize it
breathe them very deep with my hands or my imagination i take
part of my body
emotion
this thought as if they are spheres tiny spheres of light
i bring them in my knees
without my thinking i observed them the three of them
allow myself to receive the idea of
myself my being has decided
these are the three tools
i have worked with today i watch
breathe in i recognized these three tools
with my hands
imagination i set them between my knees deep breath i recognize
in the center of my knees anchors all the history
made me be
maybe be
we
i am right
i think right
that around me i have all the people
made me be
all my family
if i don't know them i just picture the idea of them i feel my dad mom my grandparents grand grandparents
grand grand grandparents all of them connected to my knees no judgment i recognize
all of them are the roots of my own tree all of them live within me i am my tree
as the tree i am i go look the light
is over me above my head i feel the light of the i am as the sun i feel the heat in my head take a deep breath
begin to bring the light towards the roots of my tree i feel the light coming across my crown their eye throat plexus suckering root chakra slowly through the legs i feel slowly
the light starts to dissolve the three spheres
that are being absorbed by the seed in mind i recognize
these three spheres are nourishing the seed of my history
i start to resound the vibration
starts
lights the potential of
seed um i keep pronouncing the sound as i feel the network of these seed connecting the whole i feel the seed blossoming in a flower with the color of burgundy very dark diamond icon i can't transcend my history i can't be my own history i can aside fee the flower opening very wide i exist the statement of the portal i am the portal of the only path i am the portal of the path i am the portal of the path i am the portal of the path i take a deep breath
expand the flower into the network of the world filling all the path of history
how each path connects to one
each one of the flowers
are blossoming in the history network of the world all these burgundy flowers breathe in i am the portal path i recognize all the network of my history
and
softly
recognizing all the history i start to careers my knees softly bringing the energy to the ground i discharge all the statics
i come back softly touching my body stretching
yawning coming back
and
until i softly start to in my eyes everyone good anything
you are feeling maybe nauseous or dc or the charge whatever just allow yourself to feel it block anything okay
if you need to diverge the energy um just stay barefoot
walk barefoot on the ground for a bit to discharge the stat
it's normal if you are feeling weird or some feelings or sensations if we are working with heavy stuff in knees
it's kind of normal remember
we are doing
to be
and
fully aware of our of our i am
in the process of coherence
uh let everything go out we are cleaning the body okay thank you everybody for
rest a lot
see you tomorrow for defeat bye
