physical aspect of the throat chakra
is the um thyroid thyroid sorry
try to be all of us in Connection in the same line with the thyroid
um
gland is the joint of all the cells
um
is um
activates DNA of the throat chakra
this gland is the one
um has the the deepest effect in in ourselves from the moment we are in um the belly of our mothers until we stop growing up
that period of time
land helps us to develop uh helps us to to expand to find the balance between the organs
that's
it's um very important at
time
period
then
gland has the purpose the
we we stop growing up um the glands still works
um has the the to the jump of balancing the organs
it can in equilibrium we used to relate
gland to the throat chakra
land is located
in the middle of the throat
this gland is
because is the one
tries to bring the information from the hypasis bring in the information from the higher levels
the spiritual level
be download into the matter
it's kind of the bridge between these two realities
um
gland is is the one that's as a bridge in between the spiritual world
the physical world okay um
it helps to Anchor the spirit in the matter
the relation
we have in between the chakra
is about speaking talking
the physical aspect
is the development development sorry of of the of the physical aspect is
in the universe everything
is transformed it does through the vibration
Everything Changes by vibration
everything is created by vibration
the relationship with
is
the vibration the sound is the one creating the process of development of everything the development or being not only physical
also the personality is related to
I am communicating with the world
how to receive information from the world
is
this chakra is related with the process of learning
um How do I a stimulated
information
assimilation of information is the one
makes me grow as an individual
is
the the center of energy is the most important
we are talking about
to know myself
to learn
I am
we are talking about
um the thyroid
gland
um the job
this client has is to help the growth to help the development
to handle the energy of our body to expand to grow
all
energy
we have in
land can be either with very fast or either accumulated
repressed in inside of us uh stocks one of the things
we need to understand from
gland is
this gland channels the energy
comes to the body
uses use
energy to create more energy
to do stuff um or it stalks the energy
when you are a person
starts to to use
energy um uh thinking in the future constantly going going outside of you
you waste all
energy
you want to do many things
is one of the worst things
we have in our present days
is the male energy
this male energy is try trying to reach
many things
starts to waste
much energy
cannot handle all
energy
it loses energy constantly
and um
uh discrete nervous system um uh creates uh stress
we used to call
a hypertheridism um theoretism
the gland is went faster
the other way is
um
is normally in the feminine energy more aligned with the feminine um usually we have um the feminine aspect like tries to hold
energy
repress
energy inside
um
means
um heavy like your weight
you go into depression you go into status um you get frustrated you get sad you get all these emotions
also you start to grow like getting fatter
this is hypothesia theoretism um the hypotherism he put theoretism more the feminine aspect relating in
as
men
women we're more calling
feminine
masculine
this is something
goes through the whole history of humanity
is these characters related with the truth the truth
you say
is someone going over the truth of other ones
those other ones shut up the truth
they don't share it
they'll like they are below
usually
process of putting
energy over the other one makes us to most of the people say these common sentences
are uh I better don't say anything uh it's better if I shut up yes I will repress
emotion I won't share
because
is
usually um since we were born we face
situation with um the societies
the family says to us shut up don't don't we don't want to hear your opinion just sit
listen uh in silence
all these sentences
kind of makes us shut up
not to share our truth
we can say
this was something
that in history has been made with the men over the women the white race over the other races the adults with the kids as we spoke some days
this is not just ours from our own life
is stuff
has been happening in all the generations
us
we have it in adults Within
now the things have changed
now we can speak any of these things
before
in our own lives for sure you have lived
you have been shut up many times or you have said better I shut up
one of the things
we have to do is to get rid of
weight
this is
is an energetical weight
if I don't make
energy free I won't be able to develop myself
then we have the other one not only those who shut up
the opposite those who speak more than they are supposed to speak like me for example
this is not just something we have to work from from one side or another
just is the both of them we have to work for
is something
we usually do sometimes too
is to pick much
we are supposed to speak like saying hey
is my truth we have spoken about
about hearing you need to learn
to listen others if you don't listen to others you're not able to listen yourself
we have to understand is
distract the truth
when I speak much
I don't listen to others I just put my truth over the others
I say
is my truth the other truth are not the truth
you're mistaken blah blah
this is my truth
you watch it in
way is
you are wasting energy you are not in balance
this both are the ones
we have to make perfect balance
what we have to in order to balance those who had been shut up need to let all the truth God
the other ones
speaks a lot needs to find the silence to get the balance
we are going to make the balance
I will give you
task to do whenever you want
is even if you are alone
if you want just Whispering very soft
try to say physically everything
was hidden within you everything every secret every every everything
you want to say to some uh some person or whatever um just say it
um don't shut up anything just say everything even if if it's someone
you cannot talk to
it's been a long time without saying anything
you had something
say it okay
one of the ads I would give to you is
please please don't go
when you are trying to whisper something follow your beautiful Consciousness
says I cannot say
because I have to be the spiritual person no it doesn't matter
your mind your spiritual consciousness it's an open
the problem is
here
you have to help your body
in order to help your body you need to let everything go away outside if you have to blame if you have to say words if you have to send somebody to help whatever just say it don't worry everything is just for you okay just say is for your body some of you maybe would say you don't have void or whatever if you don't have the thyroid is the
your chakra has been translated uh transmitted to another organ uh maybe the chords or or whatever Inside Yes or any part
just have in mind
the work is harder
now you not only need to let the energy go out
also to advise
the chakra is empowered in a new location okay in a new position inside your throat okay
you need to visualize it perfectly in other organ like the chords for example
is the opposite
they speak a lot
they say everything
doesn't have the uh
to say yes you have to practice the opposite like go into silence
just try to think about other people
you have maybe some problems um
you were like putting your voice over them
just try to hear to listen in your mind
they said
how it affected to you not thinking about anything
it affected to you uh sometimes most of the things
we have inside are not ours they are from other people
um
they were not able to to say it uh
now we have the opportunity to set them free we have to understand
what we have inside stock is energy
words are energy from the unconscious way
we have is a way to express the energy pushing
energy towards others like I say something
I don't like
I say it against someone
I picture
person
I send
energy
I'm speaking about
other person
it's like a narrow
I just sent to
other person
we believe the problem was with the other person
the reason is
we have account inside ourselves okay the energy is within us
through the consciousness I can also say the same thing
realizing
this energy is mine is not for others
I just split
energy like
you do like
but instead of pins knot It's Just Energy okay just leave it away okay of course
are many many uh things
um
uh many illnesses
many conflicts in our throat for example
we may uh um want to understand
but each one of them
are
many
each one of them are different according to the history of
person
it's impossible to talk about all of them
they are maybe not from
time also from another time
I was speaking about myself
also
I
I had
I am coughing constantly I spoke about
uh
it's
I had a hard problem of love not not the heart attack a hard um uh someone broke my heart
uh
because of
um
were
many things
I wanted to say
and good things
that that's
I am working
