. . . just to Suzanari Aumahae.

. . . Good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you.

So we are in the middle of the desert today and we are doing a closure. So I wanted to share with you today a little bit of what we are doing here. So you can be seated here with us around the fire. Good morning , good morning , good morning.

Good morning , good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning.

Good morning , good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning , good morning.

Good morning , good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning , good morning , good morning. Good morning , good morning , good morning , Good morning , good morning. We decided to come.

So I just wanted to thank you all because all of you were very important also in this week. It has been a very deep and heavy week. But it was amazing with a lot of transformation and the standards of many things. Once , of course , everything that we have done here , it would n't have been possible with all your support from everywhere.

So the twin soul is something that is very present in our daily life because we have been basically pushed by our cultures to look for something that could complete the part that we miss that we do n't have. It 's something that is not only philosophical or cultural is something that is also in the biology , something that pushes to look for something that helps us to , or someone that helps us to transcend , to go beyond. And so this is something that historically has a condition of all constantly. There 's a lot of camels transit.

Not so traffic. Of course , that the idea of the twin soul has pushed us to evolve , to move forward , to look for much more things about ourselves , to find new people , to grow in the relationships with others. So this has been something really useful in our process of evolution , of course. But eventually comes the moment in which the seek for someone for something can take us to recognize that we were not paying attention to the real one that we have to pay attention to , which is ourselves.

So we 're seek for someone else. We recognize that we are all one. That we can connect with many. And it 's not that someone specifically has that other thing that we expect for.

But it helps us to remember that we are all part of something. It 's not someone else exactly that can give us what we are in lack of. It 's basically that all of us can share something to complete the search. So I was just saying that when I was 11 years old , I remember someone that I was in love with 12,000 years , 12,000 years , and when I would meet that person , I remember that person as my team soul.

And suddenly when I met him , it was not. So eventually when you find that person , that other person , you realize that it 's not your team soul. It was just someone that helped you reach a point in which you understand that there is no one that can complete you. There is no team soul.

There is only people that help you to move forward to recognize this other part that you could n't see from you , because when you feel love for someone , you are the one feeling the love. It 's not the other one provoking the love. It 's just yourself feeling that. So eventually you realized that it was your emotion and your mind , the ones feeling that.

So your twin soul basically is your emotion and your mind. And when you connect your mind and your emotion , you will find your twin soul within you. Yes , the perfect balance is equilibrium harmony. So that 's why I wanted to share this with all of you and to thank the person that helped me recognize that.

And thank you , everyone , for being here and a CC. This is not the environment to guide a meditation right now. But I want to let you know that I would recommend you to do that and to remind me today with your eyes open , watching straight to your eyes in a mirror. And to fully love with yourself.
