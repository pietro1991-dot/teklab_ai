hi everyone 
good morning 
good afternoon good evening 
so the topic for today is 
stream 
[Music] 
which is 
those streams of 
water 
that the 
that are born in the mountains in the 
top of the mountains and 
the caves 
going down to 
the valleys to create the rivers 
basically is the water that emerges from 
the fall 
of 
the rain 
beyond the 
the meaning 
of stream which is a flow of water 
in spanish the word string which is a 
rojo 
has a very deeper concept which is 
the action 
of 
cleaning 
the soil 
the mud 
and all the stones 
in a stream of water 
to clean 
and find the gold 
and the concept of this 
is 
that basically we are 
the cleaning of this mod of this 
soil is 
a resignification 
of the things that are 
dirty for us 
and 
that we need to 
have until we see the gold 
to resignify 
basically means 
to put 
a new direction or a new 
purpose 
on something that 
we already thought it had won 
and all this year is like a huge 
signification 
i was saying today that 
it seems like if each one of us 
it's 
his own 
stream 
trying to clean the mud 
to find the shiny gold 
trying to find 
the river 
and actually 
we will be our whole life 
doing this 
this 
process that we call re-signify 
and the way we can re-signify something 
is basically by 
taking that idea and trying to think 
about 
trying to think about 
the context in which we started to have 
that idea or that thing 
and then try to think about it 
in the new context which is today 
trying to 
think if that idea that we 
have from something 
[Music] 
is useful 
in the new context today 
every time that our context changed 
where we see 
our perspective of it will also change 
[Music] 
this is why we have always to re-signify 
things 
even if 
we are attached to this 
and i am 
signifying 
today is our day 
three hundred 
thirty three 
three 
three three 
is the nine 
the code 
of this 
i i thought that 
the day 333 would be 
a celebration 
but this is the 
the second 
time in this week that 
333 
tells me that 
is not 
that 
i am not ready 
i'm sorry it has been in 333 days and i 
have the same problem 
it's like i 
i feel like that's not a good example 
because 
i 
it's like if anything that i could say 
really 
worth 
because i'm not doing it
