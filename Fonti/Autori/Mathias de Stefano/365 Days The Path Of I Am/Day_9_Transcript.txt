hi everyone good evening good morning good night welcome to
the last um of
week related to the mind
is related to the ankles ankles ankle to they are not good in english sorry
i've been reading some comments
saying
it was kind of difficult to understand the chat between i
um today in the blog i don't know i don't know exactly
part was more difficult
i guess i kind of understand
part could be
i will try to make a summary of
so we're all in the same page
related with the ankles
the feet um is the information of our
we go the destiny we choose
what are we heading to
it implies the destiny
we are trying to go to
what um
the chat was explaining was
we think
we start a point in an origin point
then we go into uh another point like a destiny um
we think
we are going in
direction
going far farther
the system is like it closed
it's like a pattern
where it says wherever you go you will come back constantly to the same as it all closed as a circuit
this means
that doesn't matter you go you are always coming back to the origin it means
the goal is not to accomplish our purposes
to understand the map the system
all my purpose can be accomplished
when i recognize
all
that i am taking they all come back to me
i understand the whole map um i have a problem today
the people
i have above um they are screaming a lot
and playing a lot of music very loud
uh i cannot concentrate i don't know if you are listening to it
try to fix it um i'm glad if you are not listening to
because i do
the the goal of
we have today is to recognize
the path always come back to me we are going to read the information of today
let's remember
we are still in the first month related to the consolation of leo
uh it has the expression of the i am in um um expressed like i can
and we are still in the first week
is related to the mind
uh the vibration of the day is mu
is related with the sound m
that means we're talking
the sound you
means uh the the death it means also those who are born it means the the essence of the things
goes into the deepest part of the self okay
that's the vibration we are going to use today me it's not mu it's me
the statement of today is on the portal to the depth
we are going into the depth of the world the code of the day is exhalation related to the process of integration
it says the universe recognizes them recognizes
that everything has some meaning
starts to give it to understand the purpose of everything
was created
lived reaching the epiphany of the highest sense of reality
it finds coherence in all things it understands everything part of the past
that everything
passed
that ever from the past uh is
shapes being
this is related to
we were yesterday
means to bring coherence
bring um the idea the concept of
the meaning of
everything
i have within happens
i am like
i am
this is the concept
we have as information for today
that i am more uh more clear one say
the difficult part maybe to understand is the system the map
we create in our path
it is a tetrahedron the shape of a tetrahedron of course is one triangle in the base
then from each line is another triangle
four triangles three up one below
it creates four trinities
these four trinities uh for sure three um three times four is 12 okay
we are 12 beings 18 different perspectives
the the tetrahedron uh six lines six just in the geometry
these edges means the path the paths
the self must take in order to create these parts
it will have to walk 12 to the outside 12 to the inside coming out
coming back origin
it is like 24 um 24 aspects
all these aspects of the self of the being must be integrated um
for example related to the sng is like if you go into uh into one of the points of the dots
you have to experience every one of the spots
perspectives from your vision
then you have to go to another one
you integrate all the rest from your new
that takes approximately 144 lives on earth to do
do it in more or you can do it in less lives
it's more job of course no rush today we can go deeper into
issue okay
now we are going to the alignment we are going to do today is to connect with all the path of the earth every path of earth in our feet
we are going to the most depth of the world one of the things
we have to be aware of
is
culturally is the one
we used to relate with the hell
it's the one
relates ourselves with the core the fire core of earth
one of the things
we have to do first is to clean our mind in the idea
the negative the hell
all the bad things are below in the underground
we have to acknowledge
the sphere
earth is the core is
is the center
connects every one of our path
our feet is the closest spot
chakra related to the core of the of the earth
this is one of the ways in
uh religion culture um used to separate us from the earth
the core making us believe
below our feet it was the hell we are going to connect with the core of the world
every one of the path
take towards the center
as always we are going to sit comfortable setting the music start to be seated sit like
um with our heads up no laying down
let's remember to um to all of us to be clear with for all the new people
what we are doing is just to look for the coherence of each part of our body of our self nothing else some way we should not be be laying down is
we are not channeling the telerik information we are channeling eye towards the core of the world
