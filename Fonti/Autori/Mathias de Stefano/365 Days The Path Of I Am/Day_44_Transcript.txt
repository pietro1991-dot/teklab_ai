hi everyone good morning good evening good night
do you hear me do you see me
welcome another day
today in the emotional week related to the heart chakra if you see it bad it doesn't matter it's better if you see bad
that way you don't see my entire face
i remind you
the information
i'm going to talk about today is related to the things
i wrote today in the blog
is about feel
first of all let's try to understand the differences between emotion
feeling
are in such a way uh different
coming from the same thing
first of all let's remember
um emotion is a reaction it's a chemical
electrical reaction within myself
was imposed by um by something from the outside
for example um an emotion could be to um joy or to be happy
one would be in english to be happy i guess um
for example something
is funny
something makes me laugh
something makes me feel joy in
moment okay joy is not something
you feel constantly okay it's just a reaction of something
is happening outside
makes me joy
makes me feel joy
different is to be happy
this means
i achieved to feel the happiness through my life let's try to say
in english
to make the difference between emotion
uh feeling in english you say it exactly the same in spanish is different
i will try to to to to try to explain it
um we have two different ways to express with the verb to be okay with the verb to be has two different meanings one is to be
in
moment
is kind of like stay okay
it's like um you have the i am to express
stain in one sense part okay like
and
i am doing
i am doing
okay is the concept of being doing something or staying in one place okay
in the other on the other hand you have the uh to be
is to be you like i am i am
i am
okay to express
i am
the other one is to express
i am doing in a constant moment okay
these are the two aspects of to be the emotions would be those moments
you say to be
just in one specific time
specific space like i am enjoying it for example
would be the the explanation for joy enjoy yes i am enjoying
and the other one would be i am joyful okay just to make the comparison
is the two ways of understanding the to be okay i am being
and to be okay
i am um i am enjoying
and i am joyful okay these are the differences between
we would say an emotion is experiencing something in a specific moment
space
the other one refers to
you are okay
makes you be that's the feeling the thing is
to understand better
is a feeling we have to recognize
uh an emotion is the reaction of something
happened outside okay
it's just a reaction of a consequence there's a consequence a as a consequence of a cause okay
comes from the outside
what is the feeling a feeling is the result of one of those emotions repeating constantly through your life
it's
rep it has been repeated
many times
you made
emotion as something is is yours like if it it's really a part of you okay
now as the emotion is something
something from the outside had caused as a reaction within me the feeling would be something
i inherit
i accepted as mine
of the repetition
it means
from within it will create a reaction towards the outside
we would say
an emotion is a reaction from an outer impulse
a feeling is the reaction of an inside impulse inner impulse
let's remember
that a feeling is just the assimilation of an emotion
has been repeated many times we would say
the feeling is an evolutionary tool is something
i took from the outside
made it my own
now i have it as a tool as as a own tool of my own personality to develop better ways of my own self
this is
basically feelings are an aspect
define
we act in our lives
basically at the same way our eyes has been proof
mistakes once
again through all the history of evolution
we could see
we see
so feelings has been the proof
mistakes of
many emotions
we have felt through history
now we use it to feel
we perceive the world
we could say
the feelings are also a filter
allows us to perceive the reality around us
as we have said
that the beliefs are ideas
were built in order to understand the world around me
feelings are emotions
will
were built inside of me to feel
perceive the world around me
this is also the feelings a tool to help us understand
we filter the perception
we have from the world
how the world perceives ourselves
this is also
uh is
difficult for a human for individual to perceive the truth the neutral truth around us
is
as the same way our eyes has been designed to perceive a specific amount of frequencies inside a whole vibration our fillings were designed to perceive a specific amount of frequency inside
same vibration
we could say
the same frame
our eyes can see of the reality is the same frame
our heart can perceive of the reality
we have to acknowledge
if we
know
what we see is just one aspect of the whole reality
what we feel is also just one aspect of the whole reality
this is
what we see
where we feel is limited
this is
when
is
we enter in conflict
we start to perceive the world
we say no
thing is bad or i don't believe in
because it does i don't feel it or
thing is bad or i think
is good i feel
this is good
this means
we are limited by the frame of frequency
we are allowed to feel to perceive let's remin let's remember
we spoke about
person
vibrates in 700 approximately 700 hertz
this person is seen watching
universe all in color red
that's the hurts
you need to see the red color
you see all red
this person can see all the reality red
if i change the frequency in
vibration
i'm going to see is the color orange
the yellow
this is
we call parallel realities
for example the person
vibrates in red
this is a lower vibration than the other ones
it will feel more anger
this is
also we can relate the chakras
the colors with some emotions
depending on the on the vibration on the frequency i will see a color
i will also relate
with a filling or an emotion
we start to divide the reality in different frames
different aspects
what are we doing just to perceive
interpret the universe from the vibration
the frequency i am vibrating myself
inside
universe we have thousands of perspectives
thousands of vibrations
i realize myself
even if i am just perceiving the universe from my color
feeling it through my emotion suddenly i recognize
there is much more
is too much more
i start to do is just to realize
this was just my perception of a reality
is bigger than my perception
i become conscious i open my mind
i become conscious
to be conscious is not to go outside my own frequency
vibration to be conscious is to realize
even if i have my own perception of the reality
are billions of them
i can accept all of them suddenly i realize
the vibration
i am perceiving is just part of the same way the same wave
connects us all
one of the things
this helps us to understand is
is unconditional love
this vibration
why
vibration would help us to understand unconditional love
love means eternity
let's remind let's remember
the the special the
concept of love we call
ether
the time concept of love we call eternal space
time of love ether
eternal they come from the same word
this means
everything
exists is created by is created by um ether
also is eternal
is
this all vibration
connects us all
connects everything we call it the eternity
the ethereal reality the the ethereal vibration
what is unconditional love to realize
everything
exists is eternal
one only thing
transforms itself constantly
that has thousands of perspectives
is
we used to say
love is infinite
love is the base of everything
for me is is working um perfect
so i don't know maybe
you hear me better
when we are talking about feeling
feeling love
it really means is to open yourself to realize
your perception
your feeling is just a tiny part of the whole thing
exist
that's unconditional love
before i can love unconditionally the whole thing
should i do basically to accept
tiny part
i can perceive the thing is
i cannot love the whole if i am not being able to love
tiny part
is mine
this is
we have to make ourselves these questions
are the feelings
the world believe in me
what are the feelings
i used to perceive the world
look at
that i am not talking about
to vibrate higher
to be more aware
to become conscious
to rise my vibration to be something different
everything
we usually try to do by saying
is to escape
we are
picture
example water
water wants to become gas from the liquid to gas or from solid to liquid it doesn't separate from the other reality
just go away to favor it higher it just recognizes its own shape
transforms itself into a different thing
basically we have to acknowledge
everything
exists
myself is just an expression of everything
i cannot go away into another different reality by going in a higher vibration or lower vibration
yourself you are all of those vibrations
before you can change into another one you have to acknowledge
you are
how are you let's make
human example let's picture
we are in a building with seven floors you start to hear in
building the gossip the rumors
in the seventh floor
is someone called god
and it's amazing to be in the seventh floor it's like the best
sometimes uh
rumors starts to be haired
sometimes you you you would hear
um in the seventh floor everything is amazing like wonderful
other other one
says to you
someone told me
there was a guy
came from the seventh
he came back like like a christ
everyone would would say oh my god i want to be part of the seventh i the seventh would be amazing
what is the question
you have to do to yourself to make yourself in order to reach the seventh it's very easy the the question
i have to make myself the first question
i have to make to myself is in
floor am i
of course it's not the same to say to say uh i am in the sixth floor or in the first floor or even worst in the basement in the parking zone
the next question
i have to make myself is
am i doing in
floor
why
is my job in
floor
the question would be
that uh
is the people around me who are them um
am i doing with them
then i have to make my question
i want to go to the seventh
of the rumors or
i'm not feeling fine
i am
basically
i leave i have to acknowledge okay i had a job
so
i have to do is to try to figure out who around me are the most is the most qualified person to do my job
i leave
um i need to prepare
person
to of course become a master for
person
i have to leave i have to look into my desk
to see
is my mess
i cannot leave the desk just by
um just by saying bye
here's my problem no i have to solve my problems everything
i
i hadn't solved
so he could keep going with the with the work
i leave
i have to solve my own problems
that i am being able to solve all my problems in my desk to teach to
other person
will replace my my my spot
i can go to the main hall
to ask somebody
goes
hey
do i get to the seventh floor
there is a guide at the hall
tells me
are two ways you can reach the seventh floor by the lift the elevator or the stairs
of course
i would say is i want to go to the seventh fast like
the elevator
the guy tells you
way
you go to the lift with a belief
the seventh is great
with another belief
there i will feel myself
good
i go to the lift
i start to ascend
i go from one dimension to the other like fast really fast
you reach the seventh floor suddenly the doors are open
there is a lot of light you cannot see anything it's too bright
suddenly you see the shape of
man
person whoever
that gives you a lot of books
stuff
and he put
in your arms
says to you oh you are the new one really
i need you to bring
to the basement is
happened to the new ones
there straight to the hell
you go too fast nobody knows you you are the new one
what do i have to do to go
i have to prepare to make my contacts to meet the people to make the way into
place i have to also live away my expectations
this is
happened to everyone
too fast see
this is
we have to go step by step perceiving everything
we see accepting everything
we are
the way you can go in another level is by being the best in your own level
when you get as the best in your own floor
happened is
the other ones see
you handle your own reality
they come to you
they say hey we saw
you did really amazing
why did you come with us you will have a place
is a very basic
capitalistic way of seeing the universe
humans understand it better
the the joke of the universe is
when you reach the seventh floor it was yourself being the ruler of everything sitting
in the chair saying hi
anyway
that's the
the universe is
all
explanation is for you to understand the importance of goals step by step the goal of all
is to try to help us understand
the first thing
we have to do is to acknowledge in
floor we are
is the space
i
i occupied in
spot
floor
then once i do
i have to become the best in
i do in
floor
let's remember
feeling is to the heart
belief is for the mind it's just a perception
is the perception the tool
helps me to accomplish my reality my mission
and
so i remind you the task the question of the task for today
the question would be
are the feelings
define myself in the world
that would be
the world is perceiving me through my feelings
how i perceive the world through my feelings
let's do the meditation
the vibration we are going to use today is fee it's not phi is fee the code for today is the pattern law the verb becomes the singing of the cosmic mother
nerd
nurtures her children in the warmth of her breasts feeding them from heaven with the elixir of life the divine nourishment love the law sound is the vibration
expands the heart of the mother
speaks out
that speaks about the creator
nurtures the children of the cosmos in all the kingdoms
elements of creation
the statement for today is i am the spark of the soul is it comfortable i give thanks to the body for being the expression of the spirit in the matter i start to focus in my breathing as i relax the body aside take deep breath with my imagination i go with the oxygen through my nose towards the lungs the heart blood organs
muscles i allow myself to feel the heat within my body
how
heat goes through my skin expanding all around towards all the directions moving the waves of a big ocean around me i find myself floating inside
big ocean of vibration
energy i allow i allow myself to feel
the waves around move my body very soft to one side

start to go up feeling
your head is going over the water with each breath you feel the water going down to your forehead eyebrows eyes
ears you feel the nose outside

going down letting all your neck outside
feeling
the water is going down by your shoulders your back
chest you feel it around your arms below your shoulders letting the nipples over the water filling the rest of the body below the sea take a deep breath
recognize
every wave is an emotion
that all the waves around complete your feelings
