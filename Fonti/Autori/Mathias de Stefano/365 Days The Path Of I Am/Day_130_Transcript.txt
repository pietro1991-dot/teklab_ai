hi everyone good morning good afternoon 
good evening everyone 
and sorry that I posted the in the blog 
really late I just did but uh it's just 
that I wasn't able because of all 
activities for today so 
I wrote it an hour ago 
so the topic for today is expansion 
and I will try not to expand too much 
uh because I uh to be 
um sincere uh I'm really tired 
and so and tomorrow we start again very 
early 
so first of all I 
um we start with this 
um I would like to 
to talk about a message that we received 
today in the pyramid that is related uh 
somehow with the topic for today and I 
wrote it in the blog too 
I don't know if I explained you this 
um but um the information 
um that I'm going to share now is 
um related to the three kings of the 
story uh remember that we are close to 
to them 
December 21st uh to the December 31st 
that 
um 
uh that is the the Bethlehem star in the 
conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn 
and 
um this uh this conjunction 
um 
tell us about the story 
of three kings that were astronomers 
that could see this conjunction and they 
knew that the king of Earth was about to 
be born 
so this is not a Christian story is uh 
very much older 
um and is related to this conjunction of 
Jupiter and Saturn 
but followed by three kings that are the 
three stars of Orion's belt 
so as we spoke for sure someday 
um the three Pyramids of Giza are 
related to the three stars so the three 
kings 
the Three Kingdoms of the spirit the 
soul and the body 
so today in the pyramid when we were 
doing our task where we were supposed to 
do there was one being that came and 
said 
I am from the king from the kingdom of 
the body 
and this is my gift for you 
my gift is the mirror 
but he did a 
a game with the words 
saying that it was the mirror the the 
mirror where you look at you at yourself 
but 
he said it in a way that was the mirror 
so the elements of one of the three 
gifts of the three kings 
so 
um that makes me that made me understand 
uh 
of 
um 
of this gift of the of the three kings 
so now I'm going to explain why the 
mirror 
what he explained is somehow not like I 
am going to explain now but 
very symbolically uh he said that uh the 
mirror is like a how do you say racina 
resin 
um it's like it's like a resin 
um 
uh that represents the spiritual word 
manifested in the material world in the 
physical world 
and so 
this represents that the first gift is 
not the element the resting exactly 
but the concept of how the spiritual 
becomes into the uh into the physical 
by the mirror mirroring the 
the the subtle levels to the density 
levels 
the message of the mirror the gift of 
the mirror was that 
everything the universe is mirroring 
itself it's a constant expansion 
expression of of 
um a reflection of oneself so 
when we are looking into the future 
instead 
um by reflection the the one we are 
looking in the future is also looking to 
its own future 
so in order to receive the messages of 
the future that we want to receive the 
ideas 
we have to turn back to our past and to 
see our kid from the past 
straight into its eyes and to 
tell to that kid 
all the wisdom that we have accomplished 
through life sharing our ideas our 
emotions our thoughts our growth with 
that kid in the past so 
as we do that 
our 
self of the future will also very 
reflection turned to us look into our 
eyes and tell us about everything that 
he learned he she learned and 
um 
and we will receive some information 
from the future 
so by the law of reflection the way to 
speak with the future 
is by looking into our eyes from the 
past 
so that was the gift that this being 
gave us saying this is the mirror this 
is the mirror 
this is to look to yourself 
so the law the the expansion that we 
have to speak about today 
um 
is related to the mirror when we say 
that 
um uh the universe which is the inside 
projected into the outside and it see 
its own image reflected so by looking 
that image we can see different 
perspective of ourselves so we start to 
look for more different dimensions of 
ourselves to see specifically 
um different 
perspective perceptions dimensions of 
our 
of our reality 
the universe by this mirror 
is watching itself 
and then this this same mirror starts to 
divide by fractalization and starts to 
divide once and again and again and 
again creating this 
fractals of the only reality the oneself 
and 
it expands into the infinite 
constantly 
this shows us that the universe is a 
being that is constantly looking for new 
possibilities of itself 
is seeking to learn as much as possible 
from its own being 
so the thing is that as much the 
universe is looking straight into 
something looking for the for all the 
dimensions and aspects from that from 
that being from that other projection 
the most uh faces it see from that thing 
so suddenly you realize that each one of 
the particles of this of the beings that 
exist in the universe creates its own 
mirrors its own 
um their own 
projections and fertilizations 
so it starts to be Eternal starts to be 
spread 
eternally 
so basically as closer I get to get to 
understand something 
The Closer I Get To Think 
what that can become 
if I look it in a different way 
so this is why the universe starts to 
to project itself 
in many other shapes and so keep going 
and keep going until it just expands 
towards the infinite 
and it expands in two kinds of infinite 
the infinite of time and the infinite of 
space 
so uh what we call the expansion of time 
would be kind of the branches of the 
Tree of Life in the universe 
and what we call expansion of space is 
the expansion of the roots of the Tree 
of Life 
but it doesn't matter if root or 
branches is just a concept 
and the reason why I say the tree of 
life is because for all cultures the way 
to explain this expansion of the 
universe is through a tree because they 
see that from Unity it divides into 
Duality and from there in four in eight 
and so on once and again once and again 
and the shape of it is kind of a dream 
in this fractalization of this tree in 
this expansion makes that all the things 
that are going up like the branches 
starts to go down to because of this 
ramification and then the roots also 
they start to go up because they start 
to divide and and open okay so someday 
the roots and the branches will match 
and touch each other 
this so this is the shape of the Taurus 
discrete the Taurus 
so this is how 
time and space are connected so the 
transmission and information between all 
times and spaces are start to 
to connect start to to to manifest 
when we describe the Taurus you will see 
that this shape is not growing like this 
expanding itself it's growing like this 
replicating itself once and again 
we have to understand that the Taurus is 
this shape that is not expanding towards 
a direction in the universe but it is 
this fractalization of itself 
that moves 
once and again replicating its own shape 
and nourishing from absorbing itself and 
expanding itself absorbing and so it 
goes to the outside and goes back to the 
origin and the origin itself is part of 
that fractalization 
so this is why the Taurus this tree of 
life is an example of the constant 
expansion of the universe 
this is why the universe is expanding 
itself through recycling itself 
so this is why every time that we are 
looking to go back to the core of the 
of the universe to the center to the 
origin what we are promoting is to 
expand even more the universe 
so expansion is not how far the Stars 
can spread in the universe 
the expansion is about how many times 
and how many dimensions 
can we project our visions 
of those Stars 
so by the expansion the universe is just 
trying to tell us that we also live in 
expansion and that we are also trying to 
create our own Universe by expansion 
so today in the day of um 
thought of the Taurus of the toroid 
um 
our goal is to work exactly with that 
expansion 
I told you I was going to speak less 
see 
if you want to have something more 
there's the blog 
Liberation for today is 
[Music] 
the statement for today is I am the 
dimension of Eternity 
the code for today is the I Cosa 
dodecahedron 
the combination of the icosahedron and 
the dodecahedron generates the 
communication force between Heaven and 
the depth 
between air and water 
Mountain and Valley high and low 
its faces are the sum of the two 
mentioned figures a total of 32 
with 12 pentagonal and pentagonals and 
20 triangulars 
60 edges and 30 vertices 
this interaction between both 
complementary poles 
make it the base pattern that will 
originate the throat chakra 
so with this alignment today we close 
the mental weak 
of Sagittarius 
that's it comfortable 
move your body to 
to stretch 
to relax it as we start to focus 
in our breathing 
I remember 
that I am a seed 
inside the Earth 
absorbing the nutrients 
to spread my roots 
and my leaves above 
I feel the roots going deep and deep 
as my leaves 
go up 
in between the forest and the animals 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
I expand 
growing up 
aside the Tree of Life 
[Music] 
as 
I reached the branches and the leaves 
searching for the light 
with every breath 
with my hands 
I accompany the flowering 
as I reach 
the air 
over the tree 
looking into the forest from above 
and the Savannah 
take a deep breath 
expanding even more 
being able to observe the entire Forest 
the entire Savannah 
the coast 
[Music] 
the sea 
in the horizon 
as I expand I reach the skies 
feeling Delight 
the yellow light of the Sun 
the white light from the clouds 
in the light blue from the sky 
take a deep breath 
and allow your flower to open wider 
as you reach the atmosphere 
getting out of it 
reaching the outer space 
and realizing that the light that you 
are searching for 
is now in the surface 
of the Earth 
and I can see 
Africa 
below me 
Europe Middle East and Asia 
and 
as I expand and move around the world 
I can see the Americas 
the Pacific Ocean 
IA 
an Antarctica 
take a deep breath 
and take the world between your hands 
and bring it towards you 
but this time 
you make it bigger 
as you go inside of it 
with this fear around you 
[Music] 
and your crown 
touching the North Pole 
as your feet 
touch the South Pole 
[Music] 
and from here I expand myself 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
I feel the magnetical field 
coming 
from my crown 
to the north of the planet 
going all around the sphere of the world 
like this tiger web 
coming back to me through my feet 
[Music] 
I feel the toroid 
flowing through me 
going around me 
and moving everything that is eternal 
Within Me 
and I recognize 
this expansion this eternity 
with my sound 
[Music] 
connecting all the dimensions 
[Music] 
foreign 
[Music] 
foreign 
Ty 
I am the dimension of Eternity 
I am the dimension of Eternity 
I see the eternity 
[Music] 
I see I see I see 
Kitty breath 
a cyber scene 
all the times and spaces to me 
[Music] 
for I Am The Eternity 
[Music] 
like expansion 
I am the expansion 
foreign 
[Music]

and softly I start to bring all this 
Consciousness throughout my body 
caressing 
stretching and yawning 
and slowly each one at its own Time come 
back here and now 
um so 
today closing with this 
Taurus day 
um 
the energy that came with 
the Weaver 
The Spider and she doesn't speak 
any language 
only 
networks so for whoever 
ReSound 
um 
she shared those codes 
so 
thank you 
everybody as always for being there to 
accomplishing another week 
and 
see you tomorrow at the same time as 
always 
to begin with the emotional week 
see you tomorrow
