foreign they are having fireworks in the pyramids wow you're you're well you're missing
wow I was about to show you
I know well I cannot move um I cannot move the camera I will make a video
then I will send to okay
I I put the the video online
a fabulous way to start with the throat
I was saying
that I hope you didn't get uh very DC with all the concepts
I gave to you today
basically the thing
we are going to work with today is about the truth
lies
I know
um
month is going to be very heavy
we have to analyze many things in detail
every day
it's not necessary for you to to make it all every day exactly as I am proposing it you can you can also um do it anytime whenever you feel okay we have the whole life to work within ourselves okay there's no rush
the reason
we choose to make
in
way is
we have all
here to make it all together
to kind of try to be all in the same balance
uh don't push yourself to do something if you are not if you are not ready or you don't feel very prepared to do
Inner Path
take it slow take your time
don't worry
these videos will be recorded uh all the time
you can do it whenever you want
let's go to try to understand the concept of today
the concept of today was about the concepts of Truth
lies
in order to understand
we must know it specifically
a truth
a lie means
have
in mind first of all the truth
is a truth truth is a perception of the outer world
I have made my own okay my own
it's a perception
I can see
I am related to
so it's mine
let's try to be clear about
the truth in
universe
we know the one we know it doesn't exist
is no truth
there is no truth in
reality
always
reality will give us perspectives
the perception of those realities is those with
I feel related with we would have to understand
truth is not exactly
we think
of
what we can relate it with
I wrote today about the color red we all see the red color
we say the color exists
the red doesn't exist
we see is just the perception of our ocular the ocular nerves
receive a longitude of a wave of electromagnetism
in 680 nanometers we perceive it as red
it doesn't exist
if we put it in
way nothing
we can see really exist
everything is just a conjunction of eight of atoms everything
we see
we perceive is just the conjunction of magnetism waves photons that's it every perception
we have from the outer world will be processed by the by the system of my brain by the nervous system of my brain
if my brain is not working properly um
if it's not working properly
I will see the color in a different way like a daltonic person
what does it helps for us to understand
everything is a perception the first thing
we work
everything
we receive from the outer world is a belief it is a belief
I built an idea through
I perceive of
world
reality according to all these energies
I receive I will have one positive
one negative one
is awakened one
is a slip
are my qualities talking about the qualities imagine
picture
that in
longitude of waves if I am resounding
diverting in the 680 nanometers my reality my attribute will be red
this is
the attributes the qualities
I have are related with my vibration in
wave everyone all of us we are one
each one of us are vibrating in a different level inside
wave
this is
gives us the perception of the reality from our point of view
from the point of view of red everything
I see around will be filtered by the color red hmm
the truth
I see around me will be red
imagine
that you see everything red
suddenly someone comes
says no
is not the truth
is not the reality
you are seeing the reality is only a wave
connects us all
the red one would say yes of course whatever you want
I see everything red
can we understand
how the reality is
is
when we ask ourselves
is reality I will always I will always understand the reality through my own vibration
when I change my vibration from Red I go into Orange red Orange
help
happened
we change our vibration from Red into orange I would say oh my God the reality wasn't red the reality was orange
the Orange is your new reality
you will defend
reality
suddenly you will work harder to become yourself more
more orange
balance in the orange
suddenly you go into yellow
you see yellow
you say oh my God it was
big
it's bigger
the universe is yellow
so on we can go through thousands
billions of colors
waves until we picture
oh yeah it was a wave it was not a color
in the
you realize about the whole wave
you say yes the wave is the answer suddenly you realize
the wave can also behave itself as a particle in the quantum mechanics
suddenly you say like
it's a whole new universe parallel universe
it's like
it goes on
on
on
when we ask ourselves
is the truth the answer will will be always the truth is my point of view
all the rest is just distortions something very important to understand is
if I position myself in red I see the whole reality in red suddenly someone from the orange
someone from the magenta will come
say hey the universe is magenta
someone from the orange would say hey
is the universe is orange
I would say no neither of of you are right the reality is red the two other colors the orange
the magenta for me will be distortions of reality
to those distortions of reality we humans used to call them lies
this is
when someone from the orange Universe comes to me
says hey the universe is orange I would usually say to him no you are lying to me
is the first point
you could understand
is the truth
what is a lie okay did you follow me okay I if not you can listen it again
now we go to the other point of view of the truth
the light
is the OWN the my own the other point of view of truth is
myself being in red in the red universe I will create my own reality through the color red
everything
I will do will be read
even in some day I just realized
the universe is bigger
there's not only one red perception even though I recognize the red as my own truth okay
that's my truth the question would be are you wrong
you are saying
this is my truth
this is the truth even if you know
there is more truth no you are not wrong
you are just watching everything from
point of view
for you that's the truth
that red exists for you
it is your own reality
now picture
when you recognize
there is the red universe
suddenly you have some other people in
universe the red Universe around you
because you maybe are a threat you know
there is a bigger universe
uh there's a big universe around
you are afraid
maybe
other Universe would change the people around you
what you do is to turn to those people
say to them
is no other truth the only truth is the red universe everything is red
is nothing around there's nothing more just
so
are you doing
you're not lying for us is a lie
their universe is red yeah it's the truth
you are distortioning the truth saying
this is the only thing
exists
now I'm feeling right
between all of us
the first thing
we do is to judge others suddenly we start to say yes there's people lying to us the the church the religions the Illuminati the governments everyone is lying to us they keep us trapped in
universe
there is much more
the question we have to make ourselves if we are in the path of consciousness is did I lie to myself
that's
from doing
I do
that change we call it consciousness
we um
we start to do is to think about ourselves like am I lying to
we usually think
there are big lies
the big likes lies are made up of tiny ones the ones
we made every day
we usually do it to distort Distortion create Distortion in our own reality to adjust
reality to our own beliefs
perceptions
this is something
we all do every time always
is a way of survival it's a way in
our body says I find myself secure safe
so
I do is to um um
to say in English to cheat cheat myself it's kind of like
to cheat myself
because I am afraid of changing I'm afraid of
I'm going to become that's the key to to dissolve all the rest of the lies
this is the the thing
we have to do stop seeing
others are lying to us
recognize in
moments you lie to yourself
from
you can change the rest
is
this tracker
must understand
are its truth
which are its lies
lies are coming from my mouth
which lies are coming in
building my inner world we all have light or we lie to ourselves constantly we all lie to us constantly in such a way even in tiny things like for example long hair fits me fine it's good on me long hair a tiny line
also
are many other lies
we have built through years
we hold them
they create the basement of
we are lies are fear fear to change if I start to transform my fear to transcend my fear I don't need any more lies
lies the only thing
they do is to make a distortion in the reality to protect reality hmm maybe you will be asking me can you give me examples
there are many examples
each one of you is different
I I won't be able to say one for each that's
I usually say mine
are my truth my truth are those things
I have said
that made me be to recognize who I am
the beliefs are the things
I believe
I think about the world about
life is
Truth are those things
I say
that I admit yes I am
I am
an example of um saying my truth is like
moment of your life
you couldn't stand anymore
you just spit
say to others yes I am
the lives are those things
I say or say to myself to draw the reality
I can keep it safe Within Me
after
what we are going to do is to write down to write down yes
is
I am I am
I am
this is my truth Who I Really Are
the lies I would say yes I have lied to me in
I have lied others with
it's possible
maybe you will take even years not only days to figure out a lie
remember it's not about lies
other people put on me is about my own lies the ones
I made up the ones
I created acknowledging thinking hmm
is the thing
helps us
that helps us to understand
I can find
can I find the distortions
filters my connection from the consciousness with my heart remember always the one of yourself no the outer world
