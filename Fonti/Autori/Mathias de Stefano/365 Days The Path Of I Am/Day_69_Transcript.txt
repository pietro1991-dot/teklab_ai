hi everyone so welcome another day this time for the 
ankles related to the mind the week of the Mind in the month of Libra 
so we have only one day left to end up with the 
Mind week I felt like this week was like very very 
fast so um before we start I just wanted to tell 
all of you the those who are joining us for the first time that 
um if you have any questions any doubts or anything about what we are doing and 
so on uh you can go to the blog 
um which is Jose dot red uh just so just so it is I am in Spanish 
and red doesn't mean the color red it means Network in Spanish 
so um look for that and there you will have all information of everything that you 
you need to know to um to know what we're doing 
today when I was in the pyramid the information that was was shown was about uh meaning and 
nonsense so sense and no sense um so 
this concept um I I I wrote about this concept in the blog 
but um as always I will try to make a summary of this uh topic uh 
so we could all be in the same page while doing the alignment 
for sure you have felt through your life and maybe in this moment 
the feeling of nonsense 
that nothing have since it's like not only the spiritual things 
that we are doing every day but also our life like a job 
uh friends Life Society anything and suddenly when I go 
deeper into the uh into acknowledging the universe and how it works suddenly 
uh everything has even less meaning 
um like nothing really has a meaning 
so suddenly what we do uh is to try to 
is to think that anything we do in our life 
um is really real and that we usually 
um when we get into know the universe and we know that kind of anything really 
exists suddenly we say so what is the purpose of everything what 
why do we do what we do if nothing have really 
meaning and you feel like a void some of you maybe know this process like 
the darkness of soul maybe you have heard that that sentence that name someday before 
but the thing is that there are many moments and each one of these moments 
are different in which we kind of feel this nonsense of reality 
in these different moments one of the first ones that we may feel is the one 
that when we work in our lives and and sadly we try to do 
everything as the society is telling for us to do and to earn for some holidays 
and to try to definitely together and and to try to to be as everyone says 
that is better to be so um suddenly we stop and say wait a 
moment what is the the meaning of this what is the point of 
all this and um 
suddenly you realize that life as you was as you were living it 
has no meaning so sometimes 
we just stop living that life and we start to seek for our dreams 
to give a new meaning to our lives and trying to to give the purpose to it uh 
a different idea of what life means 
so that is the moment when I recognize myself capable to live my 
dreams or to live different realities in the world not the ones that I've been set to 
so imagine that when you achieve the limits of 
what whatever you can do in the world and and to accomplish your dreams suddenly 
the the question comes up again like the meaning of this 
what what am I doing what is the point 
so suddenly you realize that everything that we decide was just a projection 
of within so suddenly you realize that 
that meaning that everything has in the outside is the meaning that I 
give to it so if there is no meaning in the outside that means that I am not 
given a meaning that I don't have a meaning so I go Within 
I go to look for my inner aspect to 
to find a meaning Within Myself so there comes the time of spirituality 
philosophy the sick of new points new meanings 
so there is a moment when I ask myself oh now everything 
happening but because I got a meaning but suddenly you may say 
if I am the one giving the meaning so who I am 
and when you start to look for the meaning of Who You Are you start to 
fill everything like multi-dimensional beings the other lives 
everything that gives a meaning to what you are now 
all the Masters the different realities everything Beyond this what you know 
and and suddenly you give a meaning to everything because of that 
suddenly you recognize that all of that that came meaning to you 
doesn't exist and 
suddenly all of that was just a projection from yourself from 
a bigger mind that you call am 
so suddenly you realize that you see I am the Creator so you say oh yes now I 
got the new meaning is I am the Creator I am the one creating all that 
so suddenly one day I recognize that 
not even me is real because I was thinking that it's me the 
one creating believing and creating everything nothing I realized no it's 
not me there's no I am me 
because I am just another projection from a const that was I am I am is a concept 
it's not a person so suddenly you realize that you are in 
the projection from them so suddenly 
you lose them of everything everything is pointless 
and suddenly you realize that the only thing existing is a 
concept is only one thing that I call Unity 
and suddenly when I find the meaning of what is unity 
I am trying to touch unity and suddenly I find the void 
the vacuum and everything loose 
meaning so suddenly 
there is no other thing but to give a meaning to do it 
so what is the meaning of void is the capacity to create meaning 
so what is the point of all this that we have spent our entire lives trying to 
find the meaning of of things 
um but always at the moment when you find the meaning 
of something there will comes another thing 
that will erase the sense of the previous concept 
saying that it doesn't have any meaning 
so basically here comes the question 
uh so what is the meaning of all this 
why do we do all this what is the meaning 
so I'm sorry but I guess that this is the answer 
so maybe this is one of the most difficult things that a mind 
needs to process um 
in order to understand this so 
the truth is that there is no sense 
so basically the reason why there is no sense that everything is no sense 
in the reality uh 
is because senses are the basis 
of our existence through the five senses that we have 
and our five senses are trying to feed the ideas of the world 
in a specific moment and in a specific time 
let's try to make an exercise to understand this 
basically uh the brain the mind the signs the 
brain in order to be able to receive the information of the entire world on the 
outside through electrical pulses so through all the nerves in our body we 
receive the electric pulses to uh to get the information 
so basically what the senses are doing is to design like kind of a map 
of the environment we are moving in we're moving through 
so basically what the senses are by 
smell um year hearing uh saw touch and taste the 
five senses what they are doing is to um to make a interpretation of the 
environment we could create like a like a maze like 
a like uh maze in our mind 
like a map where our conscience Consciousness could go and find 
the specific points locations inside a specific time and a specific 
space so basically we have to picture like a 
invisible mind that is creating positive and negative uh pulses of 
energy that sends data information from the filling 
and by that starts to create a map where the mind could move through 
hmm so this is why to all this map of the mind 
we call the sense or the meaning 
so uh the reason why we call the sense 
is because it was brain it was part it was created by the brain 
like mapping the reality to know where you are moving through 
foreign English meaning to give a meaning to 
something comes from the world mean that comes from the world means that means 
specifically mind okay so this is why meaning is only related with the 
perception of mind what this means that all the meanings 
that we give to anything in our reality in our life 
is only based in the perceptions of the Mind of the outer world 
so this is why each human has a different 
meaning of life basically any meaning that we won't give 
to the existence will be determined 
of how we feel existence that if we are willing to find 
a more accurate meaning to everything 
what we have to do is to find how to clean and to work precisely 
to work precisely with our five senses 
so this is why it's so important the five senses since the moment we are born 
um we need to learn how to fill them how to interpret them how to 
use them before anything else we need to learn how to use prop lower five senses 
because they will determine how we fill the world 
so once we know how to handle properly the five senses of our reality 
suddenly we're to open ourselves to the senses of the fourth dimension The Fifth 
Dimension and we start to perceive more and more senses in 
different realities as more as much more senses we achieved 
from our multi-dimensional reality the best we can map the reality 
the existence but the real the reality that we cannot 
perceive the truth of the universe just by only our five senses 
so this is why we cannot determine the reality the existence the logic of 
the whole universe only through our five senses 
once your mind has mapped the reality and your costness has gone through all 
the different parts of this map you suddenly go into another level of 
consciousness you rise yourself into another perception no Dimensions but just 
perceptions of yourself and suddenly you say oh now I got the meaning of all this 
so you start a new one so when you start the new one 
subtler's census had no idea of this new reality 
so you lose the sense of everything 
because you have to start again foreign 
go into into another constant 
we have built our senses the map of our reality through the idea of hierarchies 
so the idea of hierarchy is the one that made us believe that in order to reach 
the Divine we need to go into layers of society or knowledge 
another idea that we have created through the census is that in order to 
to reach their own we have to go 
in a path towards the horizon so 
we have created this concept this idea of the universe according to 
in which in which direction which path are you 
taking in life the sense of Transit okay 
so this is why we also have this time the universe according to 
a path that goes ahead or a hierarchy that take us up 
also we have said that if our sins have been able to design 
a sense and meaning of reality through mind so the universe have done exactly 
the same the universe is a mind 
designing uh purpose 
so let's take the image of something that I wrote a few days ago did you remember that 
con the text that I put all the dots and each dot represented a Sentry and the 
few five last centuries are the ones with much movement and 
and our history of the last 500 years 
so um now take this image if we take the first moment of the first 
cell in history how many dots we would have to write 
until we reach to the century the one 
before so imagine that all our history is just 
in the last 30 dots 30 dots of thousands and billions of 
dots of centuries in the history of reality 
nothing and the last 500 years 
this idea of meaning started of meaning to everything started 
around I don't know maybe a hundred dots before 
if each dot is a sentry 
hmm so from a list of billions 
of dots representing the centuries the last 
100 dots were the ones in which we have designed 
the meaning the purpose the sense of the universe 
so what I want to say with this is that through thousands and billions of years 
everything worked and nobody asked never about meaning nobody worried 
about the meaning until now so why is important now 
why everything works so well even if nobody have said at any time 
this is the meaning of life maybe this is complex but 
um I just want to go to the last the very last dot of the list 
so what I want to say is that the Universe isn't something with meaning 
the universe is something that is creating meanings 
is the creator of meanings and it's in that moment 
when we humans appear in this corner of the 
Galaxy so we are one of those thousands of 
uh conscious intelligence species that decide 
the meaning of the universe so 
anytime that you that the question but what 
what is the meaning of this comes after this 
is well if there is no meaning I am the one that have to give meaning to to it 
remember we cannot put in the same level 
meaning with reality because 
the mean has emerged in order to understand the reality 
so there was no meaning before reality because meaning 
the senses were designed as tools to understand to 
perceive their reality so this is why when we go to the very 
beginning and origin of all the things the last thing that we will find there 
is meaning so this is why 
there's these people that can touch the origin of everything what they feel is 
void vacuum is that vacuum that allows them to give 
the meaning to everything so this is not a 
spoiler of the universe so 
I am saying all this not as a spoiler of the universe 
but as a tool for you so when you go outside 
tomorrow to the world and you say what is this 
your inner self can say I don't understand this so I will give 
it a new meaning so I hope you you got this 
and if you didn't got it if you didn't get it so it doesn't matter because 
because it has any sense so let's go to the alignment 
they're very important for today is new the statement for today is I am Destiny 
of all tests so this is referring to the test that we 
receive in the known sense each time that we feel it 
the code for today is the physical pattern ha 
says by acknowledging this Temple the body it can be analyzed 
it can be analyzed the planes unfolded and take notice of its construction 
the study analysis research make it acknowledge itself as the 
architect of its own reality being able to transform its walls Chambers altars 
according to its needs improving matter acting in the Creator conscience from 
matter is the sound of realization 
of the planification of bringing Heaven to Earth 
start to see it comfortable 
and let the weight of my body fall down

as they start to feel heavy as if the light becomes physical 
[Music] in one hand I hold the meaning 
[Music] the sense of everything 
in my life and in the other one I hold the nonsense 
the meaningless Concepts of existence [Music] 
I become aware that the meaning of life 
the sense of it is the one that I give 
[Music] to my life and in the other hand 
the known sense of my life of existence is that I have to remind myself 
that it's me the only one capable to give a meaning 
to it [Music] 
so [Music] as I take my hands to my chest in my 
heart with my sound I start to unify these two concepts as 
one Within Me [Music] 
foreign 
[Music] 
foreign 
that every test that I have gone through in my life has gave the meaning has given the 
meaning to my life and the great test 
is to go beyond the nonsense to find a new one 
take a deep breath becoming aware in the center of your body 
that on the only one capable to give the meaning 
to everything in my life 
for I am the destiny of all the tests 
I am to Destiny of all tests 
I am Destiny of all tests 
foreign [Music]

[Music]

body by caressing it stretching and yawning 
[Music] 
[Music] and I came back here and now 
softly opening my eyes [Music] 
foreign 
[Music] 
remember that the task for today is to manifest 
and in a way in a great way 
[Music] um what is the meaning and meaningless for 
us so as always
