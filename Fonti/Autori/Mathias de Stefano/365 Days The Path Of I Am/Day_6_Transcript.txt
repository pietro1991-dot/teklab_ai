today our job would be to anchor the energy of the i am into the sacrum i hope it was useful for you the chat the conversation between i
um today in the blog
it could help you to have some more information uh for the alignment of today
just to tell you
we only has been doing
for a week
i am already doing more personal job
i have ever done constantly in my life usually my process of acknowledging happens in a few hours or just one day
never
slow
day by day
i don't know
it's going to
it's been for for you uh
for me it's it's been uh intense days um i was sharing
um
i'm used to to do these um growings within
um
very intense like usually all is a cows in just one tiny moment
boom
and i learned a lot
um must tell
uh since we started
i have been feeling exactly the opposite as i always feel
a growth a process of growing up
is to be very quiet
very aligned
even happy constantly something
never happened
because i usually am changing constantly
it's good to talk about the day today energy
for those who are joining us um joining us right
uh let's remember
we are in
um year outside of time
this is the first month the first cycle
it's related to the constellation of leo
uh the mantra of
constellation the aspect of the i am of
constellation is the icon
that's
we are going to work with the whole month let's remember
each month has three weeks of 10 days each
this is the week of mind we have the weeks of the mind the emotion
the physical
the concept of the whole year would be to work with these three parts align them in coherence
to work with the alignment of the i am
we are going to do today is to download information of the i am into the sacrum chakra inside the process of the mind the vibration we are going to use to activate the potential of the i am in our sacrum today would be the sound mu the sound is always like it's not me me
it's like putting your mouth in order to say you the sound you
we say an i
ah the sound means m is the door
the sound represents the creation to just state the statement we are going to use today is i am the portal of creation remember
uh the task i put
is just uh if you are not gonna be able to do these alignments connected with all of us
take just five minutes of your day any time to do
task
the code of today is exhalation into the process of experimentation it says
reflecting about its experiences the cosmos starts to create new ones to modify them to take action with the created ones to be transformed again
time with an overcoming vision like who starts again to write a book or paint a painting
a time of reflection remaining itself the concept of
code
we are going to work with is uh
the process of contemplation of everything
that the universe created it starts to recreate again like transforming the things
it experienced into a new reality
this is
we are going to work with in the sacrum
we have already the information
