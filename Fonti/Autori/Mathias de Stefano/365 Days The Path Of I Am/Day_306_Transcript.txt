We are living Come on , Bo. Right now. The temple of the god Dubbed. The god of shadows.

And we were lying down in the temples. And I was not saying I ca n't do this on my channel yet. So we have been the whole day doing things since 4 a. m. in the morning until now 11 , 20 p. m. So we have been working a lot with the guys and the people we have been doing many things working really hard. So I must thank all the people that are here in the boat with us.

The 73 people that are here because it 's been a very tough day. We had lots of things to do many things to do. And it 's been really hard holding all the things. So today we have many things to do.

That 's why we could n't be at the same time as always. That 's why it 's difficult. Thank you to all the people here as always connected. So today has been really tough.

So I just had a very hard channeling. So I 'm really tired and I 'm not able to do what I am doing every day here. But I was to appear anyway because that we have this link that we have to do. So I just wanted to appear to tell you all of this to all of you.

So now I will try to anchor a little bit. It 's impossible to see but they are there. So now we go to anchor a little bit and remember that the coach for today the alignment according to the structure and construction. So the being that that was here today said to us that we go to see.

We got to die and let ourselves die so. So let 's see what happens. So that 's it. So thank all of you for being here.

I recommend you to do the alignment right now. If you are correct self. You have a good practice and we will be there now. Just to learn that.

Do some more. Which is the two. Thank you everyone for being here as always. It 's everyday and see you tomorrow.

At the time that we are at your reach. Tell us. So. Alright.
