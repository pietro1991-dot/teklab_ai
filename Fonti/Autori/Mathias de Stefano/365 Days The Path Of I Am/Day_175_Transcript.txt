So , hi everyone , again , this time a little bit later and well for those who were not in the live streaming today , I connected later because I was , I connected at the time that I was supposed to connect but the boat where I am , it was on slow and we did n't raise one at the time I thought we would so we were just going through a zone of knock connection , nothing in the middle of the desert and the river and so we lost the connection so that 's why I decided to make it at the moment when we arrived to , to Asian and here it is so I am right now in Asian in the south of Egypt so good morning , good afternoon , good evening to all of you from Asian Yes , that is about against another boat , Egyptian style Right now I 'm feeling like the musicians from the Titanic , Titanic I will keep speaking even if it sings Okay so today is the topic for today 's technology , technology related to the solar plexus and the physical week of the month of capital So today speaking about technology , we lost the connection because of the technology and now the boat technology is also doing its problems So first of all let 's go to understand what is technology , what is the concept of technology because for us today we think that technology is all these things like the phone , the computer and the physical things that we use , like the tools that we created but it 's not that technology does n't mean exactly the objects that we use as tools in our days , it comes from another concept , the origin of the word technology comes from the Greek , the Ne and Logos , the Ne means art , means beauty , all the things that we create is the art itself and why is that because the in the European origin of this language is the word tech , tech means tissue means to wave So tech means the web and this is when you put different things together to create a new thing from different parts so that 's what we call art to put together many things and to give birth to a new one so that 's why to wave the things to connect the things to create a new one that 's what they call it tech or technique which is the beauty of arts and then we have the other word that is Logos , Logos means the study , the development , the knowledge of something okay Techno Logos , the Ne Logos means the knowledge or the study of the development of arts which is the things that we can create so technology is not about the objects is about the subject and what does it mean that technology does n't describe the tools that we create it describes the ability that a human have has to create to manifest something So technology is not speaking about the physical aspects that we use but technology is explaining about the gifts that a person has in order to manifest to create beauty in the world So first of all in order to learn how we can create and manifest from our own gift we have to go to the first technology that we have created in order to manifest the arts that we have within So let 's go to the very beginning of the technology and for that we have to go to the first being that has the gift to create to manifest which is the first artist of the reality the first artist of the reality is the one the only one which is the self of the universe demand this center is the one that expands and creates three other aspects of itself that we call consciousness consciousness and subconsciousness so this is what we used to call the super consciousness the super consciousness or the super conscience is the oneself the unity that that holds within the other three different aspects of itself so this one is the mind that is creating my ideas everything that everything that we could that that the self can express can create so now we have this three different consciousness that we will call the first one the spiritual world the spirit the other one the consciousness of the soul and the other one would be the consciousness of the body these three different consciousness are born from the one the only one and unique self so this only one being first will as any artist will need to inspire to to inspire itself in order to reach the idea and to understand how to to create to manifest so the first thing that an artist in the cosmos needs is inspiration and that 's the origin of the word spirit spirit remember means from Latin speed added speed added means to breathe so to breathe inspiration yes inhalt is the concept of the spirituality that brings inspiration to the oneself in order to create so here we have that the spiritual level is the one that inspire the one consciousness in the universe to manifest to create to project ideas through thoughts , through concept concepts and so on the concept of the inspiration when it gets inspire the self gets inspired by the spirits it starts to to project the idea into the outside so when it projects into the outside it creates a wave of movement this movement is the one that creates energy and this energy is why we call emotion so the movement of the idea is the movement of the soul so so it 's not so it 's equal to animation it 's equal to the movement of the things so so that 's how we can relate the soul is the energy itself that creates that creates the potentials the potentialities of the mind so the spirit things has an idea and when it moves the soul the aspect of the spirit in movement that we call the soul is the one that activates the potentially for that idea to become real creating a network of positive and negatives from within to the outside creating this web around of the creation the movement of the soul creates so much energy and so much polarity by it so many potentials that they start to to be attracted one another so they started to get all together and because of this gathering of the energy because of this gathering of the energy they they start to create by polarity that the strings the particles the atoms the molecules and so on creating the matter and that matter creates the the body so the body is the product of the soul of the movement of this energy so what this means that the main idea of the sort of the mind of the universe the unity of the universe in stars itself in the world of the ideas which is the spiritual plain the spiritual level and the spiritual level itself the idea moves itself moves itself creating the energy and that energy is the soul the movement so this movement of energy is the one creating then the body the matter okay so so is the matter is the result of that movement so why I 'm I 'm explaining this in order to understand that spirit soul and body are the three of them the same thing only one thing in three different aspects as we spoke in some other videos spirit soul and body are exactly like the three aspects of the water solid liquid and gas so the three can the three of them are different but the three of them are water okay so that 's the whole eternity is not separate things is the same thing in different ways let 's try to understand this because a lot of people have asked this the soul the soul is not getting in and getting out of the body so to understand this about the the soul the soul is not getting in and getting out of the body the soul contract or expands from the body so the spirit does n't get in or get out of the body the spirit and lights or turn off hmm so the process that we say to die yeah the process that we say to die is not that the soul gets out of the body is that the soul expands from the body another concept is that the spirit when you die does n't experience the ascension the spirit turns on it 's not ascending is enlightening okay which is different so when we experience this thing of star of beings coming out from us or beings coming inside of us is not exactly like this is basically one only being expanding and contracting in many different dimensions hmm when we speak about coming out of the body when we sleep and so on it 's just the same body experiencing itself in different dimensions so what this brings to us that we are spirits manifested through the energy of the soul in a physical experience in a physical form so we are not spirits from other levels being download into the matter to live a human experience we are spirits expanding itself creating the matter through its own energy to manifest themselves I hope that we can understand this concept because we are going to link that with technology hmm so it 's important to understand this concept because it 's not about saying that spirit soul and body are different things or what are the differences of these things hmm they are not different from one another they have different attributes in different states of its evolution okay so this means that spirit is something and then becomes something different and then what that we call soul and then becomes something different that is the body so the the best way to understand this is like the caterpillar the cocoon and the butterfly okay so these are three different concepts three different concepts but what we have to acknowledge is that the butterfly is not different from the caterpillar because the butterfly is the caterpillar but it has changed into a new level of consciousness so it does n't mean that the caterpillar lives inside in a little part of the butterfly no it means that the butterfly is the caterpillar in another level of consciousness and evolution so why is important to understand this to get this idea that they are not different and separate things in the universe it means that everything is a net and network connected one to another a network of ideas that manifest in a reality so all this that is connected this network that we all are is a perfect network of creation to manifest by creativity where the ideas become real so this is beauty this is art this is the name so this means that if the mind that this sign all the things by the ideas that had the dream and the ability to to imagine to create express itself in energy in order to move their ideas and to create this web by energy and polarity to manifest in a body the experience of that idea this means that there 's no one up there as a god or a saquillator or as a spirit creating from up from up from above this means that the creator of this thing is within the null within in a tiny part is within everywhere in each part of myself so now let 's go to this Trinity of the mind the if we start with the subconscious if we leave our lives through the subconscious this means that we are going to leave our lives through survival through the cells through this net in the physical reality which means that we will leave our lives through this main three things that are to eat to reproduce and to sleep the main three needs and then we can also move our lives through the unconscious which would be to leave through the soul the unconscious remember is the energy of the body by polarity okay so from the inside to the outside positive negative emotion so the unconscious will will take us to leave through the polarity of the energies that are outside ourselves so that 's why we leave through groups through what we like what we do n't like we leave by being pushed by the outside energies hmm so if we rule our lives through the consciousness this means that we are ruled by the spiritual world which is that we can decide for our own path our own life we are free from the touchments of the other things around okay so usually we as humans leave through the unconscious and the subconscious which is that we leave through our needs and what others have to give to us okay that 's what we usually do so this means that we leave through the body and the soul and the energy of the soul means all the pre concepts that the soul has been storageing as a registry through every experience through history hmm so when I become conscious so when I connect with my own spirit hmm when I connect with my own spirit it means that I can connect with the basis of the creation of myself of the things that I have within okay so when I start to manifest the spirit in me I can also transform myself my own body my own creations so I can become an alchemist transforming my own and the reality around because the reality has its basis in the spirit so who was the spirit the spirit is the aspect of the creator and that aspect is within us is in every part of us so when we connect with that part of the divine we start to manifest what we feel what we believe what we whatever because we are the creator remember that in order to connect to the spirit which is the seed of all this of all this creation we have to go through the unconscious and the subconscious which are like these layers so in order to get to the seed we have to go through the healing of the soul and the understanding and honoring of our body if we do n't get into these two other layers we are not going to reach the seed which is the basis of the creation so the reason why we are not being able to to create to connect with the divine with the seed of the divinity that we have all around us because we are the divine expressed here but the reason why we are not being able to that is because this is the light of the consciousness is shut down and why is this is it 's turned off why is this because we are in coherent with the healing of the subconscious in the body and the unconscious in the soul when we start to heal these other two levels then the conscious spirit starts to turn on the light okay so this consciousness which is in the center is the creator itself is the artist but this artist is the one that started to manifest to create all these other realities and suddenly this reality is that it created by itself started to consume the artist turning off its light the creator itself the creator itself through the construction of webs through the network of the energy of the soul and then the construction through the history of the soul this matter which is the history of our body all this network that we have created is the product of this this technology this is the technology that the creator itself has done so all the gifts all the the the powers the potentials that we have inside in our cells in our body and everything that we are is our own technology we have designed these for thousands of years so remember that the spirit is not outside the spirit is this but express in a different way so we are the artist that has created this technology this is the reason why we need to honor our bodies because the divine is not outside is ourselves the biology is the perfect technology of all that was created by the spirit because it is the spirit this is a link of thousands of networks one over the other interconnection and creating this perfect machine able to express to talk to watch to perceive to make philosophy to think to mediate to do whatever we want which is spiritual the spirit without this networks of the physical body would n't be able to do anything and not because the spirit is something outside and we are the body no it 's because the body is the spirit itself creating itself the only way a spirit can express is through the networks that himself has created so what is how do you manifest you manifest by just doing things some manifest by cooking some others painting a frame some others building house some others doing medicines some others doing music some other speaking manifestation is to make things is to put the potential that we have outside manifestation is to make a fest a party with your hands that 's the origin of the word manifest so remember technology is not the object is the subject remember that the next 2000 years we will be living in the Aquarium era and technology is the base of this we ca n't even imagine how much technology we will have in this era will be like the futuristic thing that we usually think about but the thing is that sometimes we ask ourselves today why technology is so bad why technology is doing so harm to the planet and to the people so no let 's re signify the question let 's remake the question is not why technology the question is why us why we are using our ability to manifest our artistic capacities to destroy and to control technology is doing anything wrong we are the ones using it in a wrong way and why is that because technology is born from the spirit from the spirit and the spirit in order to manifest needs to go through the unconscious and the subconscious which is my soul and my body but if I do n't heal the history of my soul which is how do I relate with people and the history of my body which is how what I need of the world if I do n't work with those things whatever I create and manifest for my spiritual level will be manifested through my attachments to people and my needs of the world and that is why technology the beauty of myself controls and harm the world and people so remember the spirit is the one that decides through the intention to manifest in order to create things but it 's not someone from the outside the spirit is itself creating its own technology of networks in order to be able to experience its own creation and the way in which it does this is through the consciousness manifest in it creating the subconscious the unconscious sorry to manifest itself in the subconscious to this networks of creation it 's what we call technology everything that we are is the art of being this is why the ability to manifest and create is in the spirit which is not above is within in all the parts of our self whatever I manifest from my consciousness in the spirit without being worked in the unconscious of my soul which is the attachments and the subconscious of my body which is the needs so myself and consciousness will control my creation and all this is what we call technology because the Greeks call it the art of know yourself so let 's go to the information for today and remember for more details read the blog the vibration for today is the statement for today is I am the essence of its me the code for today is iron the heavy mental produced by stars is one of the most abundant in our planet most of all the 70 % of it is found in the nucleus in the core that by moving under the great pressure of magma and the cortex generates a great inner geological discharge that creates a magnetic field that orders the conscience of the world from north to south and protects the world from the deadly rays of the sun another fundamental element for all living beings that it does and animals so related to to the iron something that I wrote in the blog and that I think is important in this technology is that is to understand this magnetic field okay this magnetic field basically is the one that connects the whole pattern of our body information that we have within so this is what I was explaining about how the soul expands when it goes outside and expands looking to different perspective perceptions in different dimensions and then it goes back again from the north from the top okay so that 's what we call the higher self our perception of the higher self coming from the heavens to earth and to for to us it 's not it 's not that it 's a being coming from the highest places in the heaven is basically ourselves expanding our questions looking for the answers outside changing our point of use and the answer can 's back to us so it 's all like a total system and the perception from our void from our body is that it comes from above so that 's why we call it the higher self so basically with this I 'm killing this brutality too but anyway it was it was hard for me to when I saw this in this way but anyway so this is the the worst way to kill this brutality and all the patterns that we have by saying that why do we have a higher self well basically because we have iron in our blood it 's all because of iron and the magnetism of it so yeah so let 's go to this for those who are asking how can I do it how can I how can I make this alignment or to balance the subconscious and so on so basically I just remind you that this is like the okay thank you like the video number 175 so so you have like 175 videos to see in which I try to explain this how so it 's only about 300 hours so no rush so let 's go to the line so sit comfortable close your eyes and start to make it soft massage from your feet to your head oh so I become aware of my breathing. This perfect machine , which I see , I credit my choir! I become aware , paying attention to each part of my body , to the muscles , the bones , glands , organs , and the systems above all the circulatory and the nervous system. Take a deep breath , take a deep breath and think about your brain , this amazing organ made with the neurons , the cells that expand information by pulling all around the body to each one of the cells and receive an information through them by impulse towards my understanding.

My pay attention to my heart and its heartbeat pulsed by electricity , pushing the blood through the veins of my body , bringing oxygen and nutrients flourishing the entire body , each cell of it. My pay attention to the system of my digestion , the organs of my digestive system , are a perfect combination that absorb everything that makes me good and makes me fine and expels everything that hurts me. That 's a perfect system. I bring my attention to my genitals , receiving the beauty of the technology that manifests and generates life.

My entire body is the perfect way of creation and design , my spirit , imposed by the energy of my soul. And now I recognize that I am also only one cell inside a huge network of other human cells. Imagine that network. We are the perfect design of technology.

We are the spirit manifested in the matter. And between all of us we create tools , cultures , civilizations , art. We are the creators of our own reality. Take a deep breath and I recognize myself as an important piece in the technology of life and existence.

And I seem to activate my creative potential , a secretator in this network. My personality , my body , my soul , my ego. The concept of its meaning are the ones that represents the tool , the technology to be able to create and manifest a new reality. My honor , the me in order to be.

My heart , the me in order to be. My heart , the me in order to be. My heart , the me in order to be. My heart , the me in order to be.

My heart , the me in order to be. My heart , the me in order to be. I am the essence of its me. I am the essence of its me.

I am the best technology that makes spirit could have been created. I am the artist of my own self. I am the best and come back here and now by stretching , to raise the body. I am the best and the me in order to be.

Thank you everybody for being there as always and see you tomorrow the same time.
