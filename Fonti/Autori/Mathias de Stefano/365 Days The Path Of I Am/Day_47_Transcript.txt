hi everyone good morning good evening good night 
as you can see i am with a lot of people and in another place 
so i don't know if i'm gonna be there concentrate today 
[Laughter] she wanted to say hi to everyone 
they just arrived one hour ago we met all together so 
so they don't even know why they're here uh but 
that's why i will try to make a short message for today 
so so we could keep going so let's 
begin so the issue we are going to discuss today 
is about denial 
can you hear me well i hope now you can hear me better 
so uh the issue today is um denial sorry i'm like with many things in my 
head so i will try to do my best to remember what i said 
so the ability uh the concept of manipulation was related to the 
ability to create to handle the situations uh one of the things that i've been 
reading in the messages that that i was reading in all the comments that you were doing 
is uh uneven in myself how difficult is for 
uh many of us to to realize um to accept most of the things that 
are um that that we manipulate or that are manipu manipulated by the outside 
so basically what we start to do is to um 
to when we perceive like for example in the concept of relation of religion and the 
concept of governments we the first thing that we start to do is to 
relate it with control so when we uh begin uh we will start with the process 
of uh denial to uh all these systems we start to deny them can you hear me well 
the image doesn't matter the sound is the thing 
so the main thing that we have to understand from the text of today is that we have two different ways of 
denial so these two concepts are related one of them 
will deny those things that i don't like and the other one is to deny all those things 
that i don't recognize in myself so the first denial 
uh of the things that i don't like is something that we all have 
from the origin of our biology because by um by living in this world we have 
been adopting ourselves on the survival so we were trying to 
deny to um to deny everything that breaks my stability 
what i am what we are trying to do is to basically uh push away 
everything that um that tries to take us out of 
our uh core of our center what this concept helps us to remember 
is that that this concept of this um this comet concept of 
being stable is that everything that exists is trying to 
earn um to earn energy so basically the reason why everything 
is looking for stability is not only because of us it's because the atoms and 
molecules that they also try to put together so they could share and to find um 
the balance um so they could share energy and they 
could be um they could be stable so they could earn their own 
energy so basically if you have an atom that has a low charge of energy and another 
one with a big charge of energy positive so they will meet each other so 
they can share energy and to find stability so all the creation 
is created uh in order to to earn energy 
sorry but everything is new there's no sign here signal sorry and um everything is new so 
so basically what i was saying is that everything in the reality is trying to look for 
the way in which they uh can earn much energy and not waste 
energy basically we humans do the same we try to look for 
um good places where we feel safe where we could earn that energy 
why there is this need to energy to hold the energy within because 
we need to transform and transcend ourselves 
and the way in which we can understand is two different ways 
i survived which is the metamorphosis the transformation of 
being and um the other one would be 
reproduction so basically the reason why we need um um 
why they we we need to earn a lot of energy by biology 
is because we need to put all this energy in those two aspects in order to 
transcend we have to um to take all this energy for only those 
moments so basically this is why all the plants and animals they try to 
hold as much as energy as possible during its life so they could use it in the moment of 
reproduction so this is why naturally the body 
interprets that anything that means a change that is not necessary 
besides the reproduction is something that could be bad for me 
because it doesn't help me to survive we have two concepts here one is the 
stability okay and the other one is to be always in the same shape 
stability means the ability to stay all the time in the same spot 
in the same place so um the other concept besides stability 
which is to be constantly in the same spot uh we have the 
to hold the same shape constantly the same form constantly not to change which 
we call to be in the comfort zone 
conform conform okay to be conformed with a reality 
this is why our biology is constantly saying to us don't change 
because if you change we are losing energy and if we lose energy we can die 
so one of the things that we have to understand is that this is something that helps us to be who we are to 
survive in history to be here instead of evolving and instead of going 
ahead and to develop ourselves what we start to do is to deny 
everything that can come and transform myself everything new so 
it's here when we understand the concept of denial 
so basically the concept of 
denial is another [Music] example 
so by understanding this we can picture that that 
is not something it's not something bad for us but it can stop our evolution 
so remember that um the concept the concept of denial is something that helps you to survive 
because it protects you from everything that can 
come from the outside and to stop 
your life basically uh sorry if i am speaking faster i don't 
know um i'm just trying to understand the new energetical pattern sorry 
the the the the thing is that there are too many minds in the same place so this is why 
i'm trying to adapt to the new situation 
um um i will try to repeat it 
slowly the concept let's remember 
so remember that in nature everything is trying to earn as much as 
energy as possible so it could find stability to survive 
so from the tiny atoms to the big galaxies 
all of them are trying to find stability saving energy 
these create patterns that give security to the creation 
so basically nature says if i stay exactly with the same shape 
what i am what i can do is to save this energy for the moment 
i can to i can't transform myself so basically in different aspects the 
ways in you in which you can transform yourself in nature is by metamorphosis 
and um and reproduction so this is why basically nature is 
saving all this energy to arrive to that moment and use it for 
that specific uh moment of life 
so what this means that as much stability 
the best i can conform myself the concept of 
as i confirm formation is to uh to keep the same shape constantly 
what nature does when they feel that there is a change coming 
from outside nature what they do is to what it does is to 
protect itself and deny that reality outside 
so basically when the nature is trying to protect the same form from everything that is outside 
is also losing the ability to adapt itself into other 
environments so this is why evolution only comes when 
i allow myself to go outside of me and start to roll and to go around 
in different environments so this is what evolution means is to go 
out and start to make turns another word that we can use is to 
take away all the layers that i have to um 
to take all these envelopes around okay so i can 
i can um uh see different things outside of me 
so for example the concept that we have um in in english to explain this 
is that we are like kind of an in an envelope okay 
all uh envelope um our body with many things so when i 
allow myself to take away all these envelopes i go outside myself and we 
call that development 
so when i allow myself to go outside my system what i do is to 
start to take new things to grab new things 
for me and in all english that would be to learn 
and that's the origin of the world learn which is to acquire something new 
when we accept to change and use our energy in order to change our lives we evolve 
but those who cannot do that by fear and they deny 
the transformation the change so they close everything and they stay behind 
so we have two different ways in which we usually deny 
one is denial by not liking something 
because it disgusts me and the other one is denial by 
just not recognizing that thing on me 
so usually by nature what we usually do is to deny everything that is outside 
and the way i deny it is by i don't like it so i don't want to know 
anything about it so basically what we start to do when we hear something that is 
uh that we don't like we start to say no i don't like this i don't want this 
this is not with me we start to deny all these realities 
outside and we do it just by survival 
it means that is something that will go against my [Music] 
so it will transform what i am so this is why the problem that we have 
they believe that what we have now here and now is the right thing 
and then we have in the other hand um those things that we don't recognize in 
ourselves that we don't know from ourselves the denial by no recognize recognition 
is when somebody says to you you are this and you say no i'm not that 
so basically the great conflict that we have with denial is that 
before before saying why 
we always say first no so when i first say no 
is because something within me is feeling unsecure insecure of something that is 
outside and if my inside is feeling insecure 
is because there is something that i didn't work with let's try to understand this that we 
usually uh we are good in the stuffs that we 
accept in ourselves and the stuff that how to handle what to use 
to create from ourselves and what happened with the things that we deny that we don't have tools for 
those things so what happened that 
when i received the heat of something from what i don't have 
uh tools for so it makes me weak 
so basically what we do by denying things is not to accept that we need new tools 
to adapt ourselves in new environments so remember this that 
those people that says no are those who close themselves 
and deny so they want to survive and they don't evolve 
so the question would be why if so many other beings in the planet has 
been evolving in that way by just protecting the energy why should we do it in a different way 
why should we transform like that by understanding the denial 
and the reason why we have to do this is because we as humans has been through all the stages 
of the denial evolution and now we are starting 
a new process expansion of consciousness so basically the people that are looking 
for the expansion of consciousness are the people that should not be close 
so one of the things that we must understand in order to go into another 
level of consciousness is to accept what are we denying 
so we could know what are the things that are stopping ourselves from evolution 
we usually would say think in the past that yes but i've been said a lot of things that i 
know that i am not the question would be who am i 
so we have to remember that we're not just simple 
individuals separated from each other we are the result 
of a group of individuals that we call the tree of the family tree 
and remember that not only from the past but daily 
now we are all connected constantly by emotional links 
so what i have to start doing when someone asks me or tells says to me 
you are this is not to just say no i'm not like that is to 
start to think where in my own self 
i have that information that somebody else can see it 
because if someone is saying that is because of something so remember that 
every word and every emotion that is moving around is like an ocean everything is connected 
nobody says something just because he wants 
so we have to start to recognize where are all these uh denials and why do we take it 
because remember that when we become aware of that things that we are denying 
that denial becomes a tool for our evolution 
in nature there is no waste everything recycles 
no so this is why when we speak about uh denial never say no 
just say why from where from whom 
so that's the key so the first time that i received this information many time ago 
i i i did the same question that was but that's a exhausting that it's like 
doing all this all the time constantly wondering why and why and why 
so basically what diane said was while you don't question the causes you 
will be leaving the consequences so basically what it means is that i will always be 
a reaction and i won't take action never 
and basically that then is just a second it's like it's like an exercise you have 
to practice it and when we practice that as much as we can 
we will see that we turn ourselves more unconditional and neutral in our lives 
and so basically the only way you can get into another level of consciousness is by doing that 
so a lot of exercise vibration we are going to work with today is the sound ho 
remember that the sound means the spark and o means the body 
related to the root chakra so the statement for today is i am the 
spark that ignites the body 
the spiritual pattern for today is 
like the letter x the sound expands from its from the 
origin in a spiral which amplifies its spectrum in positive 
outwards in positive outwards to return in a spherical dance towards 
the center contracting in a negative spiral the toroidal 
form of this eternal spiral is positive and negative energies 
of positive and negative energies mold the cosmos balance 
the sa sound expresses this form like a spark enlightening a huge fire 
that consumes everything into ashes and it all starts again 
kundalini so let's start with the alignment um 
i've been reading that many of you where 
sleepy in the alignments or while i speak don't worry 
if you need to sleep just sleep it's good for integrating information 
i start to massage the body caress the body stretch 
yawn die focus in my breathing 
i use my imagination to feel the oxygen 
coming through my nose towards my lungs 
heart blood 
organs [Music] and muscles 
i allow myself to feel the heat within my body 
the energy and how it goes outside 
through the skin towards every direction [Music] 
i feel the energy the heat expanding 
in an ocean of vibration around me 
i allow myself to perceive how the waves of the sea 
move my body to one side and another 
[Music] 
i observe above my head over the sea 
the light of the sun shining 
being the i am 
[Music] take deep breath and with each breathing 
i start to go up to the surface 
[Music] 
a crown [Music] and i started to go out as an island in the middle of the ocean 
[Music] so your forehead 
eyes ears nose 
lips [Music] 
neck shoulders 
your back your chest 
your arms belly 
waist hands 
him and her genitals 
and i start to feel the heat of the sun [Music] 
wore [Music] drying my skin all over my body 
and penetrate by the skin [Music] towards the chakras 
take a deep breath and perceive the light of the i am 
anchoring in the crown third eye 
throw heart plexus 
sacrum [Music] and shine in your roots 
[Music] 
i recognize that in my genitals 
there is all the energy [Music] that is related with the fight 
to protect my body [Music] 
i recognize that there i can find everything that i have 
learned and also everything that i have tonight 
i recognize that there i can find strength 
to move my safe myself forward towards evolution and also 
the strength that pushed me back by fear 
stopping my evolution [Music] 
i make myself the question [Music] what is the thing that i deny the most 
in my life and there i will realize 
my biggest witness but also my biggest strength 
[Music] 
and this is why i bring the light of the i am to bring 
clarity to my denial irradiating 
so i can understand it and use it 
i start to vibrate soft as i observe 
how it irradiates [Music] 
keep pronouncing the sound 
i keep pronouncing the sound as i project and see how this light is all over the sea 
[Music] bringing clarity 
to all of my denials 
i recognize them i accept them 
and i make them tools to enlighten my body 
[Music] 
i feel the spark in my genitals irradiating the light 
of the kundalini and i recognize 
i am the spark that enlightens my body 
i am the spark that lights my body 
take a deep breath [Music] all the strength and sound 
set free all the power of the kundalini up 
[Music] 
my heart 
everything that i deny is my evolution 
only by recognizing it i turn it 
into a useful tool 
this is why i recognize i am 
take a deep breath and i start to bring all this 
consciousness through my body caressing 
stretching massaging and yawning 
and slowly i come back here now opening my eyes 
i'm good so homework 
we are still in birgo so the task would be to write down 
the biggest denials that i have in my life very simple 
[Music] 
so rest and um 
so tomorrow we meet again at the same time bye - Generated with https://kome.ai
