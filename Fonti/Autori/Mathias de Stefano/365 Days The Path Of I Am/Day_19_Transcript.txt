hi everyone good morning good evening good night
are you today
i don't know if you all have uh have read the blog today
even if you didn't do it i will try to make a summary to clarify some some ideas
to be all in the same page
i guess
today has been something moving something
moved us
i guess
many of you maybe have been it was a bit shocking as of course it was for me for myself the first time
i
i got to
when i got
information
this is
i would like to talk a little bit about the concept
we could clarify it
to begin
basically the information of today is about
is linked to our ankles to our feet in relation to our path to our um to our destiny
to our purpose in life
the concept of the purpose was the one we were talking about
basically the answer of the higher self was relax
there is no purpose
there is no god
about
is
i wanted to talk a little bit we have a concept of god
is projected from our human perspective from our mammal perspective us through history we designed god in our own image
resemblance
everything
we could have every idea
we could have of
is god is precisely
is an idea
it's not real is a perception
to understand
is we have to go outside from our perspective
maybe look into the universe from the perspective of a plant does the that's god created the plant to its own image if everything is just a projection from god
why do we humanize god
we perceive the universe from our point of view the god in
we believe doesn't exist is just an idea
the universe does exist
therefore
is something
is true
it's not the god in
we believe
we can all say
god is a holy trinity totally agree with
that is the holy trinity
why i can agree
god is a trinity
for everything to exist we need three things an electron neutron
proton
everything
comes from
trinity is divine
maybe we want to appreciate
in different shapes is our own idea our own perception
basic trinity is whole by another trinity
we call subconscious unconscious
conscience
these three of them are connected in just one spot
we call mind
it's not about
mind
is not the mind
is just a processor is like a computer the mind is the i am is everything
exists
this is like a big cell subconscious unconscious
conscious
thing
we call the mind in three different levels is a is a mind
is trying to understand itself constantly
it's looking for thousands
millions of ways to understand itself
humans are just another one of these parts trying to look for
answer
is
is ourselves who project the idea of god
it's just us ourselves
god trying to understand itself therefore does god exist no
it can't exist yes watch
many people is broken right
in their own structures
of
everyone i also went through
i'm not i'm not hoping for you to understand
now each one has its own time i am just sharing
but i'm just sharing
because you are listening otherwise i wouldn't the only reason
we as humans need the image of a god a plan
someone
decided everything is
we as humans need a dad
tells us
to do
every human needs a mother
says to us don't worry relax i will love you anyway mom
dad one of the greatest challenges
we the ones
are the seekers of consciousness have is to to realize
we are the tools for
divine to know itself
this helps us to understand something
the universe is an artist is an artist
doesn't have a purpose we put our purpose in our lives we design our lives with a purpose
we all know
we are going to die
a human realizes
it is going to die we create our lives with the sick of a purpose
we
at the moment we know
that life is going to end we need to create another purpose bigger purpose
is god heaven whatever you want to call it
when we try to understand
the universe works we would understand
this is not lineal
this is not going up is a circle
because
is a circle or a sphere
is nowhere to go it's myself who decide
to move
there is not a creator over us everything is the creator the design
we have of a creator on the top saying hey sons
daughters
is the plan
you have to do it's a very human social
cultural thing
the reason
we ask
is the meaning of everything
if
is no god
is the meaning of everything is
since
we are childs is mom
dad the teacher at school
give us the answers
we have created in our own subconscious
someone else must have all the answers we have created
projected a divinity hoping for
master teacher mom or dad
this is
we call to the universe to god the mother or the father
this is
to their son to its sons we call them masters did you never realize about
isn't
just something from our childhood
for a moment let's imagine
when you are 18 years old you just realize
your mom your dad your teachers had lied to you all your life
in
moment with 18 years old i made my question
is the meaning of everything
there i have only an option
do i do i have to keep living i am only 18 years old
do i do first i get mad with everyone
lied to me
then i realized something
they didn't lie to me
they just told me the answers they had or they could answer me
i let them free from
i believed of them
the fourth stages is i start to look for the answers myself
when i find the answers i realize
i am the only one able to create my own destiny
what is the next step to go back to my parents to teach them
to create their own destiny at
moment we realized
the system the whole system was lying to us
not
they were lying
because they had only those answers
so we are still looking to
with a very human perspective maybe it looks like i am saying
uh from a human perspective maybe it looks like um i'm saying
nothing exists the masters everything doesn't exist
no i'm not saying
i'm just saying
them the masters the guides the angels they all exist
they are doing exactly the same as us
the masters used to say to you you are your own master you can find your own path you create your own destiny
do you believe they are saying are they saying
you can create your own destiny
god has a plan for you no
they are saying is
everyone
everything
exists is billions of beings creating itself constantly
brings us to the meaning the meaning of everything has been created by us in different levels of consciousness
when i used to say god has a plan for me it's not god it's my own consciousness
was myself my own kindness creating a whole plan to understand itself until
i have a purpose
the universe has a purpose no
there is a purpose yes i know
this is maybe a philosophical aspect
this is
the universe is it's not straight
that we go to our feet we have to understand in the emotional way
we have to go further to create our own destiny
do i call god
how do i call god as he himself called it he calls himself like
i am i am who i am it was always
but as humans we need to project it in the outside
it's good it's good it's not um uh it's not wrong to believe in god it's not wrong to to i don't know to have another idea
the reason
we're
is to talk about
and
comes
question
judgment
we may say
is
so a joke from the mind
is our problem of having
conflict
inner conflict
we need
everything should be part of the grace of someone else or by the guilty of someone else
this is just
since
we were kids we haven't been taught about
to become responsible of our own reality our own life
it's always easier to control the other ones
the other ones doesn't have responsibility it's easier for someone
controls to handle the guilt than the freedom
this is
it's important for all the people
we are
doing
to acknowledge
we have a lot of responsibility ahead
it doesn't matter
god you believe in it doesn't matter
religion you have it doesn't matter if you are at his artist or or just believe in science you will get to the same point
you are the only one able to transform the reality someone did a question
i would like to to answer with a tiny answer
i know it's not the complete answer the question was who created them the proton who created the first thing let's bring
to another concept more emotional
is
what we are closing
when i
i get in fell in love
i fall in love with another person who decides
much love do we make an agreement first
do we do
how do you decide
this is like a pulse a beat
it creates
much power
energy expands
have a lot of ideas
emotions
suddenly starts to create to feel
it can do anything
is
we say the universe is love it's a pulse nobody is waiting to fall in love it just happened nobody decides the perfect moment to fall in love it's just a pulse
from
pulse you create everything take a deep breath
let's break our feet the last chakra ankles ankles feet
mixing languages the vibration of the day is who who who the vibration is h the life
the sound wu is the anchor is materializing the realities
the statement for today is i am the i am life materializing ideas check the relation with
we have spoken today i am the life materializing jds anchoring the ideas the vibration today is yi

slowly i put them around my ankles i observed them as a wheel or a circle
i recognize
in the core of it it's the chakra
represents my destiny
purpose take a moment to receive the idea of
i believe is my own destiny
purpose in life without limitations no judgment just let the idea to come take a deep breath recognize acknowledge
destiny
purpose within you doesn't matter
small or big it is it's within you
it's yours
exactly the same as i have knowledge
this is mine i also acknowledge
it is just an idea a projection
is not real i recognize also
my destiny
purpose linked to my feet are just the perception
the projection of
others want me to do
what myself expect from others to see
project at the moment i can accomplish my purpose take a deep breath
i descend the i am to my feet i recognize i can accomplish my purpose i can accomplish my destiny i can become my own purpose i start to pronounce the vibration as i see
the wheel starts to spin faster
faster filling with the energy the motion activating the light of my feet as i pronounce the sound one
i continue pronouncing the sound as i feel
the light of my feet starts to shine in every direction
i recognize
i am the only one able to create my purpose i am the only one able to accomplish
get my destiny for i am my own purpose
destiny
i watch
the light of my feet starts to embrace the purpose i created
my idea
it starts to absorb it as fuel to create my own purpose i set myself free from expectations from whatever the others expect from me i set myself free from
i expect from myself therefore i acknowledge
if
is no purpose outside i am the only one able to create a new one
i answer like
the questions of my life i question
is my mission i am my mission
is my purpose i am the purpose i expand the energy of my purpose towards the whole network of purposes
are being created right
that are part of me i observe each one of them with its own purpose within the great purpose of the being i take my hands to my heart breathe in i can't be my purpose for i am the life manifesting the ideas i am the life manifesting the ideas i am the life manifesting the ideas
i start to bring
information
consciousness from my heart towards my whole body careersing massaging stretching
yawning come back
and
opening my eyes breathe in
exhale
