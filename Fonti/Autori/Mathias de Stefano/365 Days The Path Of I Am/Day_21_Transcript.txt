good morning good evening good night wherever you are welcome all of you to the week of the fiscal week of the month related to the constellation of leo remember
uh we are still in the month of leo even if uh yesterday has taught uh in our cedroll calendar the the time of virgo okay the constellation of virgo
we are not following the cedrile um uh astrology right
we are following the ancient calendar related to the constellations
doesn't have any correlative with
we are working today um
we have today as a cidral calendar okay
we are not talking about an astrological month
we are doing we are we are
working with the calendar relating with the concept of the constellations
not the astrological aspect or the timing of the constellations okay
today we start with with the last week of um of the month of leo okay
in 10 days it ends
just to be clear um
i wrote today maybe was a bit complicated somehow
just to explain you to tell you about
i just um put the first line
i have no idea
i'm going to write i'm just allowing the higher self to express to talk
so i start to write
the information
is around is coming
um sometimes um even for me it's sometimes hard to understand
i wrote um i have to read it again
so i will try to explain a little bit today even if it's if it was weird to understand everything was related with the head today our day is related with the head with a physical aspect of the crown chakra okay
the crown chakra is anchored in the physical way of the gland
we call hypothesis i know
in english you don't used to call it hypothesis you used to call it pituitary gland
i don't like to call it pituitary
um pituita is the name in latin for nuts nuts okay um
they used to to believe
that gland was the one created the nuts
um
i think it's disrespectful for the spirit yeah it's not yeah the thing you know
to say
the thing is
this gland the hypothesis is under the hypothalamus okay
um is a small gland
the crown chakra is anchored okay
this gland is the one
materialized the crown chakra
the energy of the crown chakra is
it means
this gland is the one
connects the whole high higher self inside our body
this gland
is the hypothesis is the one
organized
makes the balance in between all the other glands is the one controlling the hormones okay
um
kind of is the most important gland
it says
to work to the rest
it's the gladly in charge of the homostasis
homostasis is to have balance in the whole body okay if we want to reach for
gland we have to make a line in between our ears
in the center we will find
tiny gland
it means
when the pineal the hypothesis the pituitary the hypothesis gland is trying to make our body imbalanced in harmony is also related with the organ
tries to make us be imbalanced
not to get dizzy
is the liquid in our inner ears okay
the hearing is the sense
tries to put balance okay try to put balance in our body it's
of our ears
we can walk still straight okay
don't get dc
when a person gets dc is
it's
you are trying to get imbalance okay
you have maybe a problem of uh unbalancing okay
it is
of the ear is related to the center to the hypothesis
is
the balance of our self is related with our head coming up like
from up below in our higher self
the balance in our in our ears
here in the core of the of the brain of the head we have the balance of the whole self
the higher self was trying to explain is
when we feel dc
we lose our balance is
we forgot
to be harmonious
this chakra is related to the hearing to hear is um the tool
we have to understand
is music talking the words
we know we must know
one of the biggest problems
we have in our humanity today is
we don't know
to listen maybe it's happening to some of you right
that we are
we are waiting
much to hear
we want to hear
we don't wait
listen
it's being said
this is one of the biggest problems of humanity not to listen we usually speak louder in order to cover the other people talking
we don't we don't want to hear
they have to say we want to put our idea on it
this is something
can shows us very in a practical way
a person is disconnected with its higher self
a person doesn't listen it's
that's a listening to itself
this is one of the main practical ways in
we could understand to realize if we are listening to our higher self or covering it voice its voice with many questions of course many times we try to impose impose uh to put over the others our own beliefs
we are not finished to listen the other ones
usually happens to the outside
this is not
it happens outside the most difficult part of
is
we cannot listen inside to be able to listen to um we must learn
to listen
i will share your practice
of course in the physical aspect we we must begin with the tasks
the task would be to realize
you speak the first word
you say is over the last word of the other person
could be very difficult above all for italian people
argentinian people i know
it's something
we must practice we must learn
to listen
the i am connects them to hearing
is
when we start to connect ourselves with something we start to hear voices sounds i heard the voice of someone whatever sometimes it's not just
there are people speaking to us from another dimension it's just
we are starting to listen to ourselves all the voices
we have with them
this starts to open the capacity of listening
the task would be two
you speak with other realize realize if you start to speak over the other or if you can wait until a space
the talk
is a physical practice
we need to practice a lot if we want to learn
to hear ourselves first of all
we have to do is to learn
to listen the others everyone clear with a task let's do it
sometimes for example
there are people asking give me an example i cannot do the example
i am just myself
uh for example a good example is
is
i am speaking
some people are doing questions are doing questions
um i would say just wait until i speak
some of the questions
you may do you will lose you will lose the possibility to listen the answer
you are making questions
i am answering right
so um that's an example of
we are willing to receive more information
we lose the information
we are receiving in
moment
we are expecting to receive something different of course
this way of acting is very natural for humans
maybe it would take like years to be worked
it's not necessary it's not necessary to work at if you don't as i said there's no need to
um if you are um willing to listen your higher self
you want to listen your higher self
what would be helpful would be to start by listening to others until they finish one of the others the other explanations
i am gave was gave was about music
it's something
is related with listening
i don't understand much about music
trying to understand it maybe i can explain
for example everything is just one sound it's just one vibration
in order to be understood by us we took vibration
divided in concepts
we call notes music notes the main notes
they repeat constantly are 12.
so these 12 are divided in the planes
are the seven main important
we all know guess in english is c d e blah blah blah until b
um
the the medium ones
uh
are the sharks okay
sharp e sharp
on
this vibration they constantly they repeat themselves into low vibration
high vibration
these notes have different aspects
mainly we have a physical aspect energetical aspect
mental aspect
we used to call the body the soul the spirit
keeps going it's not just those three it keeps going to the higher self to the uh to the guides uh to the divine
in the other side the the low vibration into the nature into the darkness
so on
this constant expansion for us is just 12 notes
these notes are divided in ourselves in
chakras these 12 notes we have it in our own body divided in different chakras
each day
we are working in these weeks we have nine of them we are working each one each day
nine days starting
then in the chakras until the feet
then the last day
is the the taurus day the thyroid we work with three of them one the lower feet the other one over her head
the other one is the high heart chakra
is the expansion of everything okay
the torus is the joint of three more the total is 12.
what the higher self was trying to explain
in list of notes we have groups of three notes
creates a co an a a chord
a chord are the ones
create harmony in a melody in a song okay
these three together one of them represents the physical aspect the other one represents the emotional
the other one the mental the mind
the chord aligned they represent a beautiful sound
resounds beautifully inside our ears
in the hypothesis the spirit if i make a mistake
instead of doing the chord
sounds like touch it sounds like they won't sound properly
i will hear like like noisy like something horrible
is exactly the same as the universe is hearing from ourselves
we are incoherent these three notes doesn't sound good
instead of sound beautiful in between our body our soul emotion
our mind in the spirit we sound horribly like voice in order to sound like a beautiful song
must be alignment
balance in between
i do
i feel
what i think
learn
to listen let's do the alignment for
week
last week sorry
let's see it in a comfortable position i'm going to put the music
you um position yourself
the vibration we are going to use today is sa sa is the path
the spirit
the statement for today is i am the spirit's path the code of today is related with the sound ho
is the exhalation of the universe
it says
way the soul cites
seeing the wonderful generation of its energy
emotion of its love the third age is whom exhalation
the ideas of the spirit
emotions of the soul become physical action matter body it's the moment of the great expansion of the enormous explosion
originates our reality known as the big bang
they the spirit creates the matter just a tiny thing
we start some people saying about if um
whom is the same it's not the same whom is the concept of the expansion of the universe
um or i would say better
sound is the joint of all the vowels
are the first sounds of the whole universe of the creation
this is the main sound
created the expansion um we could call it om for friends
it's really difficult to prevent it
let's start carrying the body making a massage to the stretching the body yawning take a deep breath letting the weight fall down i relax my body i focus in my breathing use my imagination to feel
the oxygen goes inside my body to my lungs my heart blood organs
muscles i become aware of the heat
is within my body i become aware of all the light of the i am
surrounds me from the emotional
the mind level i perceive myself as a temple
yourself as being a temple it doesn't matter the shape it can be your body it can be any color any construction i observe the light of the emotional level of the i am as if it is the mood over my skin my construction
i also perceive the i am shining like the sun project with light its light all over my temple i contemplate myself surrounded by these two lights one is warm the other one is fresh take a deep breath
i go to recognize
temple i use my hands
i go from the very top of my head in the crown creasing softly each part of my head until my jaw carries your face your forehead nose ears hair every part of your head as if you were a child knowing for the first time
part of your body let yourself know each corner of your head caressing touching very softly i recognize
part of the temple as the kupole the highest part of the temple the one closer to the light softly i make a soft massage in circles at the sides of my head close by the ears
i take my fingers to touch
massage caressing each corner of my lips take a deep breath in the inside
the outside in the back of the ears
very suddenly i start to massage the atlas back on my head point between the spine
the skull up
down very soft
in circles i start to press towards the ears to both sides ahead go press pressing until my forehead over my third eye
i go back to the crown very softly
i start to make a massage in circles to the head moving around
softly i start to bring all
energy below from the crown to every direction of my head softly i relax my arms take a deep breath deeper
deeper bringing the light of the moon of my emotional
the light of the sun of my mantle deep inside my head as if it is a perfume i smell it inside my head i allowed the light to come inside to the koopale of my temple i perceive
the light
was outside my body
starts to shine in the core of my brain i start to feel to perceive my brain
it starts to get enlightened both hemispheres right
left i perceive the interior the hypothalamus cerebellum the spine every nerve
they watch inside of my brain below the thalamus a beautiful pearl shining my hypothesis take a deep breath
recognize
in
tiny peril is the whole potential of
i can feel
perceive of my reality is the anchor of my spirit in the matter take a deep breath take a deep breath
start to pronounce the vibration making
gland vibrate
shine brighter
brighter towards all my body sun sun sun
so i keep pronouncing the sound
i watch as i pronounce the sound
this gland starts to shine
activate the other glands pushing to the creation of hormones
allows me to feel my emotions
to understand my thoughts take a deep breath i recognize the potential of the spirit within me i can't bring the spirit within me i can't be the spirit i can't be the spirit take a deep breath
i take my hands to the sides of my head touching tips with the tip of my fingers close by the ears
i recommend the potential
my body has i am the path of the spirit i am the path of the spirit i am the path of the spirit i recognize
the spirit created
body as a temple

i start to caress my fingers softly my hands
each part of my body stretching the body yawning i'm coming back
