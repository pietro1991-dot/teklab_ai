hi everyone good morning good evening good night
i found i i hope i find you well to begin with
emotional week just to begin we have to understand
idea
emotion means energy
we usually relate emotion with the soul
emotion
soul are exactly the same thing
emotion is the energy
moves
is positive
negative
creates all the energy
makes us be
we are
the soul is the concept
um
holds within all
energy
made us be
when we are talking about soul we are talking about the registry the records of everything
we are
we um usually say we usually talk is
um the soul is the one
registry everything all the information
we have
this is
we all know
the energy is transforming constantly it's it's endless
it goes through the time
space changing its shapes
adapting to different bodies like from my body to a plant to an animal to another people
so on
that allows us to live different lives in different times of history
that's
we call
the soul has lived many lives
is
the soul is like the like the book
we have written everything
we have
that we have been
what we are
what we will become
this is
also the soul is the one registering making the registry of all the data
we are taking from the relationships with others
the others are a different energy
with ours they match
discharge information
um we have to understand
the relationships we have with other people is exactly as if we put a neuron
another neuron
they make these charges of pulses of energy positive
and negative
they create synapses
by synapses they create information
they create a thought an idea by
so these pulses can be also known as soul
this is
the soul is not just in the heart it's in every part of our self of our being
the energy is pulsing
is
we also call the soul like the key of life
because the soul the energy is these pulses of positive
negatives
is constantly creating
this is life
is
we call the soul like the key of life we have to understand
we have one soul each one of us
we also have another soul
is relating with the group of people
we have another one
relates with millions of beings
we have another one for the cosmos okay
we have many souls
they are all part of the same one
we can compare the soul like uh our body
we have one soul
is created with billions of um cells
imagine
you are a soul
each cell has another soul or is part of
soul
that's
we are all the same
one of the things
we have to understand from the soul is
the soul is a perception a projection from our idea
everything
you may believe or think about
a soul is like karma dharma the lives
you have lived um like another being with its own shape um the pacts
you have done in your soul everything
you could possibly believe about a soul usually is just a projection from your human perspective of the energy
it's your mind trying to shape the concept of
the energy moves
you could understand the you could understand the idea the idea of
it's a soul
going to the base of
is a soul we will find just energetical pulses
these pulses of energy are the ones
storage all the data
information
share all
information
that's
we know
the soul is recording all
information one of the other informations is
the energy the soul is positive
negative
by polarity it constantly create energy
that's
we relate the soul with the with being creative artistic
um the energy by being positive
and negative they move like
like in a spiral constantly
it also gives us the idea of transference to transfer energy
by
transferring of the energy we understand the emotion okay
is the relation with the other people with other beings
these uh emotions are energetical pulses
allow us to transfer
to share information it's like if each one of us is a new neuron
everything
we share in
transference of energy is perceived by us as an emotion is perceived okay from our perspective
this is
all of the emotions are energy perceived by our point of view
this is
if i can handle my own energies my own emotions i am not moved by the energies from the outside
we achieve
we accomplish to be in a neutral state
this is the main goal
we need to find balance in our emotions sometimes we make a big mistake thinking
we have to control our emotions
we have to do instead is to order the perception of the energy our perception of the energy
when i realize about my perception of an emotion of an energy i
know
to handle
energy or
emotion
of my perception of it the energetical system is very easy to understand
difficult to handle
it's everywhere
you cannot take all the energies
talking about the experience in the
this perception let's talk for example about someone
makes us being uh angry okay something happened
makes us angry you have to watch in
moment
the thing
happened the fact is not
makes us being angry is our perception of
situation of
fact
the same fact for example is um is perceived by me like being angry
if you ask another person maybe
same thing doesn't provoke
it it creates another feeling
everything
happens
comes with energy is perceived
received by my own magnetical field
transformed into the level of my own magnetical field
i could understand it
we can say
uh
the energy is like languages
uh the magnetical field is it is the translator of
language
this energy
comes to me will be perceived by my soul or my magnetical field according to the state of
magnetical field
translated translated into our uh into its own way of understanding okay
is the state of my soul
interprets the emotion i don't have to touch the emotion
i have to do is to reorganize my magnetical feel do you get it we used to complicate it very much
we are humans we as humans are poetic we are um very creative um very expressive
we need to spread thousands of ideas of
to understand emotions
it's very easy it's just positive
negative thinking
in
way it makes
makes it feel very mental just with the mind
what helps us
is to understand the mechanism once i understand the map of
how it works
i can go into the practice
is just filling just feeling it okay
if we have the map of
the idea the main idea of
then we just have to go
fill it we don't have to think much
this is
we are going to do
whole week
let's remember the keys of the map every emotion is just an energy
is positive
negative both of them are the polarity
creates energy
energy creates a energetical field
we energetically call
soul
the soul is taking as much as information as it can going into uh different shapes transforming itself through different lives
is
makes
the soul is the eternal life
a soul meets another soul is again like a positive
a negative
when both of them transmit energy it is called emotion
the information the emotion is captured by my magnetic field according to my level of vibration if i am positive or i am negative
makes
all the emotions are just a perception of my state of energy if i allow myself to balance the magnetical field i am able to receive
perceive the emotions in a neutral way if someone comes
and tries to make me angry i will touch the energy of the anger
make it into something constructive
this is taking your your own energy
and use it to your own benefit i guess
this is the most um resume um explanation of the system
it works if you don't get it right
just relax you have your time maybe listen it another time in another moment maybe from
in one year you will catch it no rush i know uh some of you maybe are are confused
i am speaking in two languages constantly
i would say
we need to use both sides of the brain
is also part of trying to catch the information behind the easiest way i was just saying
when i'm speaking in two languages
i'm doing explanations i i sound like a like a kindergarten teacher
but i guess is the normal
you try to explain in two languages don't think i'm treating you like kids just i'm i'm trying to explain as as best as i can explained the basis of the information of
10 days we will start to do the alignment okay to do the alignment for today let's go to read the information of today we are still in the first month of the year

its past without any judgment without any intentions allowing itself to love everything
was is
will be taking everything uh turn it into neutrality
love uh
uh loves everything

suddenly it just accept everything as it is
unconditionally it loves everything
it created
it is i am the spiritual life
today
we are going to do is to balance
energy of the soul in the crown
