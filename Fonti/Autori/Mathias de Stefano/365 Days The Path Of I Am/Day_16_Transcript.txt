hi everyone good morning good evening good night 
welcome to another alignment day 
i hope that the post today helps you to danger 
and to clarify some things so one of the things that i wanted to clarify from the post today 
is about our perception and 
it's been so long so much time that we had 
um [Music] have been taught about darkness as someone against us 
and [Music] reality 
darkness is just another creature that is evolving in this universe that we all are 
we cannot recognize the purpose of darkness until we face our own darkness 
our own things that we have within one of the main things that 
um we need to understand is that um 
we usually think that darkness is something against the light and 
and it's not like that darkness is not against light darkness 
is the distortion of light and this is something very important to understand 
that darkness is the distortion of light because we as humans 
used to we used to think to to to believe 
that everything is opposite that everything is just opposite to each other 
like positive negative no they are not opposite they are complementing 
uh one of the main things that helps to understand that um 
there is no forces in the universe that are against each other but all the 
forces are commendatory to each other um well that knowledge the acknowledging 
that will help us to realize that we we don't have to fight against anything 
that we just have to balance that 
one of the things that we that we are 
using to do um [Music] that that we 
are uh this this last period we are doing is to call ourselves like warriors 
warriors of light rainbow warriors and there's no war to fight 
we are not warriors i'm not a warrior um 
have come here for a different thing all the 
things that we have like fighting like um 
like uh yes like fighting um 
they are just a human perspective it's not the truth it's just a human perspective 
of fighting of trying to survive so one of the 
things why we fight or we are against each other is because we 
we fight to take control over the other ones and as i take control over the other 
ones is because i want to expand my territory and the reason why i want to expand my territory 
is because i want to have more things and i want to have things 
because i just want to 
have something to survive like food because i don't want to die 
everyone who is fighting basically is fighting 
for survival and there are many wars not only here on 
earth also in other constellations other [Music] 
dimensions not all the wars are fought with guns 
um or swords so it doesn't matter 
which war we are trying to fight um the last battle of all the battles 
is the one we have within is with ourselves 
and of course the only thing we have to fight for within is 
this war between our light and our darkness 
and as i said before the darkness is just the distortion of 
light so basically 
the war is the light fighting with itself 
in its different perspectives because darkness doesn't exist 
you don't need to find a balance between both of them because 
the darkness is just the light distortion distorted 
when we go towards our darkness they are 
there are just potentials that we had no idea how to use them properly 
any conflict and war that we have with ourselves within 
with someone in our environment or even the warrior between countries 
they are just potentials that has hadn't been 
really worked properly 
and it's normal for us that 
that we go into this path of evolution getting even more 
um confused because as more experiences we have more 
distortion so we lose the clarity once 
we realize that every darkness that we face in our lives 
are just our own light distorted we just realized that 
[Music] to be free we just need to lock our darkness 
to recognize it to honor it and to 
let the the light shine 
properly according to that darkness made us we make ourselves free 
from that all our history has brought us to 
believe that there are good things and bad things but the truth is that they are not 
things that are bad or that they are 
bad or good but there is only things unbalanced 
so the most important job that we have in our lives is to work with ourselves to achieve that 
i know it's difficult to accept most of the times that 
the most horrible facts and acts that 
used to happen in the society to accept the the 
worst thing that happens in our society the horrible facts uh because 
uh of course it's very difficult for us to understand why they happen 
and the truth is that there are no bad things by nature 
it starts to unbalance by the experience 
this is why our great possibility is to try to bring back the balance 
so i myself has have lived many of the darkness things 
demons possessions many things [Music] 
along my life and and uh 
i faced the darkness i i i know how they work i i know 
that they exceed they have force but 
um there was one day that 
i just felt them and i experienced 
the acknowledging of they are a part of me 
i cannot fight them because they are part of myself 
so i just talk to them and hug them and and say thank you i love you because now 
i understand that you are just showing me a part of myself that i couldn't see by myself 
and since that moment they don't bother me i sometimes feel them but don't bother 
because they are myself but then we have the other fight because 
fighting the outside sometimes is easier than fighting the inside which is to see 
your own darkness and how dark can you be to others 
that's more difficult it's very difficult 
to understand the darkness and how they work 
watching them from the side of the light because our normal perspective is to 
think that we are in the right side i guess that one of the 
uh best ways to understand how darkness and light works is touch planet the 
channel or maybe some discovery channel i don't know 
according to that um to that what i said of watching 
watching planet is like um you see 
two stories in one documentary uh one is the 
the deer and you see how they grow up and how they um i don't know you you just 
uh love the you just love the deer 
and how they grow up and also you see this the story of the lion and how the lion also mother 
and how the mother takes care of the of the child and of the of the lion 
uh the how do you say the the tiny lot 
i don't know the word in english um so um [Music] 
so you love with both of them because they had a cup cup 
they have amazing stories and they are beautiful and they you love both mothers 
and suddenly one of the mothers fights the other one and eats the child it's the 
deer and you just see everything you know in the documentary they show you everything the blood everything 
so suddenly you say who the guy here 
because the cop was hungry and he was about to die if he 
wouldn't eat anything so the mother went to look for lunch 
so who's the dark one when you watch nature 
you can just pretend that 
that thing that we believe is something cruel or 
is just an act of survival that's all what it is 
the people that makes terrible things that we say they are bad people 
they are just trying to survive and i am also 
talking about murderers rapers rapists um 
[Music] tyranny 
all the people that we usually say they are bad people 
they're all people that has suffered kids that have suffered when they were child 
people that weren't able to feel love to express their own truth 
people that were hurt it's people in the subconscious 
they believe and think that hurting others is the way of love 
and this is one of the most difficult teachings 
that even jesus even jesus 
said forgive them because they don't know what they are doing 
every every fact of 
evil is just a fact a matter of distortion 
so this is what what we are doing every day by the alignments 
is to try to balance to align that distortion 
so in order to help these distortions in the world 
with all these people that is distorted what we have to do is to start by our 
own distortion so i've seen many people asking but also 
the markers also this and this ever everyone they were all 
kids that were hurt 
okay so our goal is not to 
our goal is not to fight against what happened it's not to judge what happened 
is to heal ourselves so we allow 
the future not to happen in the future to be free from that 
so in order to make this possible in the future what we have to 
is to set ourselves free from the perception of fighting 
to forgive everyone in the past of everything that they did 
and to give love to the future's future children's 
you have to go through the same things 
it's very easy to put ourselves in the 
like judges of what is good and what is bad but 
it's not our task all this that i am speaking is important 
to make the alignment we are not connected to make a beautiful meditation whatever 
we are here to work with this so what we are going to align now 
is what we are speaking there's no need to integrate or accept 
this right now we have uh 
we have a lot of time a lot of um 
thousands of years if you want you will someday 
there's no rush someone asked even the network of people 
is doing pedophilia and 
eating children yes even them even them because if we are not 
recognizing that we are all one that we are all the same 
so we are not able to forgive so we are hating someone and we are inheriting 
this to our childs in the future to hate 
someone this is one of the most difficult tasks ever we call that compassion 
this is the most difficult thing but this is why we are here to try to 
align it and i'm taking my time to explain all this because 
the sacrament chakra is the one that absorbs 
all this all this pain all these beliefs 
all these emotions so remember 
that all darkness is just distortion 
of light if i am light and i bribe myself 
the distortion stops the vibration of today is 
so the sound which is h life and this sound 
is the represents the gestation the womb 
the statement of today is i am the generating life 
the code of today is the vibration e is not e 
with this vibration the singing and the voice originate 
with this sound it is beginning of the world 
the creative verve who with force elevates propelling the echoes of the cosmos like waves in the 
universal ocean is the truth coherence 
willingness to learn let's go to that 
sorry if i am like weird i'm not tired or or distracted just every day i'm just 
coming more in myself and my higher self is not like me i 
i have humor a lot so on but he he doesn't he's more straight 
i am more so 
this is why i am more like that i'm kind of putting both of them 
together so that's it 
take a deep breath 
i can massage softly to my body 
to thank to be the anchor of my higher self 
i just focus in my breathing 
[Music] take a deep breath relax in the body 
[Music] 
i feel the oxygen [Music] 
through my lungs my heart blood muscles and organs 
[Music] 
[Music] 
breathe in i feel the heat 
coming out of my body i become aware 
of the hottest party 
i observe the color of this heat 
surrounding all my aura 
breathe in 
[Music] i recognize all the things that i did 
today 
and take a moment to feel the emotions related to each one of them 
what is the emotion that i felt the most today 
i take with my hands all these emotions these colors 
this hot 
and i bring them all around my hip 
all around the sacrum 
i visualize the wheel the circle 
i allow myself to feel the heat around 
i take a moment to recognize that in this part of my body 
i can find the engine that creates every one of my emotions 
[Music] 
is the center of my creation 
[Music] 
without judgment i allow myself to feel 
each one of these emotions 
the ones that nourish me the ones that represent a weight for me 
[Music] 
[Music] is here 
within my intestines [Music] 
where the inner battle is hell 
[Music] is here where the forces of light and darkness 
create all the energy that makes me be who i am 
both of them are my creative potential 
[Music] 
[Music] my capacity to create 
depends on the balance in these two forces 
as these two forces are finished within me 
i would waste all the energy that i have unnecessarily 
[Music] 
both forces are the generators of my life 
i recognize right now that both of them pushes me 
towards action 
without judgment i allow myself to feel around me 
all these people all these persons 
that i believe they are my enemies in this life 
[Music] 
i just allow myself to feel them [Music] 
they could be very close people to you or famous people in the world 
or people from other dimensions 
[Music] 
without judgment 
i perceive that the emotions that they reflect they are my inner 
demons they are my fear 
my sorrow my hatred 
[Music] but again these emotions 
they only live within me they don't live on them 
[Music] 
is my energy the one that pushes them to be the shadows of my life 
[Music] take a deep breath 
[Music] 
ah [Music] 
[Music] i become aware that is their darkness 
their shadows and emotions provoked on me 
that pushes me to look for the light 
to transcend to begin my own path 
is there darkness [Music] that is guiding you towards the light 
we're only able to see your inner light because of their darkness 
is this crisis and conflict what makes me creative 
[Music] for i get enlightenment 
when i achieve the resolution to that conflict 
[Music] and i can only transcend this 
by honoring my masters [Music] 
they are just acting because of my need of transcendence 
so i descend the i am to my sacrum 
and i say to myself i can forgive the darkness 
i can't find the balance between the light and darkness 
[Music] i can't forgive myself 
[Music] for creating this darkness [Music] 
i recognize myself as the beautiful child 
of my fathers and mothers light and darkness [Music] 
i am the result of my emotions 
therefore i can be my own generator of life 
take a deep breath and still pronounce the vibration of the day 
making the wheel spin faster and faster each time 
until it swallowed by the light of the sacrum chakra 
[Music] 
[Music] um 
[Music] 
i keep pronouncing it i feel the heat as i pronounce the sound 
the irradiation of the brighter chakra 
i feel the expansion of the creator of my emotions 
i feel the inner light 
even more brighter taking the light 
to every direction and bringing clarity to the 
darkness so take a deep breath 
and pronounce i am the generator 
of life [Music] 
i am the narrator of life i am 
the generator of life 
[Music] i expand my light with my son 
expanding towards all the network the matrix 
watching all these beautiful lights like mine 
[Music] the wounds intestines 
shining [Music] all over here and now 
um the matrix the creator 
i can't forgive the darkness i can 
forgive my own darkness i can live 
imbalance between dark and light 
for i am the generator of life 
i take my hands to my heart 
i recognize the love light and of darkness 
as a father and a mother 
[Music] 
i honor both forces within me [Music] 
with all my unconditional love 
and i start to bring all the love my heart 
through all my body stretching caressing 
yawning and opening my eyes slowly 
[Music] 
come back here and now to recognize that i myself created the darkness 
thank you for thank you for being there and 
being part of the network and see you tomorrow at the same time 
rest a lot bye - Generated with https://kome.ai
