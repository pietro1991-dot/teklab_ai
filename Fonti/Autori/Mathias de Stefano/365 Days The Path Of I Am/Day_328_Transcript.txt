hi everyone good morning good afternoon good evening 
to all of you two days to 
finish with Gemini two days to begin with the last of our 
the last month of our path 
let's begin with the topic for today which is history 
when I say history um domestic story even if it has the same 
etymology it has a different option of uh description okay so don't 
take it as story take it as history okay 
but anyway we will we will see how they connect because they have the same 
entomology so first of all let's try to re-signify 
what history means because um for sure when we say history everyone 
starts to think about the past like history is something that 
it's located behind us if we perceive that we are the present so everything 
that came before is what we relate to the Past which is history for us but 
um that concept is not precisely uh when we try to understand what is 
um history so that's why we will go as always to 
the origin of the word so the word history comes from this verb 
which is oida um that means to see 
to see something and this word gives this other word which is 
that means idea so why is this relation between the C 
and idea because the word oida that describes the verb to see to see 
something outside it's related to Imaging to an image so 
everyone can understand that when you see something you see the image the shape of the 
things so when you close your eyes and you create like an image inside trying 
to memorize so outside you are creating a mental 
image so that mental image is what we call an idea so these two words are strictly related 
because of imagination this is why oida and oidea 
is a mental image okay 
from this word we have this word hoister 
Tor means the subject the guide that is doing the action 
so hoistor the wise 
the wise one the one that has idea 
has the idea that also give us the word 
Witness so is the one that have seen something 
and has an idea from what that person saw okay 
if I want to type the attribute of this wise person that has witnessed what 
happened and that has an idea of what happened we will call it hoistoria 
which is the attribute of the wise person that is the witness of things 
that he saw historia [Music] 
and this is the word that gives origin to our word history 
so I guess that is really important to understand the history of history of the 
word history because we can change our point of view from believing that history is a 
measurement of things through time towards the concept of acknowledging 
things that happened to realize 
about the things that that we um Incorporated from what happened when 
what we acknowledge so history is not related to what happened 
is related to what I know that happened and of course because of this is related 
to The Experience is the experience that made me Witness 
of what happened so the reason why history tend to be 
called history as something that you can measure Through Time 
it's because of what happened to science in the 16th 
century which is the um the beginning of the met the 
scientists the scientific method which is something that stopped the idea of 
um measuring the things of reality according to the subject and they 
started to to explain the things through objects which means this in the experimentation 
you have to make an experiment so you can prove that this is real but it's not 
from the point of view of the subject you have to do many tests in many different ways and many 
proof that you are right the scientific method says that it should not be 
something subjective it should be something objective that tells you that 
something is true when historians took that scientific method they stopped 
being storytellers that told the things that they knew that they saw that they remember and they began to be 
people that were trying to objectively explain how things happen so 
that's why they start to measure time in facts and that's why also the history uh 
turned out to be something also scientific and stop being something 
subjective so what happened here that 
the facts started to be organized in a line so we started to 
call history something that you can measure in a 
in a Time and this is when 
the whole change of the concept of History 
so what we started to do with histories the scientifical uh point of view is 
that we stopped we started to see history in a very 
objective way as something that we have to study which is outside as an object 
that we have to analyze and we stop living as a very human thing from our daily 
life we separate ourselves from history we started to see and measure time 
history in a line in a point of view that 
we can study it not being rude to those facts 
as in the science happen um in the method happened that we 
started to to see the scientific method we start to make the experiments trying to be out of 
our human touch because we uh we wanted to have a very objective results so uh 
science said that if we are involved we could change the result of the experiment the same happened with 
history we started to measure history from the outside in a very cold way so 
we are not involved in that and we can send the actual facts of what happened 
so what happened when we studied the history in that way is that people start to see the facts 
but what they see is not actually what happened because you are not feeling it 
you will understanding the environment of why those things happen so you so we 
are not really interacting with the idea of the facts that were happening because 
we are looking at from the outside so when we start to see in a very 
scientific way the history suddenly there are many facts that you 
cannot really explain because you are not living that in that moment and used 
to actually take him some history some stories according to what you what that discover 
from when the tools that they had objectively but because they are not 
engaging with that real history you can lose many data and just 
taking only one side of the story like for example here the pyramids 
what historians used to do is to study history for example the pyramids they 
don't study really the pyramids they study what the history told them what 
are the pyramids what is around the pyramids what other people 
has told and this is not because historians wants 
to lie to us or whatever no it's just because 
they just see the tools that they have around the facts and they don't live the 
fact actually I will try to make a drawing to understand this 
is 
I don't know if you will get it because there are so many so many lines 
okay 
let's go to these to this Frame here 
so first of all let's go through here we have the construction of the pyramid in a certain period of time we have the 
construction of the pyramid and In This Moment the people that were living here they were telling the stories orally 
they were just speaking the stories because they were not used in symbols to write they were telling the stories 
singing the stories the story the history of how it was built which 
eventually in this other period of time which in a period of time we have this story as mythology 
because here people are not historians storytellers they tell stories they 
narrate the things so the people can listen and remember the stories this is 
why they don't tell the actual story they just tell mythology they just 
explain things as they felt how they were Generations throughout through 
generations after Generations so this mythology arrives into our current time as fiction 
so we don't believe any more in mythology and we think that mythology 
was a real way in which they believed but it was just a story to understand 
the history so from our point of view today believing that is fiction 
for them it was a story but they had a different way to tell the story it was 
not it is not like us today we have a different tell the story they explain 
history through Concepts and stuff like they were very 
um abstract so that for us is fiction but it is it doesn't mean that it was 
just uh fake ideas it was the way in which they are able to translate that history 
in the in their time so now in the Egyptian period this is 
atlantium period now we have the Egyptian period what we have is the Reconstruction of the pyramids and all 
the temples around so this new culture that the the Egyptian culture it will do is to 
narrate to describe what they were seeing and they will they won't describe what happened before they will describe 
how greater is what they are doing now they will describe everything that they 
were rebuilding reconstructing and they mix that with mythology 
so they describe how it was the Reconstruction of the 
pyramids okay 
so what happened after this after the this period we have erosion so the pyramid starts to break 
they they start to to get like this as we see them today but in middle in this 
Middle Point we have another cultures which was the Greek Roman times in the 
Greek Roman times the historians were very different from the historians from 
today the historians in the Greek Roman time they thought that in order to honor 
history you needed to rebuild the structures you need to rebuild the 
things and paint it again and so on so this is why some of the places that we 
they are exactly as the Roman and and Greek people left it not as the ancient 
people left it because they remade them um remain to everything 
okay so it's very different from the point of view of history in the 18th century that 
they thought you should be objective you should be uh 
if you find a plan you have to leave it exactly as you find it as you found it because you have to 
honor the history not touching the history so it's a very opposite point of 
view of how the Greek Romans used to take history 
so um the difference between the Greek Roman times and ancient cultures 
regarding history in front of our point of view of history since the 
18th century is that the Roman uh the the Greek Roman culture believed the 
time was a circle so the ancient cultures they said if time is a circle 
everything must be recycled so this is why we started to they in 
that time they started to remake every Temple that they found because for them it was the natural way 
of doing time you need to remake once and again in the cycles 
but in the 18th century with the vision of time 
as a line but they thought is that you you should 
not touch history you should as you found it because you have to tell the 
history and not mixed the times so we stopped believing time is a cycle we 
don't recycle history and we just leave it as it was in the past it's a different vision of time 
according to different periods of of cultures 
so one of the ways in which the present 
finds out what happened in the past is through the text 
that they found or the Traditions that they listened and they try to 
reconstruct history so basically it's about what 
they read from what they found and what they found and they are reading 
is basically what they have written what they wrote in the past about the 
things what they saw so this is why 
is very difficult to believe exactly the history of all the of each one of the 
countries because what we actually do with history is to read the story 
according to the people that wrote where they lived 
which is not the actual truth it's just their point of view just take it as an 
example like we are trying to investigate happening in the and in the Second World War 
and um and there's no books from that time and there are things that we found 
written were written by a Nazi so what we could read from the from the 
Second World War would be basically very different from what 
really happened if we only read the text from these people 
so this is why when we look into history and the historian says we read in a text 
from 3000 years ago that they did this and that and that 
you cannot assure that that's really what happened because what they are reading is actually what someone was 
able to write but it's not the actual truth 
so basically we have another way to compare if what we are reading is 
real which is the test of carbon 14. 
foreign but carbon 14 is only in the things that 
are um organic like bones like tissues or these 
kind of things so you can only uh compare the age 
of the things according to if they have this chemical so they make 
the test of the bodies that they found around the pyramid and maybe they found the tone of someone that said I worked 
here in the pyramid as an architect so they found the bone they make that 
and the test says 2 400 BC 
so if the bones are from 2 400 BC and the 
text says that that person was an architect so by deduction 
they say they appear in that period of time 
the just as deduction so also a third way in which you can 
interpret history is through sediments so geologists can tell you around in 
which periods of time these things happened because of the erosion because some chemicals and elements sorry like 
um like carbon like um Iron they accumulate in such a way in a process 
that can take thousands of years so they can relate in which amount of time it 
was given that process now what usually happen is that all 
these uh branches like the geologists the architect um the the historian they don't usually 
work together they do their work by state so this is why sometimes we have 
a lot of lacks in the gaps in in history 
because uh they don't work together they do their own job and they don't think 
in the whole this is one of the things that we have lost 
when we decided to see history as a line instead of a hole 
like a complete circle so for example one of the things that 
happened usually is that the historians that work here for 
example the egyptologists they work with Egypt and they don't ask themselves why there 
are pyramids in China and in Mexico or the people in Mexico maybe they don't ask themselves why there are pyramids in 
other parts of the world they just study what they have in their territory so we have a lack of 
of connection of many different people working for the same history 
people that is not historian is is many other disciplines all together 
as we have seen this point of view of History in this way 
in a line take us to to a point in which we cannot relate 
with what happened in history really what people has were living because we 
are seeing just the objective things so when we just base ourselves in the 
objective things we cannot relate with the idea the Deep idea of things 
usually for example in Egypt what we have is 
the idea that they were polytastics that believed in many gods 
um that they had many different beliefs 
but actually when you look into the mythology of of Egypt you will find out that 
the reason why they had so many gods is because they were honoring each one of the aspects of the Divine not because 
they just believe in many gods there was something behind it that if you don't live an experience 
that you will just see images and you will just see 
gods and foreign people with animal hands 
and that's it so that's what they brought to us that's why they 
explained to us about history 
so from this we can understand now that history has two point of views to be 
seen one objective the other one subjective 
so from the objective point of view of History 
the different situations facts of History 
from the subjective point of view of History we can try to understand 
what this situations and facts bring me 
to do something what they advise me to do 
so from the point of view so so when we go to school when we go to 
um when we study history at school usually 
we see this point of view the objective point of view in which we position ourselves in the present look behind 
towards the past trying to see what happened and 
is actually useless to see the history in this way because it's kind of like 
you are trying to know all the different things that happened that none of them 
can affect you because they all went away so you are just concerned about the 
future and to know all this is just like a burden 
people used to say it's important to know history if you want to change the future is important to recognize the 
roots of your story but what for 
the the thing is that when we see the history in this way 
to know the history is basically just useless this is just about knowledge about just accumulating 
data and that's it foreign so when we start to see the history in a 
very subjective way we start to change our point of view 
because now the facts that we were learning in a line 
are coming back to us because the history is not something outside of US history is within us we are the product 
of History we are made of History each one of our cells has the knowledge has 
the memory of what happened so whatever we want to do in the future will do it with the tools that we got in 
the past so to know our history to recognize and understand our history is 
to understand that we have in order to change the future to do something transcendental 
it's not about learning a line of what happened is about learning what happened 
to me to my body to my family tree to my history to know what is within me 
okay so remember that history 
is equals to wise 
Witness 
wise witness because history is about what you have experienced what you have 
lived in your life that it is about 
ability to with with your own experience to have lived 
history so next time that you 
will look for history and try to understand something from the past I recommend you to 
just ask yourself about Which history you have with them 
to wonder the answers that you have in yourselves 
so whenever you go to look for that history 
you will absorb it much more better because 
you will ReSound it within so remember history is not something 
that happened before of us history is the actual life 
is within us is something that is part of us and that 
is is for us to create 
to do new things 
so it's actually living we are living history 
the vibration today is cool the statement today is I am a product of my 
history the code today is again another one of 
the names of the 12 families of Atlantis that took care of the portals of the 
planet so in honor to them we say their name
