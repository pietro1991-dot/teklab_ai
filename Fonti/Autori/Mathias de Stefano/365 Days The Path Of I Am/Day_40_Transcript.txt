hi everyone good morning good evening good night uh I did everything to try to organize my curly hair
I couldn't
you can laugh freely there's no way to put them down
just to tell you since yesterday
I
I ended the alignment um I I felt like very weird physically
I still am I I feel like my head is like three times bigger right
so something
I discovered today was
my mind is very relaxed
my body is very stressed
this is something
maybe we all can be feeling
I would like to explain a little bit about
before we keep going maybe it is useful for you too remember
these days we've been speaking
um the
vibration
wave of vibration divided in different frequencies we have one
is low vibration or low frequency
is like the past the other one medium
is like the present
the other one
goes faster the
high vibration
would be future
um remember we have compare the uh the vibration as water
this water can be also in three aspects
would be the solid aspect of water the liquid
the gas
um these three uh aspects uh
we had related with time with space with the vibration with the water
not all in just are not only just for those aspects
also for the being
um the Bing can be also related with the solid aspect
we call um the body
the medium act
is the liquid aspect um
is the soul the motion
then we have the other one the high vibration uh the gas also
we can relate in the self with the spiritual
um we can relate the aspect of of the of the self okay the physical the body the soul
the spirit with the three aspect of the water the solid the liquid
the gas
also with the vibration
would be the low the medium
the high vibration
also with time past present
future
also the space uh High weight
depth
if you can picture
this is these states are related with the states of vibration see I will take the idea of the last thing
I said
basically
I was saying is
since everything
we have spoken everything
exists is divided in like a trinity aspect okay
water time space um the being everything is Trinity
we can also relate the
Trinity with the different states of vibration
picture
the body has a low vibration the soul has a medium vibration
the spirit has a high vibration
remember the self the being the three of them are the same thing is the same vibration vibrating in different frequencies
it's just oneself one vibration vibrating in a in a low frequency in the body medium frequency in the soul
high frequency in the spirit
what happened
we live in a physical body
only looking into the physical aspect our life is very slow very slow the process takes a lot of time
the soul
is like the medium aspect of the vibration uh
means the energy of the body
is
we ex we experience the chakras
the the rainbow of colors um the soul is is able to leave the process in a shorter period
they could um the the bulk can can feel
experience many emotions in a short period of time maybe in just one day
the spirit goes
fast
it can't see the whole process it can understand the whole process of everything
happens uh to the body
the soul
it's
fast
cannot experience feel to um it cannot leave the process
the body
the Soul are living we usually we call to
like the physic the um the motion
the mind taking the spirit from the spiritual level we can call it just mind uh in order to to bring the the spirit into a more worthy concept uh not
spiritual we should be um we can call it mine uh the soul we can call it emotion
the body we just can call it physics
body limiteds the concept of um of just one body
the physics is talking about the nature of it
when we are speaking about the physics or the body the the emotion or the soul the mind or the spirit we are just talking about different aspects of frequency of yourself hmm the Mind vibrates
it has a
fast diversion
so fast um frequency high frequency
it is able to to understand the things faster than soul in the motion
the motion is faster to process something than the physics the mind is the one able to just read a text
say yes I understand
now it's
easy
thing is related with
thing
happened with
thing
has happened
and
is going to make
other thing happen in the future
I can just pick it up
this
the Mind took the idea maybe in two days or three days the emotion comes up
suddenly you start to realize
what you just discover
acknowledge you start to feel it
suddenly you start to feel about the past
saying oh
I get it
my mind told me um I
I'm remembering about the things of the past
I know
if I am not letting go something from the past
memories
I have I cannot move forward
you start to feel sad or emotional about all the things
you have lived
you are not sure if you want to leave it away you start to make the process emotionally usually maybe one month later or two months later suddenly you get a cold
you get a fever
you have to be in bed with temperature
you're just shaking in the bed
will
asking for medicine
you have no idea
because it's summer
you have an idea
I got ill
that's your body
just received information from the soul two months ago ago
from the spirit two months
two days
the reason
the body receives the information in a long time
the soul received the motion
the mind is
the body is vibrating very low low vibration
the minds see or think just get recorded in the unconscious
the subconscious like
this is test by the emotion within the energy within
in the next days you will keep feeling it you will start to feel it
maybe in some month or a year it arrives to the body
this is uh we we can we can see it like
this is the process of the spirit the process of the Soul
then the rest of the room is the process of the body
is
we start to feel in our bodies
changes of
we are doing in the emotional level
the mental level very far away in time
this is
along
whole year we are working 10 days first with the mind to understand it
10 days with the soul
we could integrate it
then 10 days with the body to manifest it did you get date of
we are following
structure of the of the year
this is
the body takes a long process
it vibrates very low
it's not bad
it vibrates low it exists
it vibrates low
this is
some sometimes we could hear
if we start to vibrate very high with the spirit the body gets transfigurated um
the body starts to vibrate
fast
it gets enlighted
this is not
the body is just living away towards the spirit is
body itself vibrating in a higher frequency is the spirit
this is something
we need to understand
the spiritual level is not something different from the physical level is not something apart the physical aspect is just the low vibration of the spirit
this is
um sometimes we can start to perceive a month or even more later um the the the work
we are doing by talking
talking hmm it will be felt in uh in some time
um we are speaking
right
because it has happened um a month already
for sure we are start starting to feel it huh
not always the change is felt like something bad uh
usually we feel like tired or heavy
when the body gets the process of transformation it it goes through a process of uh hibernation okay
so
is
you feel like heavy or like
after uh a work a process of of inner work is normal to be tired
when we sleep is the moment
the body gets the at the transformation
also sometimes we have to recognize
fever um is good for
too
culturally we we have
uh
concept of fever as if it is an illness or something bad
we need to take out
it's not like
fever is a process of purge of the body okay of course if you have more than 40 degrees is bad
normally
normally fever is something
purges the body from all the toxins
all the viruses
bacteria
everything
you don't okay
it helps with Evolution making more um making your body more strong
don't worry about having
fever sometimes if it doesn't get to the 40 degrees okay
I know some people
usually
have like 37 degrees or not even 37 degrees of fever they exactly at
moment says I need medicine to to get
down
um
no no no no no if it gets to 39
a half okay let's take it down
uh leave the fever to work okay to make The Purge of your body it's like another Kundalini
all
process of these 10 days ends with the word acceptance
this is
everything
we have worked everything
we are doing goes through the process um the process is to uh is to accept everything
happens
um for most of us it's very difficult to accept
we have many misunderstandings of
acceptance mean um
and also a lot of uh Prejudice about all the reality
this is
it's
important to understand
is acceptance
first of all let's try to understand the main idea
we have about acceptance
is
we usually think
to accept something is related to the outside
that's
we usually say um I have to accept the reality I have to accept
everything is a mess I have to accept these people
I don't like I have to accept the world as it is blah blah look at
is we naturally we naturalize the idea
we have to accept things
we don't like
usually people say it's like
you you just have to accept it
we have created
idea of acceptance
is
has a uh
is
related is much more related with the concept of defeat
it's almost like if you have to
when you say I have to accept it it's kind of like if you have to surrender
we we have we have been living our last 100 years in a competition due to the uh to the globalization
the capitalism from
the socialism took many ideas too the capitalistic concept of acceptance is to surrender against
reality
we should not they say we should not we are
to win we have projected
concept of the outside Within
if Society doesn't accept me
maybe I'm wrong
I don't accept myself
it happens exactly the same towards the within
is I cannot accept myself
I'm not good enough
we say I cannot accept
reality outside is a mirror in I cannot accept
reality Within is exactly the same
we talk about acceptance It's Not About just to take the things
as they are
don't do anything for it we have to talk about the original concept of acceptance
the origin of the word acceptance comes from the Latin at captain
means to catch something okay to catch something
is
look
it has nothing nothing uh is not related at all with
we believe acceptance means
what is the correct meaning of acceptance is to take something as it is recognize it observe it
when I know exactly
it is I put everything of me to transform it into another level transcendental level nobody wins nobody lose
as an example I maybe can say I refuse to accept
this reality exists I refused to to say
this exists even we refuse to accept
reality the reality exists we are
I can touch myself I'm
you are
I can touch everything
it exists for example um if I decide to accept
the reality exists I accept it it means
I will take the reality
I will study the reality I will try to understand the reality I will look into the reality as deep as I can
then I will figure out
the reality is made up with atoms
the atoms are made up with Quantum
suddenly
is void
suddenly there's nothing
oh it was right reality doesn't exist yeah it doesn't exist
in order to figure
out you had to accept the reality first otherwise you wouldn't make the process to figure it out
acceptance is not just to accept the things as they are acceptance is to take
reality to go deeper into
reality
to show yourself
everybody
you can take something new out of
reality
it's exactly the same outside
inside to accept myself
to accept others
somebody says accept the world as it is they are not saying the reality word is not saying to don't do anything is to say accept the world as it is
it is like
you can it's already like
so you have to accept it you cannot deny it
you can go study the history
the words is like
I can understand the world the process of the world
by understanding
the word the world works
I can try to change it
first I need to understand it to accept it
what was to accept it was to take it
to observe it from very close
this with everything with everything
exists see
is like in our normal lives saying I can't accept
there is poverty
then you don't do anything for the poor people you just I I can't accept it
it's like okay I go I analyze the povert deputy I look into the poverty I realize maybe through history
poverty is not only
of rich people okay maybe it's
are other causes causes for
and once I understood every one of the causes
I can recognize okay maybe I can do something
now I understand
I exists the poverty
basically not to accept
that exists is
to deny things is just like you're not helping to change the reality
one I I used to I can say for example
to the spiritual world to all the spiritual people
usually deny the existence of
reality
in the other hand to the scientific people the ones
doesn't believe in anything to remind them
the movement of science started to question
to look for the answers not to deny realities
is not by denying
you get to the truth
both of these worlds the spiritual World denying the reality
they believe in another magical things
the scientific world
denies the other realities just
they believe in
they see to accept is to be opened to the possibilities of every reality
in order to do
we have to start with ourselves
take your notebook
write down
do you accept of yourself
what you cannot accept of yourself tomorrow we start with the emotional week
I would love to see you all crying no need for
so today we work with the Taurus that's the vibration of the day the statement for today is I am the the Emissary of Eternity the code of today is the spiritual pattern new that's the sound yeah the moment of transcendence arrives letting go everything
the spirit has given
received by allowing itself to go out into the universe expanding to infinite to Infinity Limitless empowering from all
was separated unifying itself in the governance of its consciousness in the law injection
balance
we start to massage the body to caress the body stretch yawn I give
to the body for being the anchor of the spirit undermined in the matter
I focus very deep in my breathing feel
the air the oxygen comes within through your nose lungs heart blood organs
muscles I allow myself to feel the heat within my body
how it goes out through my skin filling up my aura
all my magnetical feel
above my head the light of the I am foreign with each breathing I bring all the Heat
the energy around my body towards the I am the higher self as a spiral fit in
light making it brighter
brighter I allow myself to bring the light of the I am through all my body take a deep breath third eye throw hard plexus sacrament yes knees
feet I feel the light of the I am within my body taking all the information from the mind
we have worked with all these the 10 days aside feel
I am touching all
information I recognize
what it is really doing is to accept all the information
is within me I feel hell for my feet the Energy starts to go out going up
around my body as an egg of light surrounding me coming again to my head I use my hands if needed to touch it to feel it
help it to get to my crown I am I am I accept
I am all around my magnetical field
is the information of everything
makes me
I am
the light of the I am the Consciousness allows me to accept
I am take a deep breath
I start to make the sound the vibration
comes from my body towards all the directions towards the eternity of my being hmm foreign take a deep breath
taking a deep breath I recognize saying it to words all the directions
Eternity of myself
I am the emissary of Eternity I am the Emissary of Eternity I am the Emissary of Eternity I am the Emissary of Eternity take a deep breath
we take our hands to our hearts I recognize
the only way to transform
I am is by accepting
I am there's no way to transform myself into something different fight first to love myself accept myself recognize myself I accept
I am
and
I accept who I am Here
Now I am the Emissary of Eternity I am the Emissary of Eternity I am the Emissary of Eternity
