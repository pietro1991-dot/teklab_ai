what for 
[Applause] [Music] 
you [Music] 
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] 
[Music] thank you [Music] 
hi everyone good morning good afternoon 
good evening 
just to to let you know um this I I wanted to show you uh 
um to show you this because it's incredible and important in many ways 
um and um just to let you know what it was 
um this is the golden parade of the Pharaohs and it's because today 
Egypt was um was taking the 25 around 25 pharaohs 
queens and kings from the ancient Egypt from the old Museum 
uh in in the in central Cairo to the new 
Museum of ancient civilizations so it is really it was really special 
really really amazing I was trying to show you as much as I could well I hope 
I hope you could see it a little bit and of course it was uh good in many reasons 
so it was a really good example of honoring the past 
so let's begin with the short explanation 
the topic for today very related to any point of view 
that you want to take the question for today is what for 
what for remember that what comes from guo in in 
the European language that means a thing concrete thing that we are going to 
speak about and then four comes from the word the Latin word Pro 
that means ahead something that is in front 
so um what for what for is the question 
that speaks about the future of things the goal of the things that we do so we 
have to remember one of the laws of the universe of the universe which is cause and effect so the question why is the one that goes 
to the origin to the causes of the things and the question what four is the 
one that goes to the effects of the things to the Future aspects of of 
something um so 
um remember that yesterday when we spoke about the um 
the the question why I explained that it was related to the 
uh the origin of things so we have to go to the causes of all things so as much 
you go to the origin you will find the very 
beginning and the Very original cause of all things and that means that before that there's nothing 
is the Eternal origin so this means that there is no other origin or cause to that main cause and 
this means that there is no past and no present in the beginning of the universe 
this means that the first time existing is the future the future is all the 
possibilities of that cause so when you reach the very origin of all 
the causes you can only find possibilities that comes from that cause 
from that origin and that's why the next question that someone must do is what 
for which is regarding the future the future of things 
the question what for is the one that allows us to find different 
possibilities and different perspectives of one answer 
without the question what for we wouldn't be able to find new ways to 
transform ourselves to change so the question what for is a key that 
allows us to move forward towards the future so when we think about the future when 
we usually do is to relate the goal of the future with 
success and when we think about success is because we start to believe that 
the main goal of everything in our life is to achieve our goals and to find the 
purpose of what we are seeking for so when we speak about success this 
means that we consider success those things that we are looking for like success can be to have money success can 
be to raise to to reach the top of the mountain success can be uh to be able to 
connect with yourself through meditation as success could be I don't know 
um [Music] to reach peace inner peace or whatever 
so from this point of view to achieve a success can be seen from different point of 
views it's not it is from the from the mental from the emotional from the 
physical way so is to achieve a goal that we have in our lives 
so the reason why we think about success in a different way is because we live in a world that have been using the 
capitalistic idea of um um 
the capitalistic idea for globalization according to 
um competition uh is much more about 
um um going um to be over the other ones to to reach 
things physical things to have um these competition so 
um we can have all of course a capitalism that is organic but we don't 
have an organic capitalistic capitalism today we have a capitalism according to 
competition um so this is why we relate success the big the people that that is in the 
spiritual path or in a much more social path um 
we can we can usually think about success as 
something that is wrong or something that is bad but for the people that lives in a society like 
ours today um is is not is is good 
but we have a great mistake regarding the word success because in 
our society we consider success as a destiny a place where we have to go 
to something to reach when success really means at Point 
from where you get out [Music] so the concept the concept of success 
comes from the etymology sequence sequence is the one that follows 
a sequency of things so success is something that is under other thing and 
it keeps going and keeps following something new so it's not related to 
Rich one place but to follow and keep moving from one place to another that's 
what it means really success in Spanish we have the word exito to 
describe success which is the same origin of the word exit in English so exit is from where 
you where you go out so it's not something that you reach is from where you go 
so this speaks um that we have this misunderstanding of 
um uh of uh success as being something that 
you reach that you have um when really is the one that is that 
is telling you that in order to be better you have to transform yourself and to keep moving 
not to stay in one spot so the one that has really success is the one that transforms constantly itself 
so once we understand the concept of 
um success we can really get the point the idea of 
the question what for the question what for is the one that 
helps me to move forward and to transform myself in questions like 
um um I want or or in statements like I 
want to be rich so the question would be what for and I don't know the answer to be 
free or to be happy so the question is 
what for and you keep asking what for once and again once and again so the way 
the reason why you do this is the same reason why you asked why you ask why to 
the Past you go back and back and back looking for the 
origin of things in the past asking why so what for you ask in order to find the 
answer for the purpose as much you ask what for to everything that you want to 
do you reach the idea of the purpose the question what for and the idea of 
success are really one for another why is this because 
the the main concept of of success is to 
move forward and the main concept an idea of the question what for is to make 
you doubt in that objective that goal that you had in your life so 
when you ask what for what for to each one of of of 
your goals in life you allow yourself to transform 
the goal of success so you are really succeeding in your life because you are 
transcending the previous idea so 
thanks to the question what for we set ourselves free from the idea 
of um from the idea uh of this goal of being success 
successful so we set ourselves free so we can keep moving keep transforming 
ourselves and not being stuck in the past 
in one only idea so as I said it's really 
important for us to ask ourselves 
what for in order to evolve in our life 
so now the question what for has two different aspects one 
connotation which is conditional and another connotation that is 
unconditional so remember what is condition condition 
is something that comes from the Latin con di kit which means something that is 
said by all of us something that we have decided by speaking together 
so a condition means that we already said something 
and we decided that this is in this way and we cannot change it [Music] um 
so why it is in conditional and conditional is something that wasn't 
spoke by many and it doesn't really matter what it was 
said is really free from all the perspectives from everything that was said so now let's go to the Linguistics 
do you remember what it's what it is a conditional when you write a sentence 
um I don't know if we are going back to school so 
taking you back to language um school 
um let's understand what is a conditional in language 
is all the sentences that you write with if 
okay if so for example I'm gonna do this if I do that 
I can go that place if I go first this place 
I will do this if I first accomplished that 
so a conditional is that you are going to do something you're 
going to do something if there's another thing 
that allows you to like there must be something 
more that allows you to do um to do what you are aiming to do 
um so that's a conditional they put the music even time louder 
so now how can we see this conditional in the what for 
when we say for example [Music] 
what um I don't know how to make a sentence sorry 
the music is making me um so 
um [Music] what is this goal for 
um if [Music] if at the end 
everything is the same what to say for 
if never listen so 
this kind of questions like you are trying to [Music] 
um um this kind of questions that you are trying to ask yourself what for 
why do this for if 
it will never change if it will never happen or this kind of 
things so those questions are made from the ego the conditional is from the ego 
so the ego speaks in conditional because the ego is trying to find the is is 
trying to take the control of all things so the inconditional way of asking what 
for is like that person that is willing to learn how to do things 
that is open to all the possibilities and that does the question what is this 
for what is that for 
but those questions are in order to find to figure out new ways of doing things 
[Music] so we could say that the what for in a conditional way is from an is a question 
from an adult that is frustrated in the things that 
that person is doing and the unconditional what for is that kid that 
is willing to learn a new way of doing things 
so now I leave you this question from where 
do you do the question what for from the condition or the unconditioned 
you have to make yourself the question so I invite you to write the questions 
all the questions that you have within that starts with platform 
foreign just write the questions doesn't matter 
the answer just the questions [Music] 
and also when you write these questions try to think from where are you writing 
them are you writing them to be successful 
on a purpose in your life reaching a goal or are you writing down 
these questions in order to transform transcend 
evolve go beyond and 
be sincere with your questions and answers because I don't really care what are 
your answers this is not an exam so I don't really care is your problem 
but you have to figure it out um just be sincere with yourself 
um for example today I wrote that my questions in the 
blog I wrote my what four in the blog and of course that they were from the 
ego because [Music] um it was conditional I figured out when as 
I was writing them so you can judge me because it's public but I'm not gonna read your notes 
so don't fool yourself be sincere with yourself because I don't really care I I 
don't care if you say uh yes I I am unconditional 
um because I'm looking for Transcendence I I don't really care 
[Music] I don't care this is not an exam this is not 
of being good or being bad no this is just to see how you 
have with them with yourself so figure out for your own self 
okay no need to show it to Any teacher 
so let's read information for today [Music] 
the vibration for today is gay the statement for today is I am 
coherence vision the code for today is the constellation of boots 
in its heart this constellation guards the second brightest 
star on the firmament are tourists its history is the one of the peasant 
that hurts auxins this means Taurus guiding them so that
