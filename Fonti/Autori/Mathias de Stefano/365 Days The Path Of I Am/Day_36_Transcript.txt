hi everyone good morning good evening good night i hope
finds you well i hope you're feeling good
that we all are very well aligned with
month i imagine
since yesterday you were able to contemplate observe
analyze each one of your attachments
if you couldn't as always step by step take your time
first of all
we start i just want to tell you
yesterday i just discovered the comments below the videos in youtube
i had no idea about all the comments um below below the youtube videos
i just wanted to thank you for all the for all the comments all the good vibes
everything
you are writing
uh
i i i didn't read in some uh
what happened
happened was
i was searching for something on youtube
suddenly i saw one of my videos
i say oh my god i'm in youtube
and i opened it to see
how
it sounded
suddenly i saw all the list of comments below
i said like oh my god
is
so anyway
really i i had no idea about the comments
and i was trying to uh to read some of them
really i've been like two hours trying to read all the comments in every video
um it's been like 30 seven videos
um let's begin with the sacrum chakra i wrote the post day very late
after i went to the pyramid i i i went to a field of mangos in the delta
this is
so today we find ourselves ourselves in the sacrum chakra see
um we are in the sacrum chakra inside the wick of the mind
to be honest i i don't remember exactly
i wrote
today um it is about the frustrations
achievements yeah okay
let's try to understand
frustrations
achievements means according to the sacrament chakra remember
in order to to understand the energy of
chakra we are working with always we have to picture the idea the idea of from
does it comes
energy
if we are in the sacrum
we will have the relation with
with the plexus
of course
the heart chakra
we understand the center of creation
is the sacrum we need to understand the relation
it has with the plexus
the heart let's remember the heart
the heart did or does to bring to receive the energy to give the energy
it goes through the heart okay
this is the circuit of energy positive
negative constantly
remember
does the heart chakra receive
give energy
it doesn't matter from
if you uh if you write with your um if you're right-handed or left-handed it doesn't matter is the receiving hand is always the left one
is the closer one to the heart through the heart through the heart the energy is processed is absorbed by the body
it became like nutrients for the self for the being
i am
we can say
energetically uh maybe the heart is like the esophagus
brings all the energetical food to the stomach
energy
comes from the receiving in the left the left hand
then goes to the heart it goes to my plexus
is the source of energy of my own self
the energy goes from the heart to the plexus the plexus
it does is to absorb it
makes
energy a part of myself it is created as myself
when it is already created okay it's strong
now i am able to give it back again to the others
how can we understand
that
i receive energy i channel from my heart to my plexus i made
energy part of myself i create
energy as part of my potential
from my potential i take i take action
through my action i give back
energy to others
this is like a perfect circuit i receive the energy i made it mine i activate my potential
then i by action give it back to others
what happened
in order to give back
energy the thing
we have to do is to recognize
we need to create
energy
we need to make a product of
energy
we could take action with will to understand
better is
all
energy
i received goes through my heart activates the potential in myself in the plexus
then
it goes to below it's it creates something a product something new it transforms the energy
i receive into something different
something transcendental something new
i could use it okay to give it for others as an action hmm we could work with many examples with
because uh
life works like
that's the basement of life the um i will make an example
is very silly
easy okay
um we have to picture
with emotions works exactly the same
when we are talking about the system even if we are speaking about the physical the emotional or the mental aspect they work exactly the same to picture the example is like you have you have for example you organize a dinner
at your house
you didn't have uh anything to make the food
you ask for your friends
are coming to bring the things to make the food
for example you ask for one of them to give you the tomatoes the other one let's use
the other one mushrooms for example
they bring you each one of them they bring you something different
when they bring it to you you get all
things
then you wash it you cut it you put it all together you put oil you put salt you prepare the salad
then
they're all sitting at the table you go with a salad with all the things
you didn't have
they brought to you
you made the process
you give it to others by action
would be the example
it would work for everything for mental for emotional anything just remember the salad
there's a say
some people used to say life is like a salad
it's like a mess all mixed
picture
life is really like a salad
everyone have brought you something different okay
you
have all mixed
you don't know who brought you
so um that's kind of
life works to understand
we are doing in the virgo um in the virgo month is like it's like we take our own salad
we are taking the tomato out
saying who gave me
tomato uh
the other one you know
who take who gave me
carrot
this is kind of
we are doing
where is
salad being prepared specifically in the sacrum at the sacrum
is specifically the spot the point
you prepare everything you create everything you put all the parts together to create something new
by creating something new you are able to share it having
image we have to recognize
this is the center of creation
is the place
i receive the energy i recognize the potentials of the energy i create something
then i can deliver it let's keep with the salad example to understand
so first of all we have to recognize
that if i am aware if i am conscious i will first recognize
each um vegetable
i will receive from others i will recognize
vegetable was given by whom
by
i will recognize
that person has a attachment or no attachment has a the same vibration or a resonance with
vegetable
if he or she is giving
fruit to me is
they resound with
with
vegetable
imagine
if you are conscious you will recognize
that person is giving me a tomato
is a fruit
the tomato it means like it it has the shape of the heart it has the color
so it's like
person is giving me a part of his love or her hers or his love imagine
some of them is giving me ledges
that means
for example is something um weak
the legend is like
weak
that
other person is giving me uh a part of its weakness
uh um
i receive it
i know from
it comes
that's the resonance of
person
i received these two things weakness
love picture
that those two vegetables are very fresh they just gave it to me
when i receive these two i will prepare a salad mixing the tomato
the lettuce the weakness
the love
putting both together
i create tenderness tender to be tender something uh soft i don't know the word tender it says okay
i create weakness
love both together lettuce
tomato both together tender
i give tenderness it's a it's a name i don't know exactly the name uh sweetness okay sweetness perfect
i give sweetness to becoming tender for those people for both of them okay basically i am giving something i created something
being aware okay being aware of um of
i created something
was useful for both of them
i'm giving them
tender
sweetness
one of them were willing to receive love
the other one was
soft
he needed uh tenderness for to to feel better
the other one uh love
it's mostly the same
i was able to do
because by being aware by being conscious i knew
the the others needed
i create something new for myself to give to them imbalance see imagine
situation if you are unconscious
you will do is you receive the tomato from
person remember the tomato is love
you remember you you you received the tomato from
person
you see
this tomato is
beautiful it's
perfect
you don't want to cut it
you would lose
beautiful love
what do you do you put it in the fridge
you say i will leave it for later
i would like i would love to see
tomato once again
it's
so beautiful
i put it on uh the fridge
imagine
the other one gives me the lettuce
i don't like much the delicious
i just cut the ledges
say i will prepare it quickly
so they eat it
they live away
happened
that the one
brought me love in the tomato shape the one
loved
brought me weakness in the loot let's shape
myself all of us have eaten a salad made of only weakness only weakness in the meantime the tomato is dying in the fridge
what happened
i someday open the fridge i will see
the tomato is already dead rot okay rotten rot i don't know okay it's useless for anything just realized about
that
what we have
we used to call attachment is to put
love or
tomato in the fridge
by trying to not to lose it it got rotten it's useless
that's attachment
this means
when i am not using
energy
energy gets stuck attached to my body in
process of creation
we can have is two different things if i reckon if i recognize
by giving the tomato
the lettuce the salad putting them all together
recognizing about
good is to receive
to give without expecting anything
that is
we call achievement to use the energy
now i achieved something into the outside
in the other hand
i go open the fridge one week or one month later
i saw
tomato rotten
that's
we call frustration we usually think
achievements
frustrations are things
i left in the past
are things from the past we have to realize
that we usually believing
that frustration
achievement are in the past we used to believe
they stay
in the past
there is no past for the body if i feel frustration if i feel achievement is not
the body thinks
they were
if they feel it if the body feels it it's
it's happening
here
now both of them are things
are constantly
they hadn't passed they are
why uh they are
why these two things are happening
because
what i did my friends they liked
much the salad
i did
they came back once again
the other week they came back again
the tomato are it's still in the fridge the same tomato the achievement is something
because it was an achievement it keeps staying
it's constantly renewal energy for me
it's like
is my friends are coming back to my home
i made it made them a good meal the other thing the tomato is still in the fridge
how do i do to make something
is rotten to be useful again the way in
i will use
rotten emotion is by using it as a compost
i take the tomato
i put it on the ground i create the compost with the tomato
the same seed of the tomato using the rotten part of it will create a plant
not only i will receive a new tomato
i will have many of them
i have a plant the way in
i can use
compost is best by just taking
frustration
energy of frustration i take it again i recognize it
i look around me
i try to picture in
relationships
i have
as friends whatever i just try to picture
situations are similar to the things
happened to me
i with
energy take action to try to nourish or stop
i did in the other time like for example um something
i didn't said something
i didn't know
to handle i tried to handle it differently
i use
energy as an awareness
also i can write a letter to the people of
happen
write a message with
awareness
of living away letting it go
in
way i'm beginning to understand
to use
energy
the body doesn't know
it's history the body feels history
and
so
is
we do
kind of things is
we can heal
work with our body
in
moment
just remember
life is a salad leave the the vegetables to get rotten
those who got rotten just made some compost
we can know
can we create the compost first we have to acknowledge to recognize
vegetables got rotten
which ones were able to you were able to give to your friends in the table i hope
example was useful for you
if you didn't get it
see the video again the vibration of today is
the code of today is the note see
it says johannes saint john the poem ends with the signature of saint john in latin from
years later its initials would be taken as the last note of the scale of c major the note c whose alphabetic name is the letter b it is related with the superior center chakra
means the highest one
connects us with the cosmic reality the one
brings us closer to the unity of all the dimensions of the being the higher self
remember
after the alignment if you didn't wrote it the task of today would be to write a list of your achievements
in another column your frustrations
let's begin as always by carries in the body by massaging the body
put yourself in a comfortable position well you stretch yawn i let the weight of my body fell down as i start to focus in my breathing with imagination i bring to my breathing the oxygen through my nose to my lungs heart blood organs
muscles as i breathe i allow myself to feel the heat within my body
how
heat goes through my skin feeling out my magnetical feel on my aura i imagine the light of the i am over my head with my imagination i feel
all the energy
heat around me starts to spin going up feeling filling up all
light of the i am making it brighter
brighter
i allow myself to feel the i am coming down through my body going through my crown of beliefs my qualities in the brain my truth in the throat my service in my heart going down through the plexus to all my potentials
i observe the light of the i am irradiating in the second chakra i recognize in the sacrum the center of my creation the place
everything
i can do is generated
i recognize
in
center of creation i have two energies one of my achievements the other one of my frustrations
both energies are useful for myself to create
and
i allow myself to irradiate the light of the i am through all my achievements
through all my frustrations recognizing
both of them are useful for my creativity
i activate these two energies as equal imbalance through my vibration um as i keep pronouncing the sound i recognize
the i am is the one able to bring consciousness to my process of creation
i am
being
brings the message of balance harmony
creation through consciousness take a deep breath i am the emissary of creation i am the emissary of creation i am the emissary of creation i take my hands to my heart
i recognize
that as my achievements as my frustrations both of them creates the energy of who i am right
both of them are the energies
i have right
to create
and
and from the i am with my consciousness i recognize
i am able to use both of them in order to create new realities in harmony take a deep breath i am the emissary of creation i am the emissary of creation i am the emissary of creation take a deep breath
i start to stretch the body bringing all
consciousness from the heart caressing massaging stretching thanking the body for being the anchor of
consciousness
and
yawn
i come back
and
softly opening your eyes
in
way we anchor the energy of the i am in the sacrum
maybe you would feel some um dc or nauseous or something just try to listen your body
maybe you just let it go flow walk around lay on the floor
above all drink a lot of water
rests thank you for being
and as always see you tomorrow at the same time for the root chakra see you tomorrow rest
