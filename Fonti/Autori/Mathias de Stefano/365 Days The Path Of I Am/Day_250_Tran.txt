foreign I don't know if you can hear me or not 
um just to tell you that I had so much 
uh low energy I I was feeling so bad yesterday 
that in the moment I finished the transmission and I closed the window of 
them that I was working with here for YouTube um 
the the video disappeared and and the whole screen disappear and everything went 
down and the computer couldn't run it didn't work 
um until today so uh today after I went to the pyramid 
and I started to be um much more 
um relaxed um so 
um today I align myself in the pyramid I felt better and I went back to the to 
the room and the computer worked so it was connected to me but it did an update 
it and we need to updated uh I don't know something happened with the plugin of the camera 
um and it's not working so I guess it's gonna be like this today 
so I'm trying to speak with someone um I'm speaking right now with someone 
for the phone to try to solve it but I don't know so 
so only with my with my state of vibration yesterday I 
almost broke the computer so imagine 
um so now you know that it's better not to 
be close to me when I when I am in a low vibration 
and to open it in the phone 
um but I don't have I only have 50 of 
battery uh sorry that also because I am really 
really bad with technology uh nobody gave me the 
the passwords for the things unless it's really necessary 
um so I'm waiting for someone to give me 
possible how am I doing this is a mess 
so anyway uh Asylum um 
I don't think that there is much more to speak about because I guess that 
today has been very to the point 
in the blog I think that everything is already set 
so I don't have all the things here to solve the problem also because 
there's a wedding of course and I'm not in my place 
um so the thing that I wanted to talk about today was regarding the 
the two visions of the ego that I speak at the beginning of the post today in 
the blog so just to to let you know uh for all 
the new people that is following the path um that 
that all the information of what we are talking about and what am I 
um am I because why am I referring to 
um to the post I'm referring to in every one of these uh videos 
um is www.yosoi.red you saw it meaning I am in 
Spanish and red meaning Network in Spanish 
so you have all the information there for those who don't know what am I 
talking about so something that I wrote today in the post 
um that I would love for you to understand better 
um which is uh regarding the ego 
so we have two fundamentals uh two fundamental things 
um in in the universe in the mental Universe 
which is the ego and the essence so we have spoken about what Essence is 
but um I would like for you to for us to see 
that again for a moment so remember with me the etymology of 
essence essence comes from three words 
one that is s that means to be in in European 
languages the other one is and that means the one the subject the one 
that makes the action and the third one is yeah that in 
English becomes an e uh a letter e 
um meaning the quality of something the quality of something 
so Essentia essence means the quality of a subject to be 
the quality of a subject being something okay that's what Essence 
means essence uh uh Essentia 
um has the concept of um 
Essence has the concept in the universe of the one that simply is 
that's why that's why the last sentence to summarize the entire universe is 
[Music] this is it this is it 
so um or is like this 
so the idea of of this is that the Universe basically 
is what it is it's nothing else what it really is 
so the universe is basically a subject expressing the quality of 
being the only thing that really exists in the universe is this being 
expressing itself being itself so that would be uh the essence 
the quality that reminds us that everything is what it is 
so Essence is the center of all the things of every being 
because all are related to the topic of to be 
so in the other hand of essence we have existence 
so we have two things in the universe the essence and the existence 
so if Essence is the quality of a subject 
just being just being 
existence existence is the quality of the being 
that is out of itself 
is out of the essence so 
existence come from the word X that means 
to go out from there comes the word ex exit 
and it comes from the word study that means to be in a place to stay 
so X study means that you live the place where you are to 
go into another one existence 
so this means that the essence is the being that it is 
that is in one place and the existence is the being that gets 
out from that place so how does this being exist 
meaning going out well 
it is by expansion expansion is to expand 
so X meaning out and pan mean everything so expansion is 
the action to go out to the everything to the whole 
so remember as we have said that the essence is just to be it's just to be there is 
that one particle that starts to move through different times 
and spaces that projects itself projects means to 
be thrown a way to project 
in this projection is what we spoke about the particles 
being only one projected in many okay like multiplied by thousands by many in 
different times and different spaces that's how 
um the essence starts to exist starts to expand around 
in many other particles so what are these particles around 
doing in the periphery which is around the sphere around the center 
what they are doing there is to create networks to connect around synapses of 
many new ideas of itself so the essence the being can transform its idea of 
itself so each one of these dots of these particles coming from the essence will 
be how to refer to themselves referred to themselves in order to look for tools 
for the essence to learn and to expand 
and because these particles are referring to itself 
we call them egos so remember 
the essence is only one spot the essence just is 
there's nothing else that the essence can do so in order to know itself to understand 
itself it needs to expand to exist 
to move away this Essence in order to observe itself 
it will go out expand and from this expansion is it starts to 
exist and by existing moving out 
these other particles of itself these other projections in different times in space 
will understand will give to the essence 
different points of view different projections ideas 
of itself and those particles are called egos 
so as you can see now every ego in the universe 
every individual that refers to itself that can see around the universe the reality 
is just a projection of the essence of the Divine Essence 
it's just a projection of the Divine Essence through time and space 
the egos then are just extensions of the Divine Essence trying to understand 
itself to experience itself so the egos are basically 
the tools of the essence to understand itself 
the tools that move forward creating networks around synapses 
changing and exchanging points of views so they can create tools 
to understand better and can become 
okay 
so now from the point of view of existence we look into the ego from a very different way 
because we see that the ego is like this being full with Things fill 
up with many different things this is why we see the ego as something 
that doesn't allow us to see the essence to connect with the essence because it's so 
full with many tools and stuff that doesn't allow us to see the 
pureness what usually happened 
um when we make the questions ourselves who 
am I what is the essence how can I reach the essence of myself 
the first thing that people teach us is how to get rid of the ego because the ego is the one that doesn't allow us to 
see that essence and it's in thus in that moment when we 
start to confuse ourselves and to judge the ego 
so this point of view is not the reality 
because when we see it from the point of view of the essence the ego is the one 
that has been uh harvesting all this data from the 
biological point of view the emotional point of view the the beliefs 
that help the essence to have a new point of view 
so as you see the problem here is not the ego the problem here is that we 
are not taking responsibility on the tools that the ego has in order to see 
the essence so it is when 
we are not responsible of our biological history of our traumas 
emotional world when we are not responsible of our beliefs 
and our values that's the moment when the ego becomes 
an impediment something that denies us to connect with the essence 
so we can understand now that the essence 
is that being that has the quality of just to be 
and the ego is the one that through the existence 
allows that being to have a different point of view 
to be able to open ourselves to have different points of views 
allows us to expand and that's the key of evolution 
when we start to connect with the essence we start to 
realize that everything that exists is referred 
to myself that everything around is just a reflection of me 
when we start to connect to the essence we suddenly start to feel 
that we are very important that we 
had other lives and we start to remember other lives and that we have a mission and that 
we are part of something that unites us all 
and when we start to connect with the essence suddenly we start to say I am very important when I have come to 
do to this world is really important it's my mission 
and also we start to perceive ourselves as very important that we have come to 
this world to do something very important that from the beginning of the 
universe from The Source the main source of the universe of the cosmos we have been sent by someone bigger 
greater than has sent us to do something important to 
this world and when we start to do is to decorate 
those things that we feel from the essence with the tools of the ego 
and we start to leave that mission from the essence 
Through The Eyes of the ego and when you start to get much more 
aware of the things suddenly a question comes up which is 
really me I'm mine the chosen one to do this 
the ego starts to do the question 
when we start to connect with the essence suddenly we 
realize that there is no one else around that it's just a projection and 
suddenly the ego asks itself am I the only one 
that exists and the only possible answer to this 
is yes it is 
it is like this 
so the thing is that the essence 
is the only thing that exists so everything that 
we see everything that we experience what we are is simply 
a way of that essence so the only possible answer is it is 
we are all important we are all that essence 
and here we have two types of egos in the existence the ego that believes is important 
because of his history 
and the ego that knows 
that is important because he choose that history 
the ego that believes is important 
that believes that is important shouts out loud that is important 
the ego that knows that is important 
keeps the calm and don't shut up and don't 
speak out loud is calm 
and I guess that it has been really important that today 
we don't have an image of my face and speaking about 
this Essence and existence 
and this two faces of the ego we don't have my face 
we have only one dot 
that is expanding everything is perfect 
the vibration for today is 
the statement for today is I am the Eternal Vision 
the code for today is Kenny's manual Orion the giant had two hunting dogs 
that helped him in his hunting trips the younger and the older 
the major dog the other one is the most known one for its heart is the brightest 
star serious it is the guide dog the faithful friend 
that showed the direction that shows us the way and protects us 
from what we can't see like the ego
