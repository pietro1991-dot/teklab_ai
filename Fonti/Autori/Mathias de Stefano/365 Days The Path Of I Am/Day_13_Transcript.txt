hi everyone good morning good evening good night welcome to
uh another day
to make
balancing to our heart through the process of emotion
i just hope
after working with
i can unblock
that i have
so um remember
what we are meant to work with today is uh opening our hearts
to be coherent with
we feel within in our hearts the most important thing
i wanted to share with you um from
i was
i wrote in the blog today in
conversation with my higher self is
uh in order to to be aligned with with information
we are going to work with today is
we have to recognize
you cannot blame or thanks to other people about
we feel
every emotion
we feel is just in ourselves is within ourselves
nothing
we really feel is related to others is related to
we feel within
this is
what we have to do is to balance the heart
is the connection of
love
that emotion
we feel uh with others
we could balance
instrument of ourselves
the main important thing
i guess it's a good way to understand
do we feel
how do we feel is we have to picture ourselves like if we are a guitar an instrument musical instrument
imagine
the whole of the guitar is in your heart
all the emotions are the vibrations
represents the chords
cross
body through the main part
then the chakras are these keys
um fix the the chords in order to sound properly
everything
we feel everything
we
resounds with us is according to
we are um vibrating ourselves with them okay
what we have to do to feel the proper emotion from the outside world we have to try to adjust the chakras to um i don't know
to say in english athena
do you say in english athena someone knows um to balance a line i don't know the word in english um
wait i'm asking tune okay tune okay perfect thank you to tune the chords okay
they can sound um correctly
this is our job
is our work we cannot blame others blame or thank others for
we feel
we have to do is to recognize
everything we feel from others is according to
we have tuned our emotions in
instrument
is
guitar okay the place
we are going to feel
is
in
hole
which is the whole of the guitar
this is a place
everything will sound
that's
we have to balance
so someone asked me today
place um
is the correct sense for the chakras to spin in order to balance the chakras as we tune up the the the chords okay
what we have to do is to to see your right hand your right hand like
okay the finger
finger is pointing up okay
when
finger is pointing up
all the other fingers go into
uh direction yes all the other fingers goes to
direction
okay they move like
so it means
the energy is being up
your fingers go to the left okay
the energy moving to the left pushes the energy up
the energy going down is moving right okay
in order to download the energy the chakras must be spinning to the right
bringing the energy uh with
hand
this hand is the one
gives the energy
moves the energy it doesn't matter if you are um left-handed or right-handed okay
one is the one
moves the energy
it's the positive one okay
it doesn't matter if you are left-handed or not is
one
there's no correct place
it must spin it doesn't matter
matters is is
they spin
that they are aligned all in balance
they all spin into the same place to the same direction
this just for another job um
we are not specifically working with
right
we are going to do it in another moment
let's read the information for today today we are in the heart chakra within the second week
is the emotional one in the month the first month
is related to leo
the icon the aspect of the icon the vibration of the day we are going to work with today is he is not high like you in english would read is he
uh the reason
is he is
in the ancient languages of
region uh the sound ha means the life the history uh everything um yeah uh life
history
uh the sound e represents the balance represents like a yeah like a balance
is in the middle of the heart
both hands balancing two aspects of ourselves
this is
the statement for today is i am life imbalance the reason
the heart is the balance is
uh is in the center between the mind
the body the the the the doing okay the action
also in between the receiving
giving
it's like in a cross
the sign of the cross beyond the christianism represents precisely
the balance between
i feel
i think
i do uh
i receive
what i give okay the code of today is the vibration ah it's not a it means letter a means eternity is pierced by the second sound of the origin the force of the spirit the energy
sees everything
knows everything
generates everything the ah represents the skies from the eye consciousness who observes
guides the creation basically
sound was related with the falcon with the hulk the eagle the the bird
that is watching everything
they related
with the spirit for sure many of us come from a tradition
is christian for sure
is a lot of weight
karma
judgment over
cross um over
symbol uh
is
thing
i would like to make a new um meaning to re-signify it's okay well said like
to make to give a new meaning to
symbol
was the the first meaning
was the the core of the cross it was not about the crucifixion it was about
meaning
it's good for all of us
maybe had a judgment over
symbol across the history to signify to to give a new meaning to
so not the new meaning the correct meaning
it had in the past okay
was remember to be balanced with
you think
you do
you receive
what you give
is
you are doing basically okay let's relax take a moment to sit comfortable
we can start
i will put the music
you stretch you start to yawn to carries your body leave all the attention away let's crease all the body we close our eyes remember
this carries us
touching the body is to give thanks
honor the physical aspect of myself for taking care
being an anchor for the spirit to be
and
i start to relax my body letting the weight of my shoulders my arms
hands fall down discharging all the tension through breathing take a deep breath hold
breathe out leaving all the tension away i focus just in my breathing i go with the oxygen to my lungs my heart through the blood towards the organs muscles
