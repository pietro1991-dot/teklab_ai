hi everyone good morning good evening good night
i hope
find you well with everything we are doing day by day
um i just want to to let you know
um there's no necessary to make
constantly day by day maybe maybe for some of you it's hard to to do all of
day by day
don't worry you have time you can do it any day you want to picture
this works the reason
we are doing
day by day is just to imagine
we are all like a chorus a choir of people all singing
suddenly if you get in the middle
you want to start to sing you just go inside the car
you start to sing
match with the others
suddenly you start to be in the same rhythm
don't worry don't worry
remember
for those who are following constantly every day today is the day of the pineal gland
is related to the third eye i wrote today in the blog about uh the the pineal gland
the eyes
i get i guess
today was a bit clearer than the other day uh the information more straight
i want to share some information in new ways
we can all be in the same page
remember
yesterday we work with the hypothesis gland
is in the center of the brain at the high of the ears
today we are going to work with the pineal gland
is a bit in front
upper
is in the middle of the eyes
the center like around
the shape of
gland um is
the name uh sorry the name of
gland is related with the shape of it
is like the seed of a pine the tree well
this is
we really
seed also with the divine
the pine was like a like the tree
connected with the heaven
of its shape
connection uh meant
that tree was the tree of life or the tree to the divine
the seed of it would be the aspect
allows us to be connected with the divine things to have in mind about the the pineal gland
gland is biologically related to waking up
going to sleep biologically is the gland
generates the hormones
helps us to go to sleep
gives us
willing of going to sleep
when we are exhausted
we want to lay in bed to rest
also is the gland
helps us to to be awake
it gives us the will to make stuff to wake up in the morning to do our our things is the gland related to those two things
this is
spirituality take
gland as the one
awakens the consciousness
it's the awakening of consciousness okay
usually we think
this gland is the one
awakes only awakes
it's not it's also the one
brings you to the unconscious is the one also
brings you to to sleep um yeah to sleep as a an aware being
basically
this land will do is to regulate our awakening process
in order to understand
this works i would like to meet you fight uh to take the myth away i don't know
to say it properly in english uh to take them in the way of some of the spiritual things
we believe from
gland
one of our beliefs about
gland spiritual in spirituality is to think
this land is the one
we have to awaken to uh to be connected with the spirit to um to be able to see other dimensions
to well to be connected with the divine
one of the myths is
we need to have it constantly awaken
we can be spiritual
this is one of the keys of the spirituality today to activate the pineal gland let's have in mind
for sure all
is true
um
we do with
gland is to perceive the reality in a different way
means
we have these two eyes to observe the outside
it brings the information from the outside to the inner eye the third eye inside
then
the third eye changes his idea
projects
it opens inside a new idea of
it's outside it's the gland
is related with the concept
helps us to perceive the world in a different way
is the one related with the ideas is the one
perceives the ideas
interpret the reality in different ideas one of the myths
i would uh light on to for you to understand is
when we say activate the pineal gland
we are talking about is to expand our perception of reality to open ourselves to a new conception to watch a different dimension of reality
we need to understand
a dimension is a dimension is a perception of our reality for example
here is just a dimension it's the dimension
we can only see
when we change the perception from our inner perspective of reality we open a little bit more
a little bit more
we can see a different dimension of our reality
we could be more wide open
sometimes
we think about activating the pineal gland we think
suddenly we will see angels or surfings flying in the sky
it's not like
what you are doing with the activation of the pineal gland is to understand better the reality you live in sometimes it is just about to understand better the position of another person
lives with you maybe you are arguing
suddenly you have an activation of the air gland
sadly you say oh
i understand
that person is mad not fairies
angels
horizontal our reality
we start to open the other one
is vertical
we start to see these other beings like or whatever from other dimensions
this is
we must understand the pineal gland is something
awakens a little bit more in the perception of our own reality one of the things
we need to understand is
that
uh the most important thing to to say about the activation of
gland is
it's not just a moment a specific moment or a therapy
activates the pineal gland of course it helps
it helps you to improve
it's not just the therapy or the moment is about having a whole process
for example for the pineal gland it's about to
we eat
minerals we have inside we inherit um
um
and
sleep a lot
we need to sleep a lot in order to activate the paneer gland
it works better
we need to to rest
not just to sleep
is different rest very calm
relaxed one of the ways we have to understand
the pioneer gland is being activated is
we used to say
for sure you have said
in your life i don't see
as i used to do
i'm looking at
situation in a different way as i used to
you do
statement it's
your pineal gland is working it's doing a change okay one of the of the things
maybe you know for sure is
you can see
because the kids had better imagination they rest much more they can imagine a lot
they are very open to change they perceive very well the new situations
they adapt
and
they learn faster okay
this is
they usually say
in order to be more close to the spirit you must a kid to act to live like a child another one of the myths of
of
gland is
we need to activate it to hold it activated constantly okay um to be connected with the spirit
this is related with
um if we understood
the pineal gland in order to be better to be activated
be able to awaken better every day it needs to rest properly
in the spiritual way it also in order to be more aware
conscious it needs to also enjoy to be unconscious it it is kind of absurd
uh for sure
to work for the consciousness
suddenly i am saying
in order to be more aware
conscious we also need to be unconscious
how do you take
how do you eat it in order to understand
this works we need to understand
to be aware
conscious about everything
exists we need to learn
to enjoy
exists for the spirit to become unconscious is like go to sleep
it's like rest like enjoying like a kid
play with a reality
it was
we usually as humans used to say to divide everything into different concepts like if they were one against the other
they are constantly like against for us like if i am conscious i cannot be unconscious or if i am awake i cannot be sleeping
these two concepts are correlative to each other they need each other
i wouldn't be awakened if i wouldn't have sleep
because i am asleep
i am i am awake
i will need to rest
i cannot be awakened constantly
the same way if i am conscious i also need conscience to
we have to understand about
is
we are not doing
to get awaken
suddenly just being awake awaken constantly all the time we are doing
so the next time
we go to sleep we can rest we can rest relaxed
the reason
we don't go to go to sleep again
we want to be awakened constantly in our consciousness we have been dreaming nightmares okay we are living nightmares constantly we are not resting we are like nervous constantly
we sleep
this is one of the keys
we have to understand
we are not doing
to be constantly awakened
we are doing
so the next time we can rest
we sleep
we can enjoy to be unconscious
this is constantly a cycle
someday we will have to go back to sleep maybe in 2000 years
we will
we cannot live our lives like if we are not going to go to sleep again okay you need to leave your day knowing
you will have to go
sleep
rest
these are some of the concepts
myths
i wanted to clarify
we could all be on the same page
we work with the painting you know gland um i hope you could understand
i
i said today we are going to work with the uh vibration saw it's not it's not psy or say or is saul the statement of today is related to
sound
means i am the uh the consciousness path or i am the path of consciousness the code of today is related with the sound the vibration o
it says in the great explosion of the cosmos the subtle energies become atoms
these molecules
these minerals
by expanding will create galaxies stars suns planets cells organisms seeds plants creatures animals living being living beings in all its potentialities
