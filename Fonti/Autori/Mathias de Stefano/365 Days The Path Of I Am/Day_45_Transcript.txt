good morning good evening good night
today we are going to work with the um plexus chakra in the emotional level i remind you
we are in the month of virgo
um we are in the process of analyze
for those who had read today the blog i'm still possessing
if you read the blog all the expressions
i
i
i said
writing were the actual surprises
i got
while writing
that's
i wrote down like
wait i don't get it
um
it was actual reactions
i was just writing
the ion was saying
not thinking about
i was writing
this is
after
i wrote uh everything myself um i felt really bad uh i i know it was a lot of information
i will try to make a kind of summary of it
the first question
i did was about
if we were talking about emotions
feelings
do i relate my feelings with others with other people
one of the things the main things
he said was
um feelings are not just something
is being possessed by humans
is a natural um tool of evolution
the
he was explaining was like the feelings are just a process of evolution
when a species starts to seek for tools to feel secure
when
when a group of animals are trying to survive in in group
they are afraid of
is going to happen in the outside
what they
they uh created some of these animals is the feeling the bounds in between all of them to create um the sensation of security to be like all um to be like all um protected one another
feelings
emotions are one of the tools
the mammals had uh developed in order to trust each other
to feel secure
basically
the feelings had created was a link in between each one of the individuals creating like a network of people
of beings
this network is kind of a reaction
when something happens to one of them the others can react by feeling by comprehension to the other to help
person
this um these um these links in between the people we're creating
we call in mammals uh the herbs herbs hurts
this hurts
they create the culture they start to be called like families
this is one of the things
the i am was explaining
basically the reason
a herd is created a group is created with all these links is
they want to survive
basically they want to eat
as many you have in the group you can survive the better
you have many people protecting you have many people working hunting collecting
by creating all these links in between the individuals they create a very good structure of survival
all of it basically started by a need of eating
this is
the family in the past in the ancient times was the concept of the group
everyone can eat
we are going to the roots of the words of the languages
we are speaking we are not speaking chinese or hindi
um we are going to the origin of the anglo-saxon words
the latin words
is
we use the in our languages the concept of family to describe these groups family comes from the latin word famous
means hunger
the concept of family is the concept of a group of people
get together
they are hungry
this is
in roman times family was the name with
the people describe the group of slaves all these slaves the the the family
they call slaves were all under the control of of a lord
was like the master um
that's
we used to call pater familias
means the lord of the slaves
basically the family is a group of people
is together
they were hungry
they are together to survive
they created these links these emotional links
they could transcend through time
space by surviving sharing each other
this is
we usually create
idea
we have to defend the family
we are the family
also we have
feeling
we feel trapped in our families
this is not only something it's not only something
comes from blood it's about who i choose as family
family is not about only blood it's about
is the group
we feel links with
this is
as bigger are the links
we have the bigger the family
one of the explanations
the iam wanted to say is
usually in order to survive the hurt must have many many individuals
this is
naturally we are looking to be part of groups
something inside of us says if i am not being part of
maybe i will die
this thing is of creating bigger
bigger groups is just a feeling of creating security
the example
he used was you catch more fish with a bigger net
what he was trying to say is
in order to create many a bigger group with a lot of individuals you have to create the net
is the links in between all these people
a net is not something
is above us
that cover us
is something
we create with our own links by weaving each one of the links
now we go to the plexus
basically
he said is
the links
we create with other people is due to our lack of stuff or
we feel insecure whatever
the belief is
if i don't have all these links i will die
this is the thing
made us to repeat the same mistakes of our families once
again
this is
we feel
we are like slaves of a group
we repeat the same patterns once
again
basically these are like the mandates
we receive from our family from a lot of people in the past
comes over us
what he said was
if you go back to the past to try to heal each one of those links
you have with everyone
you are losing a lot of time
a lot of energy
what he said was if you discover
you are yourself the result of all of them
all of them lives in you
you can discover by yourself your own way to activate your nutrients
you don't need all
weight of all these other beings
basically
he said was focus on yourself
you are losing time trying to heal the whole network talking about family
the question was
so
was the moment
he started to explain about the miracle of jesus christ jesus christ of um the multiplication of the breads
fishes
the miracle was
he accomplished to make each one of the people nourish themselves
themselves by themselves without expecting anything from others the explanation is well detailed
in the text
basically
he explained is
the fish
we have within is the pancreas
the pancreas the organ
creates the hormone
helps us to find the nutrients to nourish the body
is the insulin seeking for the sugar around the body to process it in the cells
basically
he did was to try to teach everyone
to feed themselves with their own fish inside
i remind you
is well written in the blog
this was like the metaphysical aspect downloaded into the physical aspect
basically as the pancreas in our body looks for the sugar to nourish the cells
the plexus in the pancreas that's exactly the same towards the outside searching for
sugar in other people through the links of the people the sugar
we call love
basically
our own body in the pancreas is doing inside our or our organism
the plexus trying to connect with other people is basically the same
is to nourish the self the being
what he was trying to explain is
the links
we create in between all the beings around all the other people is creating a structure
holds a system of security
basically it's the same
the molecules does
they create a structure by unifying one to another creating molecules
structures we do exactly the same
through feelings
basically
he said is
to connect all the parts in latin you would say re ligare
is the origin of the word religion
basically religion means to create a structure of many links in between many people
the reason
all these people were together is
they were resounding
looking for the same truth or philosophy
the concept of a lot of people following a truth uh the same philosophy
they are all together in latin we say sequire
is to follow
that's the origin of the word secta
means those or
concept of following in latin
we could say
a carbon carbon structure
creates our body is a structure
we can call religion
basically uh the neurological system the neurons are catching information from the carbon structures
bringing
data following a structure to the brain
if they follow something an idea a feeling a pulse
we could say
the neurological system is like a sect all
happens in every aspect
basically
happened everywhere
for example a family we used to call it a clan
the
clan
we call a family is a group of people
follows the same philosophy
patterns constantly
we could say
that's a sect
basically a group of families or clans
are following certain cultural rules we also can say
is a religion
we could also say
the science has become a sect based in facts or we could say
a group of scientists around the world or republicans they are also a religion
they are following a structure
we create
how
everything is created like
due to these links are made of feelings
this is
we can consider
every group we are part of cultural religion uh philosophical scientific whatever family they are all considered religious groups
the question was we have to get rid of these links we have to just leave
away
he said no you shouldn't
you have to do is to understand
you need them basically the reason
we need the links is the same for
all the nature around needs links in order to exist from the very tiny aspects of reality like the atomic
molecular aspects
also the galaxies the bigger ones they're all linked each other
it's not about
to let those links away
to give them away it's about
place is mind in
place in
net
we have two ways as usual we we usually do two things two different ways
basically the first way we usually have is to accept the network i am part of like
is like
i cannot change it it's always been like
and it's it will always be like
and the other thing
we usually do is to deny the network
to say i am not
i am not part of
this is
i go away from
those are the two ways at least the most normals
we usually take
what the i am was trying to show me today is
i myself was denying
thing i was taking the second path like i don't want
so exactly
i was denying it i just repeated the same system
this is
we usually do
we do
we deny something in our lives
basically
we deny something
we give the back to it
we just try to go away from it
we are just doing is polarize it
by polarity i create a mirror
what i am watching
doing is exactly the same
backwards
an easy example in our lives is i hate my parents i don't want them i hate
they did with me
i was a child
i just go away from them
i just want to forget everything about them
sadly i get a partner
i have a child
i do exactly the same
my parents did
maybe it's a mirror
for example i have maybe in a mirror situation my parents were very christian
they made me study the bible
they said that's the only truth
if i did something wrong they would punish me
imagine
what i do
is exactly the opposite like for example i become scientist
i don't want religion
what i do to my child you will study a lot i don't want to hear anything about imagination or anything about about religion anything you will study
until you hadn't read all the encyclopedia you will not go out to play is the same
in a mirror
basically
i did was try to do exactly the opposite
i hated
trying trying harder to eliminate the concept of the religion
the group i end up creating a network
basically the big mistake
i did was to escape from
i have with them in order to heal
what i have to do is stop running from
and turn
watch it
say yes all the things
they were projecting on me yes it's like
but i will resign i will give another meaning sorry don't know
to pronounce the word i will give another meaning to
so basically
i am willing to do to heal
is not to become a master is to become a pedagogue
what i am trying to do is not to give you the truth is to give you tools to understand
you could find your own truth basically the reason
you are
is
you have left some other links
now you are trying to find a new place in a new network with new links emotional links
is the goal of allowing you to be part of a of a of a network it's not for you to um to be part of something
to to be part of
something just denying
you are part of a network
you have to accept
you are part of a network
what we have to build is a flexible network
everything can move
the key is to understand
the nature has given us the structure of the network
what we have to try to do is to create a flexible network
not something tight
the fundamental truth is the next let's take
as an example
the way we have to understand with
example is you are watching the water you see the water the question would be does exist the water does the water exist
the question is
the water doesn't exist it's just a perception of a group
water doesn't exist
water is a big
big chain of atoms of oxygen
hydrogen h2o
it's easy to see an oxygen
two hydrogens
what happens if i
oxygen with two hydrogens i take the hands of the hand of someone
is exactly like me in the side
the other one
the other one
we start to grab hands
we create the network
do we call
network we call
water
what is the water water is the network it's a network of an oxygen
has two hydrogens he only takes hands of another h2oh2o
everything
exists is the same
everything is chains
networks everything is a religion
what do we have to understand
the religion is the links of water
the truth is an oxygen with two hydrogens
everything every religion culture family group is created by myself in the heart
oxygen with two hands hydrogens
let's go
eliminate the pre-concepts
we have from a religion
a set the pre-concept
we have of religion
sex sex is
they control the mind of people
it's not
religion
sects the cults
do you say mind washed uh people or control people the mind of the people the truth is
people forgot their inner power that's the only difference the chains exist anyway
as a human i will always be part of a group it's inevitable we'll always be like
because i'm part of a family a part of a group whatever
what i can do is to transform myself i can do it as the water can become steam
myself i can reckon recognize the power
i have inside
chain
this is
it's
important to understand the concept of the i am
the concept of the we are
we are not going to be able to create a new world a transformation of our reality believing
the power is in the group it's impossible to do
and
is not denying the power of the group
recognizing the power of the group
i recognize the power
i have in myself it could take the power forever from myself
the i am told me today was don't deny
you don't want to be
it's inevitable for you to be the only way i can transcend the idea of religion sect the network is by recognizing
i am all
before
this is
it's
important for all of us to work ourselves within
not to think in
we are going to do as a group
this is
most of you of us are
today
we have been escaping from one religion
we ended up in another one
the only way we can go outside
eternal system is if everything
i learn i apply it to my own self not to do
to create it as a method
to use it as a tool to connect with my own higher self
this is
i will always share my path as an example
i will never tell you
to do yours
this is
when many of you are questioning me
can i do
i will always say look for it i will always say to you each one has its own time
everything
i am explaining right
is not just an explanation it's being part of the alignment
one of the things
i will tell to all of you
are following every day is
don't keep with everything
i say as if it is the 100 of the truth for in order to a network to be flexible we need to understand
each one has its own truth
this is
you have always to hear
learn from people
explain the same things in different ways
this is the only way in
we could flexibilize these links
we create by need the links of feelings
i will i would like to remind you
always in our lives we will believe
the place
we are in
very moment is the best
the good one
is just one aspect of the human nature believe
what i am looking from the world is right
this is
it creates a doctrine
a dogma
this doesn't mean
there are good things
bad things
as always i would like to remind you
there are no truth
lie
there are things
resound
things
not simple as
i remind you
in order to do
we are doing you have to be very flexible
now you are
but i hope
someday in the future you would be somewhere somewhere else
let's go to the alignment today i spoke more than usual
i thought it was necessary the vibration of today is
the stage name for today is i am the spark of the being
the the pattern for today is totally aligned with
we have uh have been speaking
and i had no idea spiritual pattern god the divine nourishment
life both originate from the same source water water is the physical product of maha's nine tears the great eye
sees everything whom with his contemplation nourishes with information
wisdom to every molecule of water of the cosmos the sound unifies unifies all to the eyes of the world with the great being the water mirror of creation mirror of heaven origin of existence take a deep breath stretch the body softly
so i relax my body as i focus in my breathing i pay attention
the oxygen goes to my lungs heart blood organs
muscles
i feel the heat within my body
how it goes through my skin towards every direction filling up a sea of vibration
energy i observed the light of the sun over my head above the sea breath in deep start to go up going outside slowly from the sea as an island emerging in the middle of the ocean as i go up i feel my body going outside about the water feeling the limits of the water going down from my crown eyes ears nose mouth chin neck shoulders chest back
it goes lower
lower arriving below letting the stomach the belly my arms until the elbows all outside the water
the rest below i feel the horizon
how the heat of the sun starts to dry my skin i feel the light of the i am penetrating through my skin facing to hidden to the plexus take a deep breath
feel from your plexus the links between all the emotions
feelings in
big ocean as roots of light expanding through the water i become aware
this links connect me with every person every object circumstance group
i know in my life
those
i don't know i recognize
from them i receive all the nutrients to be who i am through the light of the i am i become aware
i am not in need of those links
that i am an important part inside
network i recognize
i am not linked to them by need
i am linked with them by love
as i take a deep breath
begin to pronounce the sound i expand the vibration
consciousness the light of the i am towards all those things
are around me
fear fear as i keep pronouncing the sound i bring clarity
lighting the light of the i am in my plexus bringing consciousness to all my legs she uh i become aware
i don't need any of those things to be who i am
i am the spark of the being i am the spark of the being i am the spark of the being take a deep breath i take my hands to my heart i recognize
all the networks all the networks
i had created until
today has been by the need of a group to survive
i become aware
that from the spark of my being i set my intention
from
on all the networks
i aim to create will be held from the consciousness of the i am i am the spark of the self i am the spark of the being i am the spark of the being i am who i am take a deep breath
i start to bring
consciousness to all my body yawning crazing stretching
each one at its own time come back
now opening your eyes
the work for today the homework would be to write down
links of emotion
feelings are the biggest blings
i have in my life today thank you for being
and being part of
path at least
this part of it
see you tomorrow as always the same time rest
