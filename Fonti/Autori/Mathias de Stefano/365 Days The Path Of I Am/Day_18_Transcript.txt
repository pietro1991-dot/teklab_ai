hi everyone good evening good morning good night hope you
find you well I was just kidding I was just saying
each day I'm looking more like a guy of the 14th century with
hair
um get used to
because I am willing to live it longer
who knows let's let's laugh about it
today we are with the knees today I was uh I wrote in the blog about the ancestors
why they are connected to their knees uh is related to the miss the ancestors
uh these are the joints um are flexible in our path
works
go up
makes the strength to claim to to go up in the stairs um
are flexible in the path
walking
is the place of our body
all the information of our path is encoded
this is
all the history of ourselves is encoded in the um the knees is normal
when we have some conflict or something
result
solved in um in our history in our family uh we may have problems in our lacks in in the knees
we talk about ancestors it's not talking about people
have died or people
is
us in history we are talking about people
is still living within us one of the things
I was trying to explain was about
is a person
is an individual
a person is just the conjunction of emotions intentions
perceptions of who it is
when a person dies
someone dies the body just disappears tries to transform itself
the person spreads around in different dimensions as a soul
of course through our biology heritage
is
the um the the information of all our ancestors lives within us
basically another thing is
it's not
they are different people we are
people okay we are them
it doesn't matter if I was adopted or whatever the information is
because I exist the information towards the future is given to our sons
daughters the child's through biology
those who doesn't have a child they spread
information to all the people
they have shared with through the life obviously the biology part is even much stronger than the emotional one is stronger by biology
of course it's almost an obligation
you give
information to others
when you don't have ties
you don't have no one you just share the emotion you just um the emotion can be spread easily okay
it can be lost easily everything
we
in the past other people hadn't solved conflicts
solved we inherit
and we have to solve it
one of the of the things
we have as humans is
we see everything separated
one of the main ideas
we can possibly have is
we have to solve the problems of other people the other people problems
so the question would be
if I have a lot to solve with my own problems with my past life's problems um
do I have to solve the other people problems
the thing is
these other people is not me is sorry it's not different people it's also me it's myself living in different bodies through history
for
we have to understand two different things to understand these two we have to understand
anything in the universe is separated everything is United one
I have two different stories
we have two ways one is my Soul history
is energetical history the other one is the physical history of my body
imagine
these two path are Mom
Dad the soul the mom body the dad
also we have the two knees okay one uh left knee
uh right knee these two path are in the same in the same way okay I was just saying in a moment
a lot of people is saying um is uh
I'm speaking two languages put subtitles
I cannot do
because putting subtitles is very is very difficult
I am improvising okay constantly
it's very uh difficult um
um
of course I want you all to have to have the the vibration of
I'm saying uh
I was I would ask for you to to just have passion to be patient
to just listen with attention
I'm speaking in English um if
bothers you
I speak in Spanish thank you
these two path the soul
the body Mom
Dad energy biology
the two knees are our history the thing is in the path of biology the path of of my body it's not
I was born right
and
I am going to die
I die it just ends myself finished no my body is the product of a very long life in
the energy
the biology starts to transform itself constantly in different bodies
I don't have just
body Matthias is not just his body I am all the product of each one of the lives through
my biology went through
this means
each one of my ancestors is kind of a past life for me okay I hope you understand
the other thing is the emotional one or the soul okay the soul is the one
instead of just going into the biology path it goes from one group of biology to another okay it's moving from one dimension to another group of of races
animals
so on
is more related to myself
this is
I usually call my past lives
we have two different paths from
I lived past lives one for my ancestors
the other one through my soul the main one is the one of our souls
we usually call
one is the one
lived
many past lives
it's my soul
lived in different countries in different timelines whatever
then we have the body
the body was my grandmother grandfather
so on all my genealogical tree
also is my past life
this is
sometimes we may feel
we remember our past life from our soul
it's not our soul is the memory of an ancestor of someone from my DNA my DNA
I am working about past lives is not just about talking about myself is also talking about about my ancestors I cannot be separated from them from those memories
I am them I am them in a different body in a different shape in a different situation a different time
I am done the easiest way to understand
is the cycle of water the best way to understand
is through the process of water you may know the cycle of water of course the ocean evaporates gas goes to the clouds the gas goes to the mountains start to drop
every drop of water is a different being
also can be frozen
it become it becomes a snowflake
they are unique different like we are
then they melt they go back to a river from the river to the ocean again
they can be splited in many billions of shapes eyes um uh eyes clouds different gases different lakes lagoons Seas Rivers whatever
they all are water all water
we talk about soul
body we have to think
we are talking about gas
ice two different shapes of water that's it
everything
we are
is just the result of every one of the cycles of water we have to picture
all the eyes snowflakes glaciers are the bodies
different bodies
we have
then the gases the clouds in the sky they are the soul
very different
they are water
this is
it's
difficult to to speak universally about family
what we do is to create plans inside
only being
we all come from the same essence
this is
mostly we all share the same story
the concept of family is just something linear a concept a linear concept one of the main things we have to understand is
when we are trying to heal our ancestors we are not healing other people we are just arranging ourselves we are just looking for the balance in our own body see
now I will say something
is very difficult to accept
the thing is
this is endless
it never ends
why it never ends
we are eternal um
the goal is not to be to heal everything to be the best human ever in history no our goal is to try to find Harmony in the process of going through history
is
usually
we solve a problem comes another one a new one
I was I was talking about imagine 90 000 people according to these mathematics of going backwards in history in biology is not precisely like
but you can picture the idea
you need approximately 90 000 people in the past in just 500 years to create you
I could be born imagine yourself trying to solve the problems of 90 000 people in just one life it's impossible
what we have to reach for is Harmony between all of them imagine
that um I can only solve the problems of all these people
resounds with me I cannot ReSound with 90 000 people of the last 500 years
were connected to me I can only solve the problems
are aligned with me
are resounded with me my problems had a specific energy
matches with the problems of other people in my history
maybe my kids will have other problems
are matching with some other people
it's just a real soft one of the things
we need to understand about
is
our goal is not to heal our history
we could start from the very beginning with a new history with a new story
we are all
story We Are All That from the very beginning
what we are doing is not trying to get rid of the past
we are trying to do is to comprehend
past to put awareness to
to integrate
information
when we do
we can use
in our present as a gift as a as a tool okay there's no need to understand
right
I know there's there's too much information maybe um
you will have your time maybe you can listen to
many times
maybe in some other Moment by yourself no rush the important thing is
we become aware step by step there's no rush remember
here
we are trying to close a cycle of History to start a new one
we are picking the information from the past
we could build something new in the future we are not doing
to just clean everything
go into a better life that's a Hinduism concept the reality is
we are just one only body changing shapes okay
this is
when we start to work with our own body to align the history of our own body we can start with also balancing the history of uh our body through the history
the reason
we we think
oh my God
is too much it's
we are designed as a body we are designed to die
we are prepared to die
someone talks about eternity it seems like oh my God no I want to die I want
to finish
eternity is is amazing
you transform yourself constantly the only thing
is exhausting is the concept of being like a hamster rolling in the same will constantly the same the same the same the same
is exhausting if I change the perception of
will I transform
in a spiral
I will always be changing
watching a different perspective
we don't have to
get desperate we have time
all
just to make you the idea
those are the concepts
we need to clarify for our needs we are in the month of the Leo constellation related to the potential of icon in the day of the niece related to um to in in the week of emotion
the vibration we are going to use today is whole whole the h means life history
uh not you who means nice
uh also the path to go ahead
the statement for today is I am the life
creates the path or I am the path of life whatever is useful for you
the information of the day is related to the sound e uh the vibration e
it says in the heart of the cosmos the soul generates energy positive
negative
highly vibrates in
sound invading all the positive all the possible spaces with its pulse it's it's beating making the creation vibrate to its limits generating light energy emotion
we start to make a massage to the body to yawn to stretch the body closing my eyes foreign we curse our bodies we thank our body for being the anchor of the spirit in the Mata I relax focusing in my breathing Kitty breath I become aware of every breathing in
every breathing out foreign I feel the oxygen going to my lungs hard blood muscles
organs coming out through my skin foreign I feel all the heat of my body coming out filling up all my aura I recognize
