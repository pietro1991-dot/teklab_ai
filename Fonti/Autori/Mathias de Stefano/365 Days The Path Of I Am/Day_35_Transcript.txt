hi everyone good morning good evening good night i hope you can hear me
you can see me
perfect great solitary i have it on mine i did mine
i must say
maybe it's
i am doing all
every day
i go to the pyramids
do the meditations
then focus on all
suddenly i realized
i had solved
many things in such a short time
i was surprised about all the things
i solved in in a tiny in a short period of time
of course
i am doing
every day constantly
don't worry you can do it whatev at the moment you you feel ready to do it at your own time today is about the is about the plexus today we are related to the plexus
of course the plexus means the attachments
for sure in
consciousness world um something
we usually hear a lot is
can we detach ourselves from other things
this is
i guess it's important to realize
understand the
to be a touch means
what to be detached means
to get detached
the reason
we relate the attachments to the plexus is
from the plexus is from
we wave all these links around
all these links
we have to the outer world comes back to the core to the plexus creating the idea of the personality the links create
personality
we are
to relate
to understand
we need to go to understand the relation
the plexus has with the heart chakra
we saw yesterday let's remember
from the mind level the heart means the service to be on service
remember
in order to be in balance with your service you have to realize about the circuit of the energy from the giving
the receiving
are the two extensions of the heart my arms
my hands realizing
the heart is the middle of
giving
receiving
means
everything
will
i will receive will come to my heart let's try to pay attention with the mechanism of
it works
in order to understand
at the moment i receive something it goes through my heart
i have to give something in another point of view
i give something the universe must give me something back in order to feel to fulfill the uh filling up is better yeah to fill up my heart the the vacuum
i created all the time
i give i have to receive in the same amount of energy
let's be clear about
the energy
i
i received back it's in the same vibration as i give it
pay attention to
it's not it's vibration not intention it's a very different thing vibration
intention to picture the difference vibration is
i feel an intention is something
i would love it to be
for example i am sad today for example i am sad
i am willing to be happy tomorrow
that will
intention
i said is for the future
the vibration is
it is
pay attention to
example
maybe you feel related to
you say with
specific face
sound
sentence i don't know
i receive bad things
i give
give
always give in my life
what you are given is just pain it's just sadness heaviness even if i am trying to give something really beautiful to someone else the energy
i am putting to
beautiful thing
i gave was
low
sad
i am just giving sadness
you could know
it's not the same vibration
intention
next time
you maybe complain
this happening to me if i am doing all
well that's
that's
because you are just complaining remember
the universe doesn't have any ethics or moral the universe only see energy
vibration
if you are given sadness you will receive sadness just to understand
the universe is just trying to fill the voids with the same energy
went away
it's trying to reach the balance
what you do is if you are given sadness the universe will give sadness
sadness was in the same vibration okay
makes it makes me understand
if i am willing to receive joy i have to give joy
balance
is very important
fundamental to understand
the circuits work
remember
we are not only one emotion in our body we are many in each one of the chakras we have different types of vibration also we have to acknowledge if
emotion is coming or or
thing
i am giving is coming from the intestines that's coming from the head from
level
is not about um if i want to feel joy
i have to give joy
i will be happy no it's not like
it's about to realize
what i need is
i don't have in between all of them
it's not to become myself all happy constantly it's about to use my own energy okay
use it to create joy
let's make an example of
i can use a different energy to create a higher vibration to receive
other energy
new energy
i don't have
this is to laugh of your own disgrace your own conflict
i take my lower vibration my suffering
i make it into a humor monologue suddenly i create
lower vibration into laugh into joy
i receive joy
usually happens in people
that has depression
sorry
the comedian the comedian people comedian usually are not happy people the comedians usually they are suffering
they usually suffer depression in their lives
what they are doing is try to raise their vibration constantly to keep alive through taking the sadness
turning it into laughs laughter
what happened usually with many of the comedians
they are um unaware unconscious
they use
same energy of happiness
they receive
they don't know
to handle it
so they create more depression
um if you become aware you use
energy to wake up
two of the most clear examples for the whole world in
is robin williams he went down
jim carrey going up
is something
happens to all of us normally besides these examples
is
we can use a dense energy to create another energy a new energy
let's remember
try to understand
level let's picture
when i create
when i recognize
circuit of giving
receiving if i am unaware if i am unconscious i receive
energy
i am afraid
i may lose it
i keep it to myself
this is full
and i am
afraid
afraid to give him
i don't want to lose it
i don't give i just retain
what happened
energy starts to stuck
stuck i start to receive all
energy
i can i have
much
much
i don't know
to do with
all
that i cannot process
do you usually send all the things
you eat
you cannot process
something is really difficult to be processed
where does it go to deliver the liver tries to process
information
do you know
the liver does in your body it assimilates all
information as part of your personality
once
energy was processed as information as part of yourself of your own information maybe
are some parts of
energy
is not being able to be processed
that is turned into another energy
we call anger
we call rage
we call hate it goes all to the liver
the rest
was possessed it's taken as a as a nutrient to nourish the the body
where does it goes
thing
is being processed to be assimilated it goes to the pancreas it goes to the stomach
there it stays it becomes part of myself
that energy is not mine remember
was an energy
i received to do something
then give it away
because i was afraid to lose it i retain it inside myself
what
means
the energy
i have within right
is not in resonance with me is in resonance with the object or the subject from
it came from
does it generates in the quantum level a link of attachment do you follow
do we explain
is
energy
is inside of me doesn't belongs to me
i was i was just supposed to receive the energy to do something to create something
then leave it away
because i keep it inside it still is related with the outside we will always need for for the external energy in a world
we uh in a world like
in a physical world okay
uh
we are interacting in a network usually these nutrients
we are going to receive from the outer world
create ourselves will be coming from the food from emotions
from thoughts
all
energy is something
i take i transform
i give away take transform
give away a simple example i have an apple i take the apple from the tree i eat it
the apple gives me everything
i need in my body
the rest
i don't need i give it back to the earth with the shape of okay
i just simply it giving
receiving giving
receiving the apple
i ate becomes compost for the tree
in the emotional level we usually
we are supposed to do is i meet someone i get in love okay
that person loves me gives me its love i activate
love i feel it
suddenly it activates many things within me
then i supposedly have to deliver back saying i love you giving
energy again to the person okay through the mind for example i meet someone we discuss about something
that person gives me an idea
i process
idea i think about the idea i absorb every idea
then i transform it within like in a new kind of concept
i give it back i deliver again in the chat talking about oh
is my thinking about
you have talked to me hmm everything is just a cycle
someone was asking about the negative the negative is not bad it's just another energy okay try to picture
that it's not it's also it's not good to have a lot of positive energy within
the positive energy it makes the machine constantly work constantly
you lose a lot of energy
you are constantly working with the energy it goes
fast the negative energy
it does to slow make the machine work slower
also the negative energy can stop the machine at all at the end
is
both of them are necessary that's
it's
important
circuit constantly
let's go to
it means to be attached to an energy
picture
idea you eat the apple
suddenly your body is afraid to leave away the apple by going to the bathroom
you are afraid
you don't know
you're going to eat anymore
suddenly you hold the apple inside
imagine
you have received love lots of love
suddenly the relationship ends
you say to yourself i don't know if i'm going to be able to love again i don't know if i am even beloved again
what i do i just hold the love
emotion inside
i'm afraid to leave it away
for example with a belief it also happened i receive an idea i transform the idea
suddenly i say if i say
everyone will believe
i'm crazy
i better shut up i don't give anything
i made it i believe the simple aspect to understand
this process of energy works is just by
you eat you eat something digestive process nutrients stay in your body
then cheat it goes away
process is constant in the physical the mental
the emotional level if i eat i receive i make the process of digest the digestive process i take take the nutrients take the nutrients
i don't do it i don't leave it away i don't give it away
it stopped
it gets
stopped
in the physical level for example i get addicted to something i would eat
in the physical level we can relate
with i cannot live away i cannot leave away um
energy
i am attached to a food for example
maybe chocolate for example i need chocolate to keep living
i need chocolate i need chocolate or also a drug okay you become addicted to some drug whatever whatever you ingest something physical
you became addict to addicted to in the emotional level is in relation with a person or a situation
for example in a situation maybe i put myself in a situation constantly once
again
it makes me feel safe even if i know
it makes me bad
for example in the emotional with a person you had a very deep love with someone okay
it was terrible
it ended
you will look for different people
will remind you to
first love
you could still be living the same that's an addiction to an emotion for example um
you in the in the mind
the ideas it's like you had a belief
makes you feel good
you
know
it's not good
even though you are attached to
and you go
you go once
again to the same belief even if you know
it makes you bad i'm not speaking about things
i feel attached to
they makes us fine i'm speaking about things
i do
i know
they make me bad
i do it anyway
basically is to repeat something
i know
makes me bad
for example um
we talk about music you cannot be addicted to music for example it's like maybe you love music
you need music to live
it doesn't make you bad to just love music it's like saying i love family
i love to be with my family that's not an attachment that's just i'm loving my family
when do you realize
is an attachment
you want to go with your family even if they are shouting each other screaming each other
they make you bad
you still want to be with them the moment i detach from something
i was attached to is not by saying i just don't want
anymore
i leave the way i cut
relation no it's not
the moment i really detach from something is
i go to the origin of
i started to enjoy
why i started to suffer with
so the example
i gave today in the blog was if the chords of my guitar are entangled
they are not sounding very well
i i won't go
just cut the chords to solve the problem
i am supposed to do is to recognize
chord is the one
is attached
then go to the origin
adjust it
it's not about to cut the cords it's about to adjust the cords by finding the origin of
chord
for example
i am feeling
i cannot love someone
was the first relationship
i had in
i felt
i wouldn't be able to love someone else
this is not the month to make the adjustment
just adjust adjustment adjustment
is the month to recognize the chords
that's the list for today
things i feel
i am attached to
which things i think i feel
i detached to
i detached from sorry
let's do the alignment to go to the to anchor the plexus
i am in the plexus okay
so we could work with us the vibration we are going to use today
the statement for today is i am the mystery of unity
everything is connected i am the emissary of unity
the note of today the code
we will work today is the note la sharp or c flat it's the passing tone between la
c in the chromatic scale is um chromatic scale is b flat
is the alphabetic notation oh no sorry cb mode um yeah uh
in the alphabetic notation is uh a sharp or b flat its bridge is the connection beyond the physical body aligned to the spiritual mind for for
its frequency resonates in the crown chakra
irradiates the breach of platinum cord
unites material unites material
spiritual remember sit properly comfortable stretch the body yawn massage the body caress the body honor the body for being the anchor of the spiritual in the matter relax the body focusing in the breathing
take a deep breath
go with the oxygen through your nose your lungs heart blood organs
muscles i take a moment to feel the heat within my body going outside through my skin filling up my magnetical field my aura be aware of the light of the i am over your head
bring all the energy with your imagination from around the body going in a spiral
making the i am brighter
brighter take a deep breath i feel
recognize the light of the i am coming down going through the crown of beliefs the center of my head filled with qualities my throat of truth my heart
its service
how it shines going down filling up all my plexus take a deep breath i recognize
become aware
in
center are united all the links
connect me with the outer world i become aware
it's all
energy
creates my personality i observe the energy from the core of my plexus shining out with the streams
links like if they are an octopus jellyfish i recognize
all the links
i have all the attachments
i perceive are just the reaction of my incapacity to give to live away to let it go i recognize
all these links
i have are not something i must cut they are just unbalanced links
energy
i need to take back to the equilibrium i just simply observe
recognize the links the attachments
i have i recognize them take a deep breath
bring all the light of the i am to the plexus to bring clarity
consciousness to all these links
attachments
creates my personality take a deep breath
start to pronounce the vibration expanding the light of the i am transforming the pause of
octopus of energy into brighter rays of light like a brighter sun yes
in its light i recognize i am the emissary of unity for every link are connected to me
only me from my infinite potential i am ever able to balance them i am the emissary of unity i am the emissary of unity
my message is
i have to recognize
each one of these links has given me something to learn
now i must be able to also learn
to give i am the emissary of unity i take my hands to my heart i recognize
every attachment
detachment find in summary word in the process of learning
being for everything
i give
receive everything
is inside

from my heart i bring all
consciousness towards all my body caressing stretching massaging
yawning
i come back
and
opening my eyes
like
we have the energy of the ion in the plexus

detachments no judgment on them just write it down drink a lot of water
rest a lot thank you for being
and see you tomorrow at the same time good night
