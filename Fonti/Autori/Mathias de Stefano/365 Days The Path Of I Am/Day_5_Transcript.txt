now we go to the code of the day
today it is contemplation related to the process of experimentation thus the moment of observation arrives in the middle of the experience of acknowledging
it feels things generates in every act every movement every attitude the most the moment of reflection the moment of thinking
this is the information of today is related to realizing
after the cosmos had experienced everything
it has to stop to watch to contemplate
to think about everything
it has experienced
these are the main informations
we are going to work with today
let's let's begin
uh it doesn't matter exactly the position if you can be in the position of the tetrahedron is better
just be relaxed
the most important thing is to be straight like
seated
no no laying down okay
i'm putting the music
we start as always doing the massage
carries in our bodies remember
doing
massage is just to let the body know
i am going to download information from the i am
this is for its higher for its um for the best of its body towards the body i discharge the energy i can yawn i can stretch i look for the most comfortable position
softly i start to relax my body leaving the weight closing my eyes
i focus only in my breathing i breathe in slowly by the nose hold the air in the lower part of the lungs
then i leave the air going out slowly by the nose i go with my imagination besides the oxygen aside the oxygen through the lungs the heart going through all my blood towards each organ
each muscle as i go through my body i try to recognize
part of my body hurts it's feeling uncomfortable or feels pleasure just be aware of
part i recognize
part of my body i watch it observe it i recognize
it feels rhythm i recognize
the parts of my body
are hot
those
are cold
is the energy i observe the part of my body
is feeling hotter or colder the one
is calling my attention the most without judgment i allow myself to feel the emotion
i find in
part of my body breathe in very deep
right
without thinking no judgment i take the first idea thinking thought
i
i have right
no judgment it can be something silly i breathe in very deep with my hands or my imagination i take
part of my body
emotion
this thought as if they are spheres of light
i put them at the high of my stomach my plexus i contemplate the three of them together without much thinking i tried to give some meaning to
these three together breathe in very deep oh i take these three with my hands
push them to the core in my pancreas i recognize
that these three tools are those
my being had gifted me to nourish the seed of myself just for today i become aware of the light of my higher self over my head
with very deep breathings i make it descend through all the activated chakras i observe
light any color coming down through my crown my third eye my throat
my heart i contemplate
this chakras irradiates towards every direction
i bring the light towards the three spheres of my plexus i begin to disintegrate the three spheres with the light of my arm softly i do
until i feel them being one absorbed by the seed of my plexus i become aware
these tools are nourishing the seed of my personality i recognize
this is the center
creates the links between each one of the persons
i know i recognize
that everything
i believe i am is a projection from the outside
every projection from the outside towards the outside is just
i believe from
take a deep breath i set the intention to stop being the projections of who i believe i am to become who i am who i really am
with the intention
the light of the i am i start to see
the seed starts to blossom in a beautiful yellow flower
assign the send information i start to activate my plexus yes yey i can i can be i can be for i am the portal of the self i am the portal of the self i am the portal of the self i see
the network is blossoming in yellow flowers all over the right the network around the whole planet as the echoes of the i am i recognize
the eye is such as important as the arm i recognize
my personality is my tool
and
i become aware
the ego is the tool towards my action i am i can i am the portal of the self take a deep breath
very softly i start to caress the body to discharge the energy from my plexus towards the earth like a race make a massage to the body i stretch anyone i start to open my eyes coming back
