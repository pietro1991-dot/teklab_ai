hi everyone
are you
welcome to
hour to try to solve a little bit of everything
happened
this uh weak let's remember
this day today ends the first week
is dedicated to the mind
is
maybe uh the conversation the conversations i had between i
am were very from the mind
is maybe
while reading
uh these conversations you have to think too much um
we are working with the mind in
week the main idea of the conversations between i
am
you are reading the blog we're straight to straight to help us work to break the idea of our mind the patterns
we had in our mind in our beliefs
i hope it was useful
first of all i'm going to try to read some of the questions
in the chat um
first i am not going to answer anything
is not related to
we are doing right
so if you ask stuff about the moon the aliens
so on i won't answer about
this is not just any questions is about
we are doing okay perfect uh she was asking about
she is shaking
connecting with the higher self
this is
is a new energy coming down into your body
the nervous system is trying to adapt to
so the whole body starts to try to to understand
it's happening
it's feeling it in all the parts
that's the shaking it's normal to feel dizzy
the reason
maybe you feel dizzy is
when you download
information it's like opening your perspective of everything
you are used to just one the one you are looking at
this is
it's
difficult to to to to adapt to
new reality
your third eye
to feel everything
to perceive everything
this is
uh maybe you feel like uh dc
you feel everything opening
some chakras feel stronger
the experience can be
hard to handle like crying non-stop with the knees or pain
some are
flowy well the reason
um
some of them are harder is
we stuck energy
it's like the energy is not flowing
so it's stuck okay
uh
you clean
part of the energy
energy
was stuck is not eliminated it's not erased is flowing it starts to move
this energy
was stuck
it starts to flow
all the emotions start to be felt
emotion is energy
when we are cleaning our body it starts to flow
to allow us to feel
other ones are more clear
the energy is flowing constantly
it's easier
the question of
person is
she's not feeling anything no neither the chakras neither the i am
just seeing colors uh
is she doing wrong
uh according to
question um the um the thing is
uh
it doesn't matter if you are not feeling or seeing or perceiving anything
you are just
trying to do something um i know
are
are many people
are connecting feeling stuff watching stuff
don't worry about it don't worry it's just different perceptions as i said in spanish it's like going to a concert
someone is paying attention to an instrument another one to the singer another one is paying attention to paying attention to whatever is around them
um don't panic if you don't feel anything just connect with your own experience remember
what we are doing is not to feel to channel anything
we are doing is just to with imagination work in ourselves that's it okay
this person was um um said
someone in in her house saw like a dark one as a dark spirit
meditations
she was afraid
what i was saying is
it's normal
you are opening to another levels of consciousness to receive um to open
um spectrum to see other realities
sometimes well mostly
we do
the first ones are being seen or perceived are the dark ones
they are closer to the matter
it's easier for them to to to appear
um usually
we feel them is
we are related to them
we have something in common with them
first of all
i want to say is
they are just another spirits we we have been taught to fear darkness
darkness are just souls
spirits
are
working doing their lives
so on exactly like we do
we don't have to fear them
we have to do is to recognize
i am feeling
person
i am afraid of
person of
being uh
always to the questions to myself like
how
now
so on okay some person were saying um i don't know
to pronounce the vibration of the day some people were saying about
the the i don't know
to pronounce the vibration of the day
don't worry if you don't know
to pronounce it if you know the mantra of the day i am such whatever um that's the most important thing the vibration is just another tool okay
helps also i will just pick the the ones i i can read
there are
many
i am not um helping myself to to go with all of them um she was asking about if it's possible to do these alignments with someone or a baby a child besides a side
i was saying yes of course there's no problem to do
um
remember
it's only for you don't do it for anyone if
person doesn't know okay um she was saying
she doesn't have or he doesn't have the time to assimilate to integrate
understand everything
i am posting every day
if the meditations are useful anyway or not
the meditations are useful anyway if you do it for yourself to balance yourself
so on
don't worry about the information the information can be integrated in many years maybe some people are saying i understood
right
but no they didn't maybe in i don't know uh three years they will catch the information again
say oh
i got it
don't worry each one has its own time to stand stuff okay
don't force it
the question was
i said um
in order to have a complete process uh we have to leave the positive
the negative aspects of the twelve constellations
what does it mean to um leave the negative side
i was explaining
the whole pattern of creation has 12 different aspects of the i am
we can call the constellations
these 12 must do a path towards the outside
a path towards the inside
these two paths are called the positive
the negative one of the things
we have to do is to eliminate the idea or to transcend the idea better of um negative is equals to
or to something wrong okay negative is not bad negative is an is a inner process okay
towards the outside the process of these 12 must be related to the mind to the emotion
to the action
going in is related with the tools of wisdom will
love if i have start right
with the meditations do i should i do all the others
i didn't do the question was um
should i do if i am starting right
and i want to do everything should i do the first ones
i didn't do
the answer is
of course you have to do the other ones
you you don't have to go for the whole meditation you just take five minutes
think about the first chakra
breathe in deep
just picture the flower opening
say the mantra i the statement i am blah blah okay
then breathe out
then you go to the other one breathe in
i am the portal of blah blah blah breathe out
go to the next one
so on in just five minutes you can do it
it's just to have the alignment of all of them
we keep moving okay uh
they said um uh i am feeling a lot of energy
emotions
i cannot control it
i can handle them
it's normal
we are downloading information
of course it um it it it makes
everything
you have inside tries to out all
energy all
emotion
it's normal
in
next 10 days we are going to work with the um with the emotional aspect of
so don't worry okay uh we are going to balance it
the question was if i have um negative emotions
feelings
are nourishing the seed is
good or is
bad no it's not bad
the earth needs these nutrients in order to nourish the seeds to blossom
it's like in the farms is good for the plants okay
all the bad emotions everything
are
we think is not good it is for the nature okay
what we have to do is to give another is to give another meaning
a purpose to
energy we are not going to get rid of it
we need to use it in another thing
energy of course in
work
we are doing you can feel much more emotions
all of
was hidden within you okay
it's normal
you maybe feel
um those feelings
we are cleaning the whole body of
emotion
now activate it
now you can see it feel it okay
it's normal
you did you feel
so we have to use it for the seats they were asking um
happened if i cannot go to a temple every day for a reason
the task of the temples of going into the temple it was something
i asked for uh to the people
are willing to help to spread
energy towards the unconditional the
towards the unconscious level of the network
um it's not something
you have to do every day is something
you have to do
you can
you feel it's not an obligation it's just an another task
you can do whatever you feel um the question was
am i feeling
tired
exhausted
i did some of the meditations uh
do i do with
situation
we need to understand
the body process
assimilates the new information through sleeping
this is like the normal day
you are doing your thing uh in your in your daily life um you are constantly taking information from everything
happens
what you are going to do
that is going to sleep
you feel tired
during
process your body is processing all
information okay
this is
when we do something
brings new information into our body the body feels tired
it needs to process
information
if you feel tired just rest don't force yourself to think
why i'm feeling tired okay it's just normal
you're assimilating new information i'm learning
to use
so i don't know if the question is
there
the question was if uh the alignment of
we are doing for the i am it will help to the purpose
mission
we have together for the um the new time
i was explaining
yes of course the purpose
mission
we have is to reconnect the network of consciousness
we are going to work all together to do
in february 2022
in
year in
month we are going to make a connection all of us to work with the whole i am
we need as much people as possible aligned in the coherence with the iron
we can do it properly
of course
alignment has a purpose
this whole year
the connection of
network will allow us to download information
we could build the idea of a new society of the projects
are coming in the future
do i know
i am aligning myself
the question of uh
do i know if i am aligned um well if you feel different if you are feeling emotions
you never expressed you are doing some actions
you don't usually do
if you are feeling changes even if it's good or bad for you if you are feeling something even if you are not aligned as you thought you were supposed to that's something that's a clue to tell you
you are on the path
you are trying to to be aligned
sounds changing you
we are just doing 10 days inside of the process of 360 days
step by step
what happens if i am not understanding the relation between the the spheres uh the three spheres
we are working with um
if i don't get the the idea in
precise moment don't worry
you don't have to think about it it's just if it comes your mind must connect the information if you if your mind is not connecting
just breathe deep hold it
exhale everything
you don't need about it just let it go don't worry okay don't think much about it we are just trying to make the exercise of allowing our mind to figure the things without thinking just perceiving
it's a press
question do we need to change our diet
limit alcohol of course
should be always um of course uh
would be better to change our diet
we do
but don't force it don't don't make yourself don't push yourself to do something
uh in just one day
you maybe are not used to just go slowly step by step okay as always don't push yourself to do something you are not used to okay
the best diet you can you can take for
is um is vegetarian okay
uh we are trying to download light from
i am
we need in our blood the information of
to download blood like plants does
that's
we need
information
alcohol is like statics for the information
it's not really good for
more water okay uh
would be better
don't push to
so
question says uh you explained once
um you didn't work for light neither for darkness
the main goal is to behold in neutral um do you recommend
also for our path is
both to bring heaven on earth like
and i said that's the only way you can download heaven on earth by being neutral
we have to understand
the third dimension is like being in the darkness
the fifth dimension is like being in the light
if we are pushing each other against like in a fight
some people living in the fifth
some people just living in the third is like uh not integrity not integration we need to put both together
that's the neutral
this means to acknowledge the beautiful of
darkness
we are living in
also to bring clarity the coherence to
reality
we have built
both together must live together must be one
that's
we are working for neutrality
neither for light neither for the darkness just neutral
this question i guess it says um can we mix the different practices is is okay
and i said of course it's okay of course is useful
um
information
we are working with is just to settle the i am inside ourselves
the i am is expressed in
many different ways in
many different techniques
different tools
it doesn't matter
one you use it will help also if you feel
so feel free to do everything
you
you have um to help yourself to to be yourself
the question was
someone made an abortion um
um
happens with
energy
we are coming
we are bringing
she didn't brought
spirit into life
i said
um
is the same for the people
lost some organ
doesn't have maybe i don't know some glands or whatever they need the twice the effort of of settle of setting the energy in
part of the body okay you need to bring
information
energy many times more harder to
you don't have the anchor the physical anchor of
and in case of an abortion
i would
i would share is
um bring
energy
let it out of your body like if you are giving birth like um imitating the the moment of giving birth
the light
the energy
emotion can go out even if you are not um having a baby okay to clean the channel says sorry
i am still confused
about
is your soy
is i am does it mean
we are just part of a bigger self or are we processes of becoming a kind of creator too all of
all of
so i am is a concept
helps us to understand
each one of us is just a projection of only one thing
to understand
i am you need to picture a sphere okay you have a sphere
each point of the sphere each tiny little atom of
sphere
that shapes the sphere is at the same distance to one spot in the center of the sphere okay just in the center
this means
uh
means
every one of the other dots of these spheres are the projection of one sphere
has the potential of the rest okay
it means
we are like a mirror of the first one
is in the core in the center
this means
inside of us each one of us has a different perspective
in a sphere i am
looking up
the other one is
looking down
the other one is
looking
way
we all have different perspectives
one origin in the center
this means each one of us even if we have different perspective we have the same potential to become a new center for a new universe
the concept of i am is we are all projections of one bigger self
we are ourselves the core for a new one
if we do it properly we can become creators of a new sphere i hope
clarifies
uh we are
uh 303 thousand
700 people connected uh
i'm sorry if i am not able to answer to all the questions
i am trying to um to answer as many as possible to clarify the main idea of
we are doing i will try to do more of
uh to answer some of the questions
i will try to to do it more organized
i have pisces rising right
so i'm not very organized just flowing i saw the some people um
um uh asking uh uh
144
do we have to leave 144 lives according to
i wrote
it's a long uh uh issue to discuss right
but um
i'm going to try to do is explain it back in another video in another time
you have the information okay
let's start with our task of today
is the toroid
remember
that we are
working with the mental aspects
today we are closing the mental aspect of
month
now we start with the emotional one
we start with a physical one
this means
today we are closing the work with toroid shape
it has within every one of the chakras we worked with
let's remember
the toroid is like an apple it has the shape of an apple
we are in the center of
apple
what we are going to do today is to have inside to integrate the work
we have done in
um in
10 days remember
what i wrote today is related to the concept i am the mind
um i wrote today about the mind
the concept
is related with
torus is
everything
we have within is a construction of the spiritual mind
spirit
mind are not different things according to the ancient ones they are the same
the mind
creates is the spirit itself okay
this is
in along these days
we had to do was to understand to to comprehend uh the uh the concepts
shaped my reality through the mind
that's
it were all concepts
we had to understand through the mind
let's read the information of the day today
let's start with the meditation
today remember is the last day of the week of the mind in the month of the constellation of leo
it's i am aspect is icon the vibration of the day is
uh the vibration means m the portal
the h is a sound
helps the other consonant to stay in time
the m portal
h is related to the eternity the eternal aspect of reality
this is
the statement for today is i am the portal or the portal to eternity the code of today is inhalation in the process of transcendence
it says the universe breathes again
time knowing
everything
has some
has meaning
everything
has meaning in reality it never existed it was only a dream the beauty of everything
lied already in itself
for
it's no longer forms colors or sounds
inspire it
the simple consciousness or conscience
everything was its own reflection
this is related with the mind
it means
of course
it expressed it experienced
integrated everything
it understands
everything
exists is just a projection
now it understands
everything was just mind
for
it can let everything go that's transcendence
let's go to connect with
information remember we sit in a comfortable position
