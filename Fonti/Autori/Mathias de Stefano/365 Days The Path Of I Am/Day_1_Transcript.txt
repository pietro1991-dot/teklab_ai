hi everyone welcome all of you to
first day of
360 days we're gonna be seeing each other
is the first day of the of the conscience year in
we are going to be working in the coherence of the beam of the self i was explaining today in another video
uh everything
we are going to do
year is about to be conscious
to be coherent
the main goal of
year is the connection
the the flow of
connection in between the mind the motion
the physical oops
we could be all aligned as one as one consciousness
is written in the in in the part of uh task
alignment in the blog if you go inside the calendar you will have
the information day by day of
are we going to work with each day
if you are not able to do it at
time with us all together you just can't do it any time of the day you want the important thing is
you take just a few minutes to think about
as many we are all connected in the same task every day the consciousness the pattern of the cons or the pattern of the consciousness will be more wide
um
it's better than than being just one
separated individuals
as i was explaining in another video remember
we are going to work with
12th month okay
in these 12 months will be each one of them divided in three weeks of 10 days these three weeks will represent the mental body the emotional body
the physical body
each one of the 10 days in each week will represent a chakra we are going to work with we have to remember
the reason
we start today with
year is
we are aligned right
with the beginning of the year um of the start of series
is today the first day in
from the pyramids it appears again
a few months without being seen
it represents the beginning of the year the reason
we do it aligned from
from the pyramids is
we are going to
this place was the first one on being um creating the network of consciousness around the world
we are going to use
ancient system
we could um take benefit of
structure
from
we can create a new one a transcendental one i must tell you
we are going to work from the upper chakras to below
our goal is to download information from the skies into the matter into the earth not uploading the information
to download information
we could leave heaven on earth another thing
we are going to work with is the music the vibration
gigi
other people
were working with him
um we were working all together to create
music
helps us to be aligned constantly any time of the day
we could be aligned
this alignment you can find it in the blog in a part
says radio on the side if you are in the computer or below in the lower part of the blog if you are in the phone it would be constantly repeating every 30 minutes is
you could be connected all the time you want the base of
sound is the heartbeat
um [Music] these uh sounds
um the sounds the main bass is the the heartbeat
it could be helping us to be aligned with the heartbeat of the cosmos
we are all vibrating as one
we can work with the alignments all as one being by listening to the same music the same um the same heartbeat we enter all of us in the same post
this is
and
is
this is the music we are going to use for
alignment each month the music will be switching transforming itself according to the work we are doing in
month we are going to to to read a bit the the structure of every day uh
so we could know exactly
we are going to do in each um in each day um we're having troubles with connection
in giza the light has been shutting down uh the whole day
um it's something i can't i can fix um it's happening all around
it will be recorded anyway let's going to understand the structure of today
is going to be replayed in each one of the days from the conception of
calendar from
day today until the end of
month
we are working on
calendar will be the month of leo the constellation of leo it's not
we are going to work with the constellation of leo
because we are going to work with the concept of the i am of leo the concept of the i am for leo
this whole month will be the i can um
month is called hol lak holak means the first cycle in atlantic atlantean language
each month will have these names the first cycle the second cycle the third cycle
the names will be of course in atlantean hollac holsu holdis
so on until holbada
which means the 12th site cycle will be related to a concept of the i am the first cycle related to the constellation of leo is the i can
we will have a vibration of the day the reason of the uh vibration of the day is not
you have to do it precisely like
but it's like a guide for people
doesn't know
to flow at first
they need a point to begin [Music]
the vibration of the day today is ma
is uh not the constant sound
we have to do the whole day
it's just a way to enter the vibration until we start to flow okay
the vibration of the day we have the statement the statement is something
materialize an idea
it's like the verb
is materializing the intention
the statement
will help us
will help us to do is to manifest the intention of the mind the most important thing for the whole month is the mantra the mantra is i can for the whole month a mantra is a sound
has a specific intention
along
whole month
we are going to try to activate is
i can through the mind i can through the motion
i can through the body
you find task the the part of the task is um like an indication of
do you have to do or a suggestion of
you can do um at any time of the day just for five minutes as much um whenever you wake up or whenever you go to sleep or along the whole day anytime just to be aligned with all of us
is another task
i was suggesting for people
resonate with
that if you feel
you can go to a temple
activate the mantra
this is just if you're a sound with
uh not
is just if you respond with it not
not if it's not the task specific task
the reason
we are going to work with temples of any religion um is
uh they represent in the unconscious a portal in between the um the the social network of the divine
everyone even if they don't believe they know
they are portals to the heavens the only thing
the thing
we are going to do is just with um respect to the place to activate the mantra i am i can whatever of
day
just let it flow in the in the space towards the unconscious network if the temples are closed it's easy don't go if you want to go anyway from outside it doesn't matter should be a temple
is active right
or can be a pyramid or a temple from the past doesn't matter anyway all counts the only thing
that is important is
our places
people believes or think
our portals towards the the divine the network of the divine
that is to help to to spread the the the consciousness uh in the unconscious network
the last thing we have
is the code of the day the code of the day is just information to it's just information to recognize um different aspects
compose
that made us be okay they will be divided in concepts of 12 12 12
12.
okay it's just information
you can do whatever you want with
this is just information to recognize
i am
too i am part of
all
said we have to we go to today today is the first day of the month hollak related to leo
so the mantra of
month is i can the vibration of the day is ma
vibration represents the door of the spirit m means door
a means spirit
is
the statement of today is i am the portal of the spiritual mind
day is related with the portal of the spiritual mind
is the crown chakra each day we are going to be sharing through social media the information of each day
what we are going to do
in the image you have the body with the chakras
the constellation behind even if you don't know the name of the chakra you will see the color
the location in your body you have the map of your body in the image
you just relate to the energy of
part of your body just the basis to understand
is the portal of the spiritual mind each chakra in our body is a portal the portal of the crown chakra is open towards the spirit for the ancient cultures
ancient wisdom spirit
mind is the same
it's the mind of the spirit
is coming down we in our time divided spirit
mind
they are the same they are not different things
represents each chakra represents a portal
it has two sides one positive
one negative
it allows the energy to move through it the reason
i said
that um do
in a uh besides uh or together with a plant is
the plants are natural portals natural channels
uh if you don't know
to do it just by being close by one you start to have to you start to vibrate
resound with it
so it helps
the code of the day today is the inspiration the code of today is inhalation
is related with expression according to the no time story
the universe originated from the void contemplated everything
it was able to generate on the exterior on the outside it's a process related to the future to post potentialities
and talks about the instant of epiphany
creative inspiration every inspiration is an idea
originates from the dream of the mind you just have
information just let it go
let go through your body
day is the only day
i am going to explain all
okay by voice uh the all the rest of the days i will go straight to the point to work
