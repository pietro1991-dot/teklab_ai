hello everybody good morning good afternoon 
good evening um so welcome to the day of 
um the day of uh the root chakra 
in the mental week in the month of Aries 
and I hope it ends 
right now because I was thinking that the questions would be very much easier 
than it's being right now so this is my face right now trying to 
think how to explain uh the post for today 
so I I ask you 
please read the post for today because I don't 
know if I'm gonna be able to do this to do this explanation so and 
you don't want for my higher selves to come and explain this because he doesn't have any pedagogy uh so 
um uh so I rather explain this with my 
personality and in the meantime you you can have fun trying to see how I try 
to explain this so the question for today it was so easy I thought it was so easy 
um the question was how much so 
whenever we hear the question how much the first thing that comes to our mind is 
about things about physical money 
um yes Goods that you can value 
so when we say how much we think about the amount of things that we can 
um that we can achieve that we can have can hold or whatever so 
to understand the ancient perception of why we use the word how much we have to 
go again to the etymology to see how we are gonna 
understand and use this term so we'll begin with the question 
how much can you see it 
good this 
[Music] so from where it comes how much it comes 
from and Mel 
so looking into how much the origin remember is again remember the word quo 
it means object and Mel means 
to grow to expand 
which gave the word mul 
in Latin the word mul that then was transformed in multi 
hmm so multus is like Malto 
like in Latin languages a lot 
and the pronunciation of the T 
is changed in the Latin languages like mult mulch that's why 
the sound mulch then this one disappear 
and we have much like in Spanish mucho 
um okay so that's the origin of that word so we 
can just know that detail so remember also for you to know in 
English um the the word cuanto in Spanish 
um like in other languages too um 
um Latin languages comes from meaning is the participle part of the 
word state or to be participle thank you thank you 
so um so so of what to be 
um to stay in one place is the space that occupies an object 
that is that's what it means in Spanish cuanto the space that occupies 
an object good okay this is the easy part 
the word in Latin 
you say quantum 
so Quantum would be the concert so is the concept of us of a of an object of a 
thing that occupies a space a place 
okay so here we have 
the singular aspect of quantum which is Quanto is a 
tiny thing one thing and quanta is the plural 
so at cuanto means 
the minimum space that something occupies 
so this is the concept Quantum is the concept of the space 
that something is occupying and cuanto speaks about the tiny 
space of this object this object what space takes this 
object so we have the concepts how much and 
quantum Latin 
so now let's think like in the ancient times the in the European people 
each one of these is a Quan 
okay is an object so let's say that a pen is a quote this is a quote 
so here we have two more core pens that are 
equal to this one okay so when I put one aside the other one 
I have three equal equal things which in the thought of the in the 
European language they would say 
is repeating and occupying the same the space three times 
this quote is occupying three times a space 
okay do you understand now the the vision of the language 
so in this language people wouldn't say there is 
three pens in this language they would say this pen 
occupies three spaces 
just about languages so now when in the past they would ask 
how many pens are there they wouldn't say how many pens they 
would say they would say objects 
spaces spaces object 
that's the question okay 
so that's why we have how much 
how much is one object in many spaces 
okay so with the evolution of the language now to each one of this will be called 
acuanto This is a Quanto another cuanto another cuanto so I have three quantos 
here so the conjunction of all of them will be 
called a quantity um a quantity of things 
so now when we are in the past exchanging things I have these three and 
this one that is bigger so it's bigger so it has more things so 
it it has much more value so this is a cuanto one thing aquan okay it's one thing 
so I have three but this one here one wants to exchange will ask 
cuando so this means how much how much 
it seems a silly thing what I'm saying right now but it's the basis to 
understand the quantum mechanics [Laughter] so okay 
um so [Music] 
again this silly thing this has a value 
and the value is equal to this so it is equivalent this value is equivalent to 
these two okay so that's why when I know that this is a Quant a how 
and these two are equals to this how when we are trying to buy and sell 
things this word how becomes a question how much 
meaning things 
value okay that's the question of of 
how much it's not something that is indented or etherical is the quantity of 
things so we relate this question to how much to 
money so we speak about a coin for example so we have a coin yes and this 
coin is equal has the same value is equivalent to three pens or one bottle 
of water so with the same coin I can buy this or 
this it doesn't matter it's equivalent 
so we explained this in the economy video um this bill here 
has the same value of these three pens like for this bottle of water 
so the key here is to understand that the value of things is according 
to the space that the things occupy in this 
in the Earth or in a space okay 
so this means that through thousands of years we use the concept of 
Quantum of how much related to physical things on earth 
so this makes that through thousands of years 
in the market that people use the word Quantum to describe the quantity of 
things of how many things occupy many spaces 
that would be um so from the market the concept of 
quantum for selling starts to be also part of the Alchemy and Physicians 
why Physicians meaning doctors why because the doctors the Physicians 
used to go to the market to buy for a Quantum of plants a Quantum of this 
element a Quantum of these minerals in order to do 
a poison a portion a portion in order to 
do a medicine for people so they start to mix the things and to 
use the term quantum for the amount of elements or the 
quantity that you use for these elements to create a portion to create 
a medicine so quantum 
is what we today call a dose of something 
so through centuries of practice of Commerce with 
with things with physical things occupying a space 
Here Comes not only the Commerce not only the 
medicine but also now the experimentation of things 
so they start to ask themselves about how 
much it takes for one thing to transform into another 
so the process that things take in order to change 
so we start to use the the word how much to 
Define also time hmm how much time it takes for one element 
to make a reaction how much time it takes for something to become something different 
so the measurement of time is also 
measured by how much so now we have both space and time 
divided into minimum quantums which is unities of space and unities of 
time so the word Quantum Quanto 
starts to define the minimum Unity 
that can measure space and can measure time 
this is why the science starts to use the term quantum or cuanto 
in order to measure the tiniest part of time or space 
for the energy to move or for a thing to transform 
is in this way in which we start to measure 
and to quantify the energy 
so when the science starts to discover the electrons the energy itself and the 
things that are inside of the particles of the electrons like 
the tiniest thing like the quarks 
that are inside of the protons and nutrients when they discovered this tiny little 
parts they start to measure matter according to that and that's called the quantum 
because it's the tiniest part that can be measured 
so as you see as you see we started like 30 000 years 
ago measuring things in the in the European times with 
measuring fruits and vegetables and parts of animals 
the quantum as a big thing and then 2000 2500 years ago 
um um the empires growing they started to use the quantum to measure the Commerce 
around the the countries and they started to make it into medicine and so 
smaller and smaller and smaller until they they figure out that this is a 
Quantum but what is made of so how many how many of this are here 
inside so they started to look more and more deep and deep in until they found out 
the smallest particle that was able to be measured 
so that's why they call that the quantum world the quantum reality 
is the Chinese thing that we can measure from the biggest one to the small one 
so this was started to use in order to measure the quantity 
of electrons that you need in order to make a electrical current 
to understand how it works they started 
to evolve in the concepts trying to understand um 
to understand the quantity of these tiny particles and they reach to understand 
also how to measure the particles of light 
so the quantity the Quantum of light 
around 1800s what the people that started to discover 
this tiny little particles so in order to understand the tiniest particles okay 
the tiniest particles of all they could understand how to quantify the energy of 
things and that was the beginning of the thermodynamics okay so how to understand how the universe works 
the laws of thermodynamics so Quantum was used there to measure 
these amounts of energy so what this discovery is made was like 
the universe gives and receive energy in tiny little particles and packages of 
information and energy so this energy is shared give and received by this tiny 
package of energy that are quantity quantifiable so they quantify so so so 
you can quantify them so that's why they call them quantums this is where the Quantic theories 
starts to be born 
so now when we when the the human started to 
have much more tools to see inside of these tiny particles and go beyond this 
subatomical particles they figure out that the loss of 
thermodynamics doesn't work that the loss of thermodynamics goes from the particles above 
and the macro Cosmos but they don't work in the microcosmos 
under the subatomical structure 
the funny thing that happened when you go inside 
of this reality is that the tiniest particle of energy 
that you that we thought was the quantum the tiniest 
measurable thing in the universe the quantum 
suddenly can't behave like this like two particles or 
behave like waves 
so it doesn't matter it can do whatever 
so they can behave like physical particles or vibrational waves 
so another weird thing that happened down there or inside 
is that every particle can divide itself in thousands of particles or waves at 
the same time so creating thousands of other options possibilities 
parallel realities all the time but will only exist the one that we 
perceive the one that we put our attention on 
that is the one that will manifest but the others 
we don't know what happened with them so that's like 
so that's why we call it Quantic physics physics 
quantum physics because after you reached the last Quantum of 
energy or the last Quantum particle 
everything is impossible to understand so that's what that's why they call it 
the quantum physics the quantum mechanics 
so now to understand something basics the difference between 
the bigger physics and the smaller physics 
in the bigger physics 0 is equal a wave 
for example I'm giving an example zero is equal to wave and one is equal 
a particle 
hmm so it will always be 
a wave and a particle but in the quantum 
physics that I just said before the wave can behave as a particle and 
the particle can behave as a wave so 
it really doesn't matter because in the physic in the Quantic is all the 
same so now in the in the binary code of 0 1 
we can interpret that zero is one data is an information and one is another data so when you put these connections 
of one zero zero zero one one zero zero one one and infinite codes of one and zero one and 
zero they will always represent information encoded 
Okay so 0 1 0 1 this will be spaces and 
um and and places occupied places by data by the 
information so there are codes when you have a problem to solve the codes has 
all the information and so they try to match this information with the one that 
they have to solve the problem so it's basically that so 
um just to understand this is algebra I I don't understand anything about this mathematics and and algebra all that but 
uh just to have the basics in mind um zero one are just two codes of 
information so depending on how they organized they will be something shown something 
will be shown so for example what you see now in the screen the words the 
people writing and everything that when you write and appears on the screen all that are codes colors letters everything 
that you are seeing myself are all encoded in zero one one zero zero one one zero is constantly that is is it's 
just a constant of codes between zero and one all the time okay so 
um so that would be so now the the the really 
good thing about the quantics in this is that the zero and the one doesn't really 
means zero and one it means many things so it can be whatever all the time 
so many options are open with the quantum because zero is not zero zero 
can be zero one and everything so when you put the quantum mechanics 
into the normal mechanics 
it sold much faster the problems and look for much more answers 
than before it multiplies by thousands the possibilities of having information 
because in only one thing when the physics see only one thing the mechanic 
the quantics see many different things in many directions 
so that's why the quantum computers the quantum mechanics for the for today are 
being really useful to the EI for the 
new technology for all the Transformations that we are having constantly all the time 
foreign so now we have here two different things 
the quantum of the macrocosmic physics 
and the Quantum of the microcosmic physics 
the Quantum of the macrocosmic physics is the one that measures the 
quantity of things so the quantum the quantum Quantum of 
the macrocosmos is the one that refers to to the 
measurement of things the quantity of the things through space and Through Time 
the Quantum of the microcosmic physics 
is the one that that talks about the possibilities of things 
probabilities of things so we can say also that this 
quantifying things can be called also in this way 
Joe soy I am 
this connection between the micro and the macro has been always seen by the spirituality 
throughout thousands of years but science is trying to understand this 
now and today's spirituality we used to say 
a Quantum Leap what is 
a Quantum Leap what is a quantify 
leap now if we already got the idea 
that the how much de cuanto quantum 
is the measurement of something through time and space 
according to the space that it occupies in this reality 
and through the microcosmos the measurement of the quantum is 
according to 
the decision of being a particle or a wave 
so what is the leap 
remember this the word how much 
the quantum in the macro Cosmic in the microcosmic physics 
related to the mean the self is the one that measures 
the spice the space has space and time that something occupies 
in the reality that's the summary 
of this and remember this difference 
in the microcosmic physics the quantum the how much 
is describing how something can be transformed from a particle to 
a wave being free and eternal deciding whatever freely without any law 
those are the two visions of the quantum the of the quantum world 
so what is 
the Quantum Leap so the Quantum Leap would be 
when the object the being the subject becomes aware 
that even if it is living through a time and through a space 
it has also the inner will to transform itself and transcend itself 
freely from one shape to another 
through the eternity in a spiritual way 
a Quantum Leap is to become aware that we are God 
and from the point of view of science is to learn how to 
travel through time until transportation 
and many other things but I'm heading so 
um of course that there are many other things to say but we have time I don't 
have any plan to die any day around so we have 
time to speak about these things in another moments too so 
um so sorry because of all these things and information but it's just that I 
don't usually know these things and and use these things this information so 
I'm kind of headache because there are many topics that I don't really know 
um so so of course that um uh I've I'm the one that is that 
tries to explain the line between etymology the past the economy the 
particles and and interdimensional realities 
but I don't know specifically about this topic so if you want to know much more 
deep about these things please go to the things that to the people that knows 
about this specifically my capacity to explain this arrives until 
here um the migration for today is go 
the statement for today is I am the created vision 
uh just one last thing that I didn't explain and I want to say yes 
foreign so the thing that I wanted to explain to to say uh as the last thing 
um is that um for sure you have heard this concept that we are the creators of our own 
reality um and this is a connection between the 
spiritual world and the science of the quantum mechanics because 
uh in the in the physics they can explain now that one particle can behave 
as many as as a wave or whatever so it can divide in many different options so 
imagine that the particle is an object remember object 
and the physics that says is that the reality depends on the one that is 
observing that reality meaning that there are many possibilities of the 
creation in this particle but it will be only manifested the one that is observed 
so all the others that are not observed they are not manifested even though they 
exist but the one that is manifested is the one that we observe so here we have 
the particle being the object and the Observer being the subject remember we spoke about that 
these days um so in the spirituality we say we are 
the creators the creators of our of our own reality and for sure you have heard 
this sentence which connects with this concept of the particle and the subject observed in the particle 
so what I wanted to say is that when we hear this thing that we are the creators 
of our of our own reality is not the person that decides that Reality by 
looking at it is the I am 
I am is the whole being that determines that is the mind the essence 
so if we are not aligned with the I am we cannot change the reality 
because it's not the person the eyes of the person The Observer is the subject 
and the subject is the whole being the entire being 
this is why the Quantum Leap that the people are 
talking about is not from the ego from the personality 
that decides to change the reality is from the I am it's a leap of consciousness 
of realizing that we are a whole The Observer is the I am and we are one 
of those potentialities of the particle that is manifested 
remember this is only one particle that has thousands of billions of options and 
the Observer the I am is the one that allows to manifest one of these options 
so we here we are one of those options 
one of those manifestations 
this is why when we are connected to the IM we are able to transform the reality 
because the personality is one of those manifested options 
of the particle 
so um I I think that I said what I wanted to 
say um if you didn't get it just listen it once and again 
and I will try to explain it better in some other way some other moment okay 
um yeah okay 
vibration go the statement for today is I am the 
um created vision the code for today is Orion 
the guardian of the Galaxy's portal is this scary Giant 
the warrior that hunts in the force of creation from its Stars 
come the beings that have secondated the worlds equally by love and by force 
what makes us live in a dual conflict this constellation is the axis between 
the four Stellar directions and for that the belt of the Giant 
is the guide of all civilizations to find balance between worlds and 
dimensions close our eyes 
and concentrate in the breathing 
[Music] 
I become aware of the space I find myself in

do I work [Music] 
come on 
[Music] 
don't do [Music] 
[Music] 
[Music] I am the vision of the created 
I am the vision of the created I am the vision of the created 
I am I am 
I am 
[Music] 
I start to bring this Consciousness all through my body stretching yawning and each one at its 
own Time come back here and now 
thank you everybody for being here as always and see you tomorrow at the same time
