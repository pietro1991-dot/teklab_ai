hi everyone 
good morning 
good afternoon good evening everyone 
just to let you know for all the new 
ones 
um that when people comes we are working 
every day and many hours and all the 
time together and we some of us awake at 
3 A.M in the morning and then we are 
doing stuff until now that we finish the 
implementation at 9 30 at night so of 
course that you may understand that I 
want to make it short because of course 
I'm really tired and we are all we all 
are and 
um the reason why I usually speak more 
when I am alone is because I don't do 
anything and basically I am I am very 
relaxed during the day so 
um 
so that's why I talk and talk 
so 
um 
first of all let's well let's go to the 
topic for today related to 
what happened today in the pyramid 
the pyramid 
um today we went to Catherine and 
um 
and the gift we receive for everyone 
there as a message was related to the 
second Kingdom which is the kingdom of 
the Soul 
the topic for today is 
um filling or also sentiment as you may 
call it 
um 
and the gift that we received today to 
share with everyone 
um 
is um 
to be incense 
so like the frankincense that 
um one of the Kings gives as a gift but 
playing with the words saying incense 
like the second gift but to be incense 
to be fully present in the senses that 
what what it meant 
so today we have received the messages 
from two different Wings one from the 
darkness and the other one from the 
light and they were balancing the energy 
of the soul of the system that we were 
working with 
so the dark one was someone that 
explained very straight was to the point 
where we have to to learn from today and 
one of the main things that I want to 
share is that he said 
um that we have to remember that even 
the reality everything is based in light 
and love 
that's the essence of it the the things 
that are within the existence but the 
shapes the structures are created by the 
Distortion of that light so all the 
things that exist in the matter they are 
designed by the darkness and darkness 
not 
uh not thinking about 
um 
not thinking about something bad but 
um those who create to manifest and to 
transform the reality to be what what it 
is so 
the it says that the 
um 
everything that we see beautiful in this 
world the beauty of nature the beauty of 
this reality that we experienced was 
also created by the darkness so what uh 
what the dark one was trying to say is 
that in order to uh to awake our light 
what we have to do is to be responsible 
of our Darkness 
the one that we have created 
so um 
the message was 
um also related to 
um 
um to be aware that darkness is the one 
that is around the light 
and this means that 
um 
um 
uh this is basically that 
every one of us has like a seed of light 
like a seed of uh of energy that is 
positive which is the essence of the 
being so the essence is inside each one 
of us 
and because it's positive by polarity 
and by magnetism attracts the negative 
to it so all the things that are 
negative are creating like a crust 
around this seed and this cross is made 
with the low emotions with sadness with 
suffering with Hunger 
um with um rage and all this this dark 
side that we have that surrounds this 
positive positive aspect 
so what the dark the dark one set is if 
you are looking for the essence of your 
being what you have to do is to look for 
that darkness that you have inside 
because you will find that Essence 
behind it because the essence is 
positive so attract all the negative 
around to create a crust 
so 
um this is why to be responsible is to 
understand and to face that darkness 
that is around my light 
so 
this was all about responsibility 
because this means that in order to 
um 
in order to awake the potential that we 
have within the positive aspect of the 
essence we have to know how to use that 
Darkness because once that we find the 
essence we are able to change the system 
to change our our reality to 
to create 
you can call it don't worry 
it was an echo of mine 
um 
so so it can create 
um it can create 
um you can create your own reality about 
that uh from that Darkness so how can 
you create from that from the darkness 
well the darkness basically is the loss 
of the universe all the laws that 
structure the reality are made with are 
made by the darkness 
so all that 
um all that Darkness 
um is the one controlling us when we are 
unaware 
okay 
and when we become conscious when we 
become aware 
then we can transform that reality so we 
can handle the loss of the Universe 
um by consciousness 
the darkness usually we feel that is bad 
because the system of the darkness used 
us when we are not responsible if we are 
responsible and conscious about our own 
creation our own reality so Darkness 
cannot do anything but if we are if we 
are unaware so they just can use it can 
use us as they want okay 
if you ask what are the laws of the 
Universe I will say them but I'm not 
going to explain them because we are 
going to work with them during the month 
of Capricorn 
so the laws are mentalism 
uh correspondence vibration 
rhythm cause and effect 
polarity 
generation and I will add two more which 
is 
Matrix and purpose 
so what the dark one said 
is that 
all these laws are the structures that 
create the matter 
and the matter is basically the way in 
which the light is assimilated 
hmm 
so this means that we from the world of 
matter 
absorb and and understand the patterns 
of light through the structures of 
darkness which is matter 
so I hope that you remember when we have 
been talking about two weeks ago 
about the five ways in which the matter 
absorbs the data of the light which are 
the five senses 
hmm 
just 
taste 
hearing 
vision 
smell and touch 
so this five will be the vehicles 
through which the light will be 
assimilated in the shadows 
so these five are basically illusions 
that makes a translation of light 
towards our inner world 
these five generate the senses 
in the physical 
aspect 
so what the dark said is that if these 
are the five tools to understand the 
light if we are willing to download The 
Divine into the matter to live properly 
here what we have to do is to live fully 
present in our senses 
what he said or he described like the 
gift of incense 
hmm 
to be incense 
they call this a gift because 
from the point of view of Darkness 
this is their gift for us to be able 
from the Shadows to perceive Delight 
so 
the senses are just the tools to 
perceive the light 
but 
the census did not 
um 
they don't storage the information that 
they receive 
so how do we storage information through 
energy 
and that energy we call it emotional so 
the way in which the emotional level 
storage the information of the census is 
what we call by the feelings or the 
sentiments 
so first of all what is the difference 
between feeling 
or sentiment with emotion 
so an emotion is a reaction a chemical 
reaction of your body according to an 
energetical pulse that it's provoked by 
something in the outside so something 
happens outside that pushes an energy 
that makes react your body 
and the organs starts to create this um 
hormones that we perceive as 
um that we perceive as 
um as emotions 
so what is a sentiment or a Feeling 
it is the storaging of data from all the 
feelings that you receive through the 
senses 
so you have like a notebook of all that 
data 
to activate it just in case something 
similar happens 
so a feeling is something that you 
activate from within towards the outside 
so the difference would be that an 
emotion is something provoked by the 
outside towards the inside 
and it is just momentaneous it's for for 
a while 
and a sentiment or feeling is something 
that 
goes from within towards the outside and 
it's like a library so it holds the 
information for a long long time 
you know 
so an emotion can be 
something 
quick a reaction but a sentiment or a 
feeling they can be 
um 
they can be 
inherit from generation to generation 
because they get 
recorded in your cells 
so it can become also I believe 
the sentiment the feeling is like the 
book 
the registry the records of all the 
things that our senses have perceived 
so through sentiments through feelings 
is how we can understand how our bodies 
and our whole history of our tree of 
life have been receiving this 
information through the story 
hmm 
so this is why in order to be aware of 
all the of all the things that we have 
Within we have to start to live more 
aware and fully present in our body 
and open the books of our feelings to 
understand them 
so we could understand how we have been 
receiving the codes of light through 
the senses 
this is why the gift that we received 
today it was about to live fully present 
in our senses that's why they use this 
game of words 
um 
with the incense 
live in sense 
as I said I was about the 
straight to the point uh so if you want 
to know anymore 
go and read the blog 
so let's go to the alignment 
today we begin with a new vibration 
the vibration for today is 
VA which is like 
knowing that 
saying a b v 
the statement for today is I am the 
universal Legacy 
I'm getting old 
the code for today is the truncated 
icosahedron 
cutting the vertices of the icosahedron 
we find 12 new faces 
having this way a total of 32 
pay attention 32 
with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal 
faces having 90 edges and 60 vertices 
this configuration forms the figure of 
the planetary grid of consciousness 
like a soccer ball 
that reveals 
the directions of cosmic Consciousness 
equally an inner observation 
and a constant external one for this 
originates the pattern that incarnates 
the third eye chakra 
we focus in our breathing Always by the 
nose

foreign 
[Music] 
foreign 
[Music] 
I begin to press and carries the tip of 
my fingers 
feeling the nerves on the tip of it 
foreign 
[Music] 
to the songs around me 
the animals 
foreign 
[Music] 
touch the tip of my fingers 
I take a look into it 
and perceive 
that they are not my hands 
they are the hands 
[Music] 
of a hominid 
that can run with them 
all covered 
in hair 
with my back curved 
sitting under the tree 
[Music] 
I am the first 
[Music] 
of all Humanity 
I see myself 
as an orangutan 
chimpanzee 
walking with my four legs 
reaching the limits of the forest 
as you see the Savannah 
and its animals 
remember 
how you touch and grab the tree 
and just turned out in two feet 
back 
and watch 
others like you 
Seated on the floor 
and one of them 
extend its hands 
to give you a rock 
take a deep breath and feel the motion 
of running 
through the other animals in the 
savannah 
reaching for the next three in the 
horizon 
[Music] 
in front of you 
under the tree 
you will see 
another minute 
standing up straight 
and you will give him 
this rock 
take a deep breath 
and I recognize myself receiving the 
same Rock again 
so now I take the Rock 
and start to run to the mountains 
and to the other side 
until I see 
the coast 
the ocean 
and with the feet on Water I can see a 
human 
and I give him this rock 
foreign 
[Music] 
and I recognize myself 
[Music] 
as human taking the Rock 
jumping into the water 
and taking a boat to cross the sea 
to the other side 
there 
I can find another human 
waiting there to take this rock 
[Music] 
in the other side 
this time this human is all dressed up 
foreign 
[Music] 
myself again 
crossing a big desert 
until I find in the other side 
beautiful 
Valley 
there's a long river 
[Music] 
I approached 
to the river finding a village 
and I deliver this rock 
to an agriculture 
it's a farmer 
I bend 
to the ground 
and with the seats 
I saw 
this rock 
[Music] 
now this farmer smiled 
singing to this rock knowing 
that is sowing 
the pillar 
of all Humanity 
[Music] 
them 
[Music] 
take a deep breath 
I am 
the same farmer 
that's seated 
the basis of humanity 
I am the same hominid 
that brought the seed for this Humanity 
I am the universal Legacy 
I am 
the universal Legacy 
I am Universal Legacy 
foreign 
[Music] 
lives here and now Within Me 
we can see the history 
for it lives 
in my soul 
I see 
I see I see 
[Music] 
and I start 
to touch the tip of my fingers again 
realizing 
thank you 
about the Legacy that is my body 
[Music] 
I recognize 
that all my sentiments my feelings 
were born in this in this first emotion 
of standing still watching The Horizon 
outside the forest 
and take a deep breath 
and I start to touch and carries the 
body 
thinking 
that first 
human community 
telling it 
telling to it 
that it accomplished its mission 
that it reached 
until myself Here and Now 
all right 
and I come back here and now opening my 
eyes 
[Music] 
thank you 
thank you everybody for being there and 
This Is How We Begin our 
emotional week 
of legacy 
so see you tomorrow at the same time and 
remember that tomorrow early in the 
morning we would be connecting from the 
Great Pyramid 
towards every one of the main nodes of 
the planetary breed 
see you tomorrow bye
