good morning good evening good night I hope we are all doing the list very quiet
slow very fine
I know
maybe you have many um
you may have many questions
uh
many doubts
we are almost 4 000 people every day uh
so I hope uh to answer all of your questions as I as I am able um
try to um well try to do um to do all my best to explain uh through the explanations the videos
also by writing um I hope
each one is is being able to do the list to do the list with all
um with all these things
we are talking every day some people are asking
list
um I would recommend them to watch the previous videos okay remember
this list
this task uh
I am telling to you uh they are not like in school they are not homework remember
um uh we are not in school okay
don't take it like
this is stuff for your life
if you don't feel doing it in
moment don't do it just feel free it's just a tool for your life
whenever you feel it to do it you will do it just think about um
that if we are doing all
of um if we are doing all
um for the world
trying to be more aware
conscious
we have to recognize is
we have to be responsible with our part um
someday we will have to do
job
work to watch ourselves Within I would say to you I recommend to you
uh to write it down
to be honest with yourself
um it's easy or we may do
of saying I don't find any lie I I I've never lie in my life or I don't have any lie or I don't find any truth um
we are all built through lies
truth
we just have to think about it more more sincerely maybe they are not big lies or big big truth or whatever
this is something
sometimes we should picture
we should know
some of the tiniest lies or truth are bigger than the ones we expect to be big lies
the smaller ones maybe are hurting us even more than something
we believe is really big sometimes if if you need help with someone okay is if I need to ask to someone for advice or whatever is good
I would recommend to do it by yourself alone you have to think you have to think of yourself sometimes we may think
this is kind of uh stupid to write down stuff
it's really hard
when we exteriorize um exteriorize um uh some of the truth
we never wrote we could set ourselves free
we had no idea hmm we had no we we have no idea about
would be
that was my truth
is
uh doing
is observe oneself observe yourself is one of the most difficult things to do
is the most important thing to work for the consciousness
today we are in the heart chakra
from the point of view of the Mind uh in
week
is the mind the heart has no relation with uh love with emotion nothing from the point of view of the Mind the heart is related with the service
the thing is
I was I was working today with the the worship in English
I was trying to do something different
some some to live my mind
suddenly I just disconnect from my higher self
I'm just trying to wait for the complete information
uh myself um Matthias I can explain lineal
I go step by step
with my higher self I see the whole picture
I wait for him
I was just saying
um maybe some of you in
situation maybe you you you would say um are you sad are you are you bad are you tired you have to rest no no I'm fine I'm fine maybe it's the light I don't know
maybe makes me feel like
but um no no I'm feeling I don't feel nothing really I didn't feel like nothing
so if I would feel bad I would tell you
I have no problem with
the concept of today
we were being speaking um of was to download everything
we have spoken in these past days
according to
I wrote in the in the blog we have to understand
remember the beliefs are the things
I am expected I'm I'm expecting it to be like I I suppose they are like I suppose they should be okay that's a belief the qualities are the tools
I inherit from those beliefs from my um my qualities
I do is to build my truth
what is a truth is the fact
I assimilate from
that I was perceiving I believe is something
I expect for the things to be hmm
the difference between belief
truth is the truth
they believe is
that I expect for the things to be
the truth is
that I accept
it is like
I would like to clarify
once
again for example to make a difference between both of them a truth a truth is for example the sentence the pencil is red I believe is
the pencil will only paint red do you understand the difference
to understand the difference it's clear to say
the pencil is red okay
the pencil is red
I can see it I can see it I can touch it
sadly the beliefs would say I believe
this pencil only paint in red
it's not the truth
you can paint with red
you can do other colors with
you can do different colors from the red
is some something
we
to make the difference between
we accept as the truth
what we are waiting for it to be a truth hmm these are the tools for the belief the qualities are the tools for the beliefs
in my life the qualities
I have are going to be according my beliefs
the qualities will be according to my beliefs I will act in my life according to those beliefs
perceptions of my truth
remember
um most of the ability
we have are coming from our history I hope
is going better
the beliefs come come uh can come um as a heritage they can come from very um far in the history
remember
another great difference between beliefs
Truth is
the belief can be inherit we can bring
information from the past from the culture in inheriting
the truth is something
I recognize myself
I had received for myself
interpreted by myself
the qualities are the tools from the beliefs
I also inherit the qualities they are with me since I was born it's not something
I was creating through my life the qualities are those things
I have in my body in my genetics
we have in one side the qualities
the beliefs a way in
we can understand
is
here in the crown chakra the beliefs are the perceptions
here the qualities are the tools of those perceptions
this will be repeated
the throat chakra the truth will be the perception of the truth
here in the heart we will have the tools of
truth from the third eye to the crown is something
I can create myself
I can inherit mostly I inherit from everything
I see
that I receive if those are stuff
I can inherit from others these are the two
are those
um
are
in my present okay
this is related with my own truth
I recognize
absorb uh
here the heart the heart is the um the tool
I myself I'm doing
that I myself I am realizing in
present is not something
I inherit or
I have since I was born is something
I am deciding to do
so
and
from my point of view in
reality
I share my truth or either share my lies
I receive truth
I receive lies
it brings us
the tool we have to share
information is giving
receiving
from the heart the hands
the arms we reach the heart
if I give truth in Balance
truth is balance of vibration I will receive truth in the same direction
if I share a lie the Distortion of
vibration will be the same
I will I will receive live
this giving
receiving implies these two hands
goes to the heart
as I said if the qualities are the tools
I inherit related to my beliefs
what I have in my heart my given
receiving are according to the truth or the lie
I have Within
could be like
if I I'm by rating low or bad in distortion
I open myself with
distortion I will receive Distortion
lies
I would love we to be very sincere with
that sometimes we usually put ourselves in the victim size side
we used to say
I am totally open love
and all
I have receive is lies
bad things I am not speaking
about love or to be like
like open no
is not emotion
is mind we are in the Mind week
the heart is not love for the mind for the mind is a transmitter is something
exchange energy everything
I receive in my life will be according to the vibration of my heart one thing is believing
I am giving love
the other thing is
my heart is balanced on giving love we usually believe things
we don't usually do things
am I saying
we need to do in order to prove
we are in
balance in
vibration
the heart has two hands okay do
it says
we need to do things not only to believe things
I am giving love
I I'm believing
I believe
I am giving love
I believe
I am giving love
I only receive hate is
I am believing not
I'm giving okay
for much
we love all of us to say
I am living from the heart it's very um for sure we are not living from the heart
it's all mind
in order to really leave in from the heart
we have to do is to be very clear
to analyze
do we think
we think we think otherwise we will be always living through
we believe
we think
in
system is
we have to acknowledge our utility
our
do you say it in English to be useless okay two be useful
to be useless that's easy in English the way um the way we have to understand the way of tools
we have inside the tools
we have inside for our truth or our lies is
useful we are for others
how useless we are for others
I wrote something today about being useless
being useless is not something bad being useless is the key to the teamwork we wouldn't be able to work all together if I wouldn't be useless for some things
you wouldn't be useful for some other things you know from
the conflicts of useless the conflict we have with the word useless come from it comes from the moment of the Industrial Revolution
the Industrial Revolution humans were had been seen as tools for the factory
whether you are useful or whether you are useless
the Industrial Revolution the school was created in order to create tools for the factories for the work not people
this is
for a society
who has built for work the worst word
we could say to one of them is useless you are useless
from
is
from
we have the conflict with
word
we have to understand about the concept of useless is
recognizing myself as useless in some aspects helps me to realize
I am weak in some parts of myself
to
myself to ask for help to others
really is all a perception thing by knowing acknowledging myself
I am useful for some things
use less for some others helps me to know
I have tools
stuff to help others
doesn't have
I have
that I can allow myself to receive help help for some other people in the things
I don't have the reason
we fail as individuals is
since we are Childs we were taught
you can do everything you don't need anyone to do
you can do
they taught us
to compete
to fight with the others
I can do everything
we don't know
to work in community
we want to do everything just look
the key to heal
competitive civilization
we have it was just to recognize
to be useless in some stuff is it's not an insult is to recognize
I need help we have put a negative weight in
it means to be useless
useful I'm sure
everyone
has felt useless in your own life we are three thousand six hundred
twenty six people
and do you all feel useless if I dare myself to say I am useless for
for sure
will be like 15 15 100 people
that would say oh I know
to do it do you want me to help you
we usually say no I I can't say
I am useless I met the power is within me I can do it it's useless to say
because
um is to it's a loss of time it's a lose of time
now I'm going to say
in in something
we all maybe recognize it
for sure you have heard these politicians
say
they are going to be president
says I can do it I will change
I will do blah blah blah blah
can one only person solve the problems of 50 million it's impossible we have 50 000 people to solve problems
we all put our faith into one only person to solve the problems
is cultural we have created a culture through a basement of competition
I am not speaking about capitalism
and speaking about every system
I recognize freely
I can be useless
useful at the same time I can work with a team
it's good to say also
I can do whatever I want
Within Myself I have the potential of the whole universe everything is within me
I am limitless
we have a problem
that we ourselves are Limitless
our personality is not we are Limitless
our cells can transform itself in thousands of things we can die
transform
become anything we want through time
space
personality disappears I am completely uh Limitless
I am
in
tiny part of my experience I have only these tools
I'm limited
this is
I have to recognize
I need from the other infinite beings to make myself
then we can go to the essence of all
that suddenly I realized
I am everything
I am the whole thing
if I am everything
the other who I'm asking help to is another part of me
I am myself helping me in another shape
it's me look
much we have separated ourselves as humans
when we say I can do everything I think
it's my personality my my personality is just another tool of everything
I can do
I am everyone to say to myself I cannot with
is not just it's not surrender to life it's just to say I cannot do it I will look for another tool another one
can do it
then we call it team
recognizing
is
we can recognize
write down in
I am useless
why
in
I am useful
is a teamwork
the team is myself
with
we will calibrate the heart
today we we had a delay
of the um problems with the communication in the computer
