Hi everyone! Guen Morgan! Good evening! Good evening!

Sangamon! Yeah , Mac! Yeah , good! Yes , good!

So , you have it also in. . . .

. . At Lantenlangwitch. Someday ,.

. . When I am. .

. . . .

80-years-old ,. . . I will do a seminar of at Lantenlangwitch.

Haha! I 'm a say , I am feeling better. Um. .

. . . .

I guess I am. . . .

. . due in a very hard work with myself. Haha!

So. . . .

. . been more aligned with my body. So , today we begin with the throw chara in the physical way.

Weak , sorry , in the physical week. During the month of Scorpio. The topic for today is. .

. . . .

Hired. . . .

Hired. Related to the throw chara. And. .

. . . .

It 's weird that we say throw chara related to the ears and hearing. But. . .

. . . one of the.

. . . .

. I think that we should know. . .

. . . is that the throw chara is also called the third ear.

The third ear. And this is because , as we have two eyes and then one eye in the centre of the third eye , we also have two ears and a third one , which is. . .

. . . Hired , the third ear in the throat.

So , the reason why this is like that is because , in the same way as I have two eyes to see everything outside. And then I close my eyes and see everything within. I can see myself from within. So , the two ears capture all the information in sound from around.

And then this one here , the throat , is the one that express the sound. Express my own voice. So , it 's from where I am here myself here my own voice. So , the throw chara is related to listen to myself , myself.

So , as mammals , we have evolved in the sense of hearing. Because , to listen the different waves of sound , the higher waves , the lower waves of sound , it helps us to identify in our environment , what are the good things and what are the bad things. Good things , meaning the voice of mom and dad , for example , to interpret it to know where can I feel safe , or the sounds like for my enemies , the animals that maybe can kill me , or all those things. So , hearing helps me to move properly in my environment.

For each one of the species , the development of the evolution of every sense is related to the environment , where they move. So , for us humans , we have developed a lot , the hearing , because everything that we do is related to the sharing with words , talking culture. Everything that we do is related to the words. So , that 's why we had to be very prepared to perceive the sounds , the specific sounds , so we could communicate each other in a proper way.

So , as we said yesterday with the eyes , the hearing also have the same focusing with the conscience , then the unconscious , and then the subconscious surrounding us around. So , we have some things that we specifically hear , but then we have some other things that are around that we do n't pay much attention. And then we have the subconscious of hearing that are all that data information that we even think that they affect to us. For example , we usually say if we listen to something that I do n't care that I do n't mind , my conscious part will say , I do n't care.

This gets through one ear and get out through the other ear. But this is not like that. This is just the thought that you have in your conscience , but in your stop conscience , which is your body , your body does n't interpret it different information. So , for the body , it 's all information needed for something.

So , everything that you hear will be storage , somehow for anything just in case. So , this means that we have a lot of information from the outer world that condition our inner world. So , let 's speak about the different levels of consciousness related to hearing. An example for the conscious way is that for example , I have a problem and I go with someone and I ask that someone , I have this problem.

What is your advice for me to solve this problem? So , the other one will answer with that kind of solution with an advice. And I will capture that information because I was willing to listen because I action with my all awareness and consciousness and all my body is paying attention because my body wants to know. It wants to take each one of the codes of that information.

So , I am aware , I am conscious about it. So , let 's go with that example , but in a very much easier way to understand it. So , to make this specific example , imagine that you go into a party and you are dressed with blue. And suddenly you find someone , you find someone there , a friend , and you say , hey , you ask him , hey , do you like how blue suits me?

And your friend will say , for example , yes , I really like the blue and you. So , you suddenly say , for yourself , okay , perfect. Now you have the information , you have the data now , the information that your friend likes the blue. So , you now know that you can dress with blue all the time because you heard , oh , the blue is good in you.

Perfect , but you asked it. So , that would be the conscious aspect because I kept , I kept with the answer because I was looking for the answer , I made a question and I was looking specifically for what I wanted to hear. But then , for example , we go to the same party and before we go to our friend , there is someone coming through and says , hey , the blue is good on you and just leaves. So , what happened there?

That 's in unconscious and conscience message that I received in that moment. The unconscious message is that I was n't expecting the information , information just appeared , just came up. So , for me , for my consciousness , it was just words that suddenly they will disappear. But for my body , that information got stuck inside of me.

And suddenly , when I have to go to different parties , I will keep looking for the blue to wear because my body suddenly will show me , hey , the blue is better. Just because of that comment that I never pay attention to. And then we have the third one , the third option , which is the subconscious. The moment of the subconscious is when you go to the party and you do n't pay attention to anything that is happening , but in the environment , there are people saying , blue , oh , what a beautiful dress blue , oh , you see the blue or someone saying , I 'm feeling blue , I do n't know.

You just feel different words of blue that you are not paying attention to , but your body is listening to it. So , the next party you will dress blue , because your subconscious says blue , blue , blue , blue party , blue , blue , blue , blue , blue , blue , that would be the subconscious. Do you understand the difference between three ways? How you capture all that data?

So now you can understand that during all your life , through every year of your life , you have been absorbing from the environment thousands of informations that you receive from everywhere. Words , songs , music , everything , noises that you perceive constantly , but that you do n't care about it , because they are not in your point of view. You are not looking for that , but all that information is there , storing in your subconscious. And then you have the unconscious , which is all information that others want for you to know , but you are not asking for.

And even though it 's information that you now have with him. And the rest is the information of the conscious , which is the one that you asked for , that you know that you want to listen , which is a tiny aspect of your whole life. Now that we all are speaking usually about Reggina , for example , that nobody likes Reggina , but everyone listen Reggina. So now is the time to make critics to Reggina.

So I do n't know if it happens to you that when you listen into music and suddenly there is Reggina playing around. During the whole day , you just repeat constantly here in your brain. Reggina is constantly playing , and you may say , why not be valid? Why not back?

Why , Reggina? Okay , so that 's the subconscious working. So in another way , also how many people that we are not religious anymore , that we do n't believe in the Christian God or whatever , or agnostic people , or all those people , that even if we do n't have that tradition anymore , we do n't have that belief. We used to say , thank God , or if God made God bless you , why do we repeat that?

So the subconscious just take everything that is around , all the information that we listen , that we hear , and just use it just in case we need it. So here 's when we realize that in about the 80 % of all the information that we receive in our lives , we are the echoes of that data. We are not the creators of that data. We are just the echoes.

When we understand this , that we are echoes , we will also recognize that we in this body have been assigned to perceive the information from the outside. Everything that is in the outside is the most important for the body , because the body is trying to understand the environment where it moves. So this is why it 's receiving constantly and given much more importance to what it listens in the outside than in the inside. And this is why we pay attention a lot to what others have to say to us than what we have to say for ourselves.

Because that psychologically we put the truth outside , and we put the opinions that we give the power to the others outside. So this means that we are paying attention to everything that is happening outside , everything that someone has to say to us or for us. So through all these thousands of years where we have been assigned and used to listen to the others and to give the power to the others , suddenly in the last few decades , we stop willing to listen to the others. And we just started to talk louder than the others.

Because I do n't want to listen to the other ones , so I want just to have my power. So and here is where we do the great mistake. When we think that to set myself free from the words of the others , it 's not to start to listen myself , it 's to speak louder than the rest. So from that moment , since that moment , people listen not even listening to themselves , not listening to the others , only speaking louder than the others.

Not listening anyone , not even myself , not even yourself. We have arrived to a moment where everyone is shouting to each other , and the only thing that you can hear is noise. And our body was designed to listen harmony , because harmony brings us equilibrium balance. And when we have this on earth , it brings us malice.

In a society like ours today , where we believe that having the taking my power back is to shout our loud. Is that we are building a society where we forget that the power is to know how to listen. The ability of hearing is to know how to listen to the other one , not how to speak louder than the other one. And this is why today in our society there is no dialogue.

There are only arguments , discussions , discussions. Because in the moment , as we are today , believing that each one of us has its own truth , what we start to do is to not to pay attention to the truth of others. The gift of hearing is the ability to find balance. So the reason why is hearing the sense that helps you to find balance is biological , because within the ear , the inner ear , we have a liquid.

And this liquid is like a lake inside like a shell of a snail. And inside that , this liquid makes the level the leveling of my own world , which is the body. So if I turn like this , this liquid will not do this with me. This liquid will be all the time exactly the same.

Okay , looking for the balance , like a lake. So inside of it , there are many little connections with the brain that tells to the body where am I moving to? So this liquid is the one , if I am falling that way , the brain says , hey , the liquid of the ear told me to move this arm just in case I fall down into the floor. So this is why the ears are the ones helping me to find the balance to be imbalance.

So how can I translate it in the consciousness of all this? That every student that I hear are the ones that helps me to be biologically in the balance. So this means that everything that I am hearing listening by the subconscious will determine my emotional balance. See?

So everything that I listen from the physical world will bring balance in my physical body. And everything that I listen through each one of my conscience aspects will determine my emotional balance. So this is the reason why in our actual society , we are so ambulance emotionally. It 's because we are not being able to speak our truth , to talk with the other one , to listen and pay attention to the other one.

Which is shout out loud. This is why we are willing to find much more emotional balance. We have to make much more silence. We have to learn to respect the other one.

While the other one is talking. Even if we do n't agree with that person , we have to learn how to listen that person. We have to make every one of the noises that we hear outside , a sound that helps us to find the balance. So also is important to find the balance in those sounds.

So it 's good to practice meditation in places with noise. If I go in a public place and I start to mediate. I can hear , I do n't know , cars. So I just breathe in and take the sound of the cars and use it for the meditation.

I see people talking , I take that talk into the meditation. Use the noises as a way to find the balance. By listening. So this is why we have to learn to mediate with noise because in that way we are willing to understand better the silence.

So the important thing to know about today is that hearing , the sense of hearing is not just about listening things. It 's about emotion balance. So everything that you hear , listen in your life. It goes straight to your soul to your emotional balance.

So the way in which you can help to balance that is by paying much more attention to silence. Listen. Listen into the other one. And to speak with your power.

To be attention to your own voice , to what you say , to what you express. And the people that have lost the hearing , like , the people without hearing , they have to be attention to the vibration of the things. The vibration is the key. So let 's go to the information for today.

I just solved the time that is and I just realized that I think that I will speak less every day and I end up talking more every day. So , want to shut up. The vibration for today is , Chan. The statement for today is , I am the emptiness that neutralize.

The code for today is the unconscious experimentation. Just as a subconscious implies all the possible past that constitute me. This means I am the history in the unconscious aspect. I am the result of my surroundings , of my present.

What surrounds me , what I feel , listen , live and do in my everyday , what I see and perceive , modifies myself and makes me be an act based on that. With a more objective of surviving in that environment. Let 's go to the line. Take it as brand.

From my crown towards the feet , each part of my body. And I become aware of each part of the body. I am able to understand that I am here to work for this creature. I am the result of my surroundings , of my past.

I am the result of my surroundings , of my past. I am the result of my surroundings , of my past. I am the result of my surroundings , of my past. I am the result of my surroundings , of my past.

I am the result of my surroundings , of my past. Let 's start to walk by the forest. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker , like a rainforest. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.

I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. In front of me , I see the biggest tree of all with huge roots and branches. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.

I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.

I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.

I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.

I recognize the importance of this sound. I walk and walk into the void. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.

I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.

I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes less darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker. I walk and walk deeper until it becomes more darker.
