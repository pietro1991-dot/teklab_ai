hi everyone good morning 
good afternoon good evening 
welcome everybody so welcome to all of you 
to to the day of the heart 
in the wake of the Mind in the month of Aries 
so let's go to the topic for today which is the question 
which so which is the question 
the question is which so as you see 
I'm here in another place because there's a 
wedding again so 
we keep uniting We Are All One 
I was thinking just talking about this Easter and 
um Easter and here in the Arabic the Muslim 
countries we have um the Ramadan in this month in a few 
days um so I've been thinking that maybe 
we have to begin with the Quaresma which is starvation 
starvation is not it's fasting for 40 days which means that you cannot 
eat during the day you can eat after six um before 4am and after 6 00 pm 
so um it's a good way to make 
um fasting and this is an ancient tradition for all the Semitic people 
um for this month um 
so people doesn't eat to give the food also to to the poor people and to 
remember um the the hunger of the ones that led the 
freedom of their cultures so maybe I don't know I've been thinking 
of that um so all this thing of Easter of the 
Quaresma is something that comes from the quarantine so 40 days 
of fasting so for those who feel it 
um who ReSound with this I invite you for this month to 
um um to do it 
so um one of the traditions of why 
this um how do you say this fasting 
um in the Semitic Traditions was because um they 
um uh they were honoring the people that took a long path to reach the holy land 
and to that they were starving and 
and thirsty and so and somehow they honor 
those people that suffered that and of course helping the the ones that have 
less um so 
um so that's it um osaki 
um um so um just for you to know that this 
quarantines you are are used to do in the month of Aries because 
um is a time for the beginning so it's like a celebration for the beginning of 
a new year um so it's like honoring all the ones that 
that left um so that would be of course that 
taking this um idea of uh this month is the beginning 
of the year um that's why it's this days is called 
the resurrection is the resurrection because it's the beginning of the new time of a new cycle 
um so uh it's not related to Jesus again 
Jesus Christ the idea of Jesus Christ to the concept of the Resurrection in the 
month of Aries to um to show this celebration of the new 
year um so 
um so it's not about Christian it's about an old tradition of resurrection of the 
new time abundance of a new cycle um so I'm explaining this for those who 
are not Christians or doesn't believe in the things so you can know that this is 
not because of our religion tradition is because something natural of the 
cultures and the Stars 
um so and and remember that the reason why we eat rabbits 
chocolate I'm sorry chocolate eggs um is basically because of the hunger in 
Europe many years ago that all the things that they had to eat was 
chicken eggs and rabbits that were all around in Europe 
so um so that's why they were doing fasting 
and and they were um 
eating only that because of the protein um so that's the only thing they had 
um so the tradition of eating eggs and rabbits came in Europe for that and then 
of course the chromos pain took Belgium um during the 
um colonizations and they brought all the Cacao from the 
Americas to Brooks to brew 
and and that's why they started to do the chocolate eggs and so on 
so that's killing the magic sorry 
so for those who want to do this fasting this month I 
recommend it to start it I will start this week to share the food with others and to 
to start the the fasting so I won't say 
never how to do a fasting 
um because you have to do it according to your own body so I would recommend 
for you that if you want to do this you have to follow 
um to follow your own body to see what can you do and also to speak with some 
nutritionists or some doctor to tell you what is your best way of 
um of doing it okay so it's not good to 
do something that others do because maybe it's not the good way for you to 
do it just uh for you to know these kind of traditions are not really 
from the religious point of view actually it was 
um it was from um 
from the cultural wisdom the people's wisdom so 
um it was something natural that people used to do as a tradition for the population and then was taken as 
um was taken as you say as a religious tradition so 
um just for us to know that when we are doing these kind of things it's not because of a religion or cultural belief 
no it's just for the body is to heal the body to the good practice to to release 
the toxins and all these kind of things okay so it's my it's much more for health to help the 
synopsis The Connection of every cell in the body um than for spirituality okay of course 
that when you do this you have better connection with yourself within and outside so of course that helps in the 
spirituality but mainly is to be fully present here and now 
so let's go to the topic for today which is related to the heart chakra and the 
question is which 
so of course that we are also learning about English and 
Spanish here mainly by about questions 
um and also in the European language which we are not gonna use much but 
it's been really helpful 
so the question which 
the question which comes exactly from the same origin as Spanish that is 
object 
object and likan meaning form the shape of something 
so the question quality can means what is the shape of this object 
what is this object alike okay so the question was asking about 
the shape of things if they are equal equal is the origin of this 
is the origin of equal okay the the word equal so 
this means that what we what qualican is describing is the things that are 
similar to each other that are equal to each other and by the 
evolution of the word we started to use which as the election the choice in 
between two things that are similar so the question evolved into choose 
between two things that are similar to each other thank you 
Lincoln is the origin of the word like when you compare things like this like 
that is that origin it's the shape of something 
so now another thing the word qualican is the question of 
what is the shape of an object but the answer 
the shape of an object is this or that describes the quality of something 
and that's quality uh I don't remember how you how you 
spell um Quality in English I don't know if I didn't write or I did it wrong 
sorry qualities with Q yes 
sorry okay so 
um thank you so as you see quality and qualidad both 
has the same origin which is 
so when you take can you have you put tat which is the ability of something 
qualitative is Quality quality okay 
so which which gives us also the quality of things when we ask 
about something about how is something um the answer will describe the quality 
of things so the question the question which 
related to the heart is when we are asking about the qualities of something 
just a moment 
so now the question which is something that in our culture we 
relate to try to decide in between two things that 
are similar so we have two different things that are related that are kind of 
similar equal to each other and we kind of try to from the ego decide which one 
of them are better for us that's the point of view that we have of choice 
when we ask ourselves which one but from the point of view of the inner 
side which is the attribute of them of the self the question which is not 
speaking about which one I have to choose is speaking about which one has 
the quality that I need so I repeat 
when we ask from the ego from the ego saying which 
can I choose from the inside I will be asking asking which one has the quality 
that I need which is the question from the heart 
because from the heart we have two arms two hands one of them 
the left hand is the receiving and the 
right hand is giving it doesn't matter if you are um 
left-handed or right-handed doesn't matter is the same because this one is 
closest to the heart so we'll receive information from here 
so I received here and I give from here from the right hand 
so um so when I ask which 
should I choose uh it's exactly related to the amount of 
vibration that I have within me which means that if I I'm willing to receive a 
pen I have to ReSound and give a pen in 
order to receive this one so I have to give the same amount of energy that I 
receive in order to to be able to to be in the same quality 
to understand the quality of things um to understand the quality of things 
we have to remember how the Law of Attraction works the law of attraction 
is not that you wish to have something and you put all your energy into 
receiving that something The Law of Attraction works much more like a radio station 
so in order to for you to receive something that is in a wave in a in a 
wave of frequency uh like like the program of the radio it's it's an in 
specific hurts um in order to receive that information you need to tune yourself 
to that level okay so it's not that you just wish for it and you have it that's 
not Law of Attraction the law of attraction is you tuning yourself to be in the same quality of the 
vibration of the vibration that you are willing to 
receive so you have to give kind of the same energy in order to receive the 
energy that you are willing to receive so this means that in order to activate the quality you have to act according 
that quality okay 
so this is why when we ask ourselves which from the ego which 
one should I choose from the ego you pick one of them but from the inside your inner self is 
choosing is picking the things according to your quality your quality of 
vibration so it doesn't matter which one you choose from your mind and through 
your um through your ego uh the the things that 
you are gonna have in your life are according to the quality of your vibration 
so this is why we have to know how to question which 
because it's not about which one should I choose 
from the ego willing to have one of them but which one has the quality 
that I need for myself so now let's think about the heart like 
a magnet the heart is like this magnet that is looking for 
the energy that we don't have for example 
imagine that you your heart is in negative so it needs a quality that you 
don't have and you are looking for that quality so the magnet the negative will 
start to expand to look outside into the positive in order to match that quality 
and Achieve that energy that you don't have to have the experience of that quality 
that you are not willing you are not achieving okay so your heart starts to 
go out and look for that information and that's what we call 
falling in love falling in love of the qualities that you are looking for 
we usually fall in love of the people that have something 
that we don't have that we admire from the other person that we 
love that the other person have 
and we would love to experience that we fall in love or we love the people 
that usually gives us experiences and things 
that by ourselves alone we couldn't never experience 
or feel or do and this is a good attribute of nature 
because by connecting myself with someone that 
has something that I don't have that's what we that's what we call evolution 
so as you see the reason why we exist why trees exist why animals exist is 
because everyone in nature are looking for someone that is original different 
that have something that can gives us something transcendental something new 
and that's why we evolve that's why we exist because of this Exchange 
for example when we try to to keep the same things not looking for something 
different what we start to do is is to reproduce in between the same group of 
families the or to keep the blood the blue line and so these things so they 
start to have diseases in the blood in them in the genetics and 
people start to to be unable to reproduce so the same 
nature is trying to kill them so this means that 
nature is pushing us to fall in love with those people and 
beings that have things that we don't have that are different from us that has 
something different to give in order to transform and to evolve 
this explains the importance of diversity 
so from this point of view giving and receiving 
are the ones that activate the quality of a being 
so now the way in which the people can 
um download this information 
this attribute from the other is by doing the same as the other 
when you fall in love with others when you love others for sure Naturally you 
will see that you start to imitate the other's Behavior 
you start to be like others you start to imitate 
the attitudes of the others depending on which people you are with 
in that moment so this is not something from the human point of view this is 
something that plants animals and humans does we do that by Nature it's not something 
cultural it's nature does this why because by acting like the other we are 
downloading the attributes of the others in ourselves 
that's why we start to live like the others we start to do the same things like the other to listen the same music 
like the others imitate the other 
we start to understand how to download information 
so now here is when hypocrisy comes 
hypocrisy is the moment when you download that information in 
you but instead of keep going with what you are 
with the being that you are and putting 
much more information in You by downloading this attribute of the others 
you just forget who you are in order to be like the other 
so you just live away who you wear in order to be 
the other to be accepted that hypocrisy 
so when this same system is for evolution 
when you start to download the information of the others not living Who You Are 
when I keep being myself but I add much more 
data from others sharing with others learning from others and putting much 
more information from others Within Me 
so now the question which is not about to deciding in between one 
thing or the other the question which is the one that shows me the path towards 
the quality that I need to download in myself 
it seems an easy question but look 
all the things that have behind 
okay okay the vibration for today is ghee 
the statement for today is I am the heart's vision the goal for today is purchase 
these Stars tell the story of Poseidon's son that departs for an for a danger to 
eliminate Medusa this means to the world of ideas and 
thoughts the patterns of the leaves that that stall us in our reality 
for that its strength reminds us to break boundaries move forward without fear 
face the beliefs and transcend what we believe of ourselves
