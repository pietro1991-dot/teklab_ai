hi everyone good morning good evening good night 
so today um We Gather to work with the root chakra 
and of course the root chakra is one of the most dense chakras that we have 
today I wrote um and share a little bit about information of the root chakra in 
emotional week which is related to the fear 
before we start with the alignment I um I wanted to 
to clarify some things so we are all on the same page 
the reason why this Checker is one of the most dense is because 
with the past of centuries and Millennials uh millenniums 
um we have um blocked and the energy was tucked 
there and the reason why we block this is because with the Earth 
so with our animal part so we have to be very clear about this 
animals think on eating and reproduce 
so is the animal part of ourselves because it's the one that connects us with the Earth with nature with 
evolution in evolution what every one of us is 
looking is to survive so we have two ways of survival 
eating and reproducing ourselves so at the moment when the humans start 
to create the culture and civilization and we started to think that we can come 
from the heavens that we should go to the heavens with the divine 
in the clouds in the Sun we started to go there and separate 
ourselves from the Earth and what we have done with this was to 
separate ourselves from the Animal Kingdom and we went to the heavens 
so this took ourselves to think that everything that is from the belly down 
is related to the animal part of ourselves so what we have done was to eliminate 
this part to to ban to talk about this part and just 
from the heart up and some of us we still do exactly the same even in 
spirituality not going away from religion but we still speak about 
from the heart up but we are not touching down there 
what happens with this is that through the time these start to this chakra starts to be 
blocked so this chakra has the potential too 
eat to have the energy and to to produce energy and to reproduce 
so everything that was related to survival so this created two ideas in our 
spiritual world to say that in order to reach the 
heavens we need to leave the Earth we need to leave the material world 
and in the other side that we should not have something related anything related 
with sex so both of them these two energies these 
two tools are related in just one idea in just one tool which is survival 
and survival has only one emotion 
which is fear fear was the fundamental tool for 
survival and also of course is the main based 
that has created what we are today so we have to honor a lot the fear it 
made us be what we are today why do we want to eat because we are 
afraid to die why do we want to have relationships because we want to feel 
ourselves part of something why our bodies 
needs to have sex because it looks for Transcendence 
talking just about biology then we go to the other aspect 
these two are just survival okay it's just for the body 
once we get inside a culture food and sex 
stop being just for survival and they become uh pleasure 
a goal of pleasure so when I become aware of myself with 
Consciousness the food becomes the knowledge the wisdom 
and the sex becomes the Kundalini the movement of the energy the enlightenment 
these three levels the animal one that looks for survival the cultural one that 
looks for pleasure and the spiritual one that looks for enlightenment 
the three of them are related with this chakra 
but the main emotion the trunk of this tree of of of 
structure is fear we have the fear of the subconscious 
this the fear in the subconscious is in the animal part because we don't have to think 
about it it just come up then we have the fear in the unconscious 
which is in the social or cultural aspect of ourselves 
and this part is the one that is unconscious because it's a fear that is pushed by the the 
environment by the society by the culture and then we have the fear in the 
conscience which is the one related to the sick of 
Enlightenment and wisdom so we could say maybe that the first 
fear the base fear is to die 
of hunger the next one is to fear to be alone 
to be expelled by others and the 
the last one is to not not exist 
that nothing exists these are the 
the main fears the basis of this fear 
so this Y is related to the basement with our basis basis 
so from these three fears we create many and thousands of 
different fears but each one of them are tools that helps us to survive and to go 
through this statements these stages sorry 
each one of our fears are building us 
towards the path of the consciousness 
one of the main reasons why we have so many fears is because 
we blocked so much that chakra that we never faced 
those fears so one of the things that we have to do 
is to unite ourselves with that fear and to use it in our own benefit 
to do that is to recognize in our biggest weakness 
our biggest strength so the first thing that we have to do is 
to recognize that fear to face that fear so after 
we recognize that we have to locate that fear in which one of those three levels 
we find it so in this way I will be able to recognize if my fear 
is related to myself to the projection of the other ones or my 
biology my body so when I recognize that fear what I do 
is to recognize that because of that fear I am here alive because fear has this goal to 
keep you alive so from that is when I start to 
understand the logic of that fear when I recognize that fear 
I can realize that I can look for new tools just a tiny example to understand how to 
um I won't talk about every fear because 
won't be possible so I will just take one to show you the process 
so when you go to for example you are afraid of uh of 
Darkness and you are afraid of Darkness so you go deep into why you have you have that 
fear Until you realize maybe that is in the first stage when you were animal when you in the darkness other animals 
could eat you so you had nothing to make light to see in 
the in the night but today you have a light a linger 
so you say okay I have a lean term so you 
touch an intern you you grab a light and with that you talk to the you talk 
to the theater and you say to the fear thank you for taking care of me until 
this moment but I found another another tool because I know that fear is protecting 
me in the Darkness but now I have another tool I have a lintern a light 
so you teach you teach 
your fear hey I don't need you now I have another tool 
don't ask me about your own fears you have the answer within 
you just have to go close your eyes face the fear ask yourself meditate why why I 
have this fear and go deep into that for sure will be difficult to face the 
fears and it will take a lot of time sometimes but it's your own process 
you need to do it by yourself 
one of the main things that we have to understand is that fear is not an enemy 
it's a friend that is trying to help you to survive so when you face that when you realize 
that you can transform that change the consciousness of that 
everything that we fear is related to our genitals 
so if you want to know more about uh about this relation between fear and the 
genitals just hashtag Sigmund Freud just 
look and read okay he knows much more than me about that 
they they were just asking about the justice and I want to make just a summary a brief summary of Justice we 
have a perspective of Justice that is divided uh in the concepts of uh 
punishment and price I would say yeah price and Punishment 
uh punishment and reward this creates a Justice that is very 
related to the hierarchy that that is natural too because it's 
something that came from from the nature so so it's it's it was good and it's at its moment 
the Justice must change according to our perception of consciousness 
Justice is not judge just did justice justice cannot uh 
punish should teach today I I talk about that Justice comes 
from the word uh make an adjust a judgment a judgment 
so to being someone just being someone with judgment is to 
adjust myself in line okay so the Justice today is very 
retrograde because it just talk about someone that is bad and someone that is 
good so what we have to do is not to find the Judgment of the self of the being but to 
find the balance the attachment the um yeah attach the adjustment of the 
beam so this adjustment 
is the goal of the right Justice 
well we have to understand is that this person is not bad or good is someone 
that is unbalanced that is not adjusted 
this is why I am recommending that before we make some judgment 
to something that we believe is good or bad we have to first 
make our own adjustment in ourselves 
so remember we are in the day of root chakra in the week in the emotional week 
and this is the month of Leo so this is the month of the icon 
so the variation of the day is whole ho means H the life and O is the sound 
of the production the product the fruit of everything that we do 
so the statement is I am life in production 
so this means that um that I am able to produce my own 
reality to create my own reality and the energy to produce that comes from the 
root chakra which is in my genitals so the code or information of today is 
again the sound ha but at this time is related not with just the breathing in 
but holding the energy remember that we have three moments of the breath which 
is breathe in whole breathing out and the three of them are h 
so it says then the spirit sights again and understands that everything that 
vibrates has to shine too the second H is head 
contemplation a process that originates from feeling relating to others allowing 
oneself to be pierced by all and penetrate all at the same time 
who irradiates in all directions of time manifesting in all spaces the moment 
when the soul cites so this is the information of today 
so [Music] um we are going to put the music and to 
start with the alignment 
as always we start sitting comfortable carries in our bodies 
[Music] remember that we carries and massage the body 
to let to let it know that we are going to work with the energy and also 
to honor it for being the anchor of the spirit day after day 
[Music] foreign 
relax my body I lift the weight 
[Music] 
become aware of my breathing foreign 
[Music] 
take a deep breath and go with the oxygen to your lungs 
heart blood 
organs muscles 
imagine the trip of your oxygen through your body 
[Music] 
I start to become aware with my breathing 
of the Heat that comes out from my body 
I start to expand the Heat filling up all my aura 
and allow myself to see the color around me 
[Music] 
this is the color the energy and emotion that today represents my energy 
I allow myself to think freely about all the things 
that I have done today on the emotions related to them 
I receive each one of them without judgment 
[Music] 
foreign [Music] 
with my hands say take all this energy color and emotions without judgment 
I bring them all around my genitals around my hip 
I shape this energy like you will 
a circle around the root chakra 
take a deep breath foreign 
that inside this chakra to have all the energy that give me 
strength power that helps me to produce 
to create and I recognize also 
that all these forces are hold by fears 
remember fear is not my enemy 
is just trying to help me with the tools 
that it have 
that it only has 
these two forces the positive and the negative are the ones that linked me 
with Mother Earth with my siblings the animals 
I recognize that this is the place where every one of my emotions find the 
strength the power toe up to seek for enlightenment 
foreign 
into this place so it helped so it could can help my 
emotions to find a way towards enlightenment 
foreign 
my vibration and makes pin faster and faster 
the will of my emotions around this chakra 
[Music] 
oh oh 
[Music] 
[Music] 
I keep pronouncing it once and again I feel the energy of the wheel 
being absorbed faster and faster by the chakra 
[Music] 
remember 
that this sound is the energy needed 
to to arrange to start the engine 
of my job of my root chakra 
[Music] 
oh [Music] 
I see the light Shining from my chakra 
going out through all my blocks 
breathe in and contemplate in front of you 
your biggest fear 
foreign to you you are just observing it 
breathe in 
[Music] while observing your fear 
[Music] straight to the ties 
[Music] feel the root chakra 
Shining brighter and brighter 
and I understand the consciousness of the I am 
I can't integrate my fear 
I can't transcend my fear 
I can use my fear to create 
I can't be free from Fear 
I can't be free from all my repression 
I can for I have the power 
[Music] 
I feel and see the light of my chakra 
foreign [Music] 
surrounding it and expanding its light towards every Horizon 
I observe perceive the big network of all these people 
facing and anchoring it's fear 
its power 
observe that fear to become a rock [Music] 
as brighter your light the rock is stronger 
recognize so that your fear has become 
a point of support 
I allow myself to feel to perceive all these rocks 
through all the network with this beautiful red light 
shining over them [Music] 
I recognize over this Stone 
I shall build my temple 
for I am to life in production 
I am to life in production I am life in production 
but I take my hands to my heart 
you know take a deep breath [Music] 
I can't transcend the fear 
[Music] 
for my fear is The Rock 
where I lay [Music] that supports me 
is The Rock over I am building 
for I am life in production 
[Music] 
I started to expand this truth from my heart towards every part of my body caressing 
massaging stretching and yawning and I open my eyes Softly 
[Music] 
[Music] 
we are back here and now 
foreign remember that it's normal to feel tired 
to sleep during the meditation is normal because we are just beginning with this 
so your body needs to process

feel bad or or something just lay down a moment in the floor rest
