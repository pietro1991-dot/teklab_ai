hi everyone good morning good evening good night wherever you are
um today we are meeting to work with the knees
information
is in the knees
um of course
information of today maybe it hits us in the stomach
it is related with the guilt even if we are able to feel the guilt in any part of our body mostly the center
the guilt is concentrated an anchor is in the knees
i will explain
the relationship between the knees
the guilty is
the knees represent the path represents everything
we have done
of course
we talk about being feeling guilty is
um we have done something wrong for example
in our history in our path all the mistakes are encoded in the knees
this is related not only by feeling guilty
also by pointing someone to be guilty
as i wrote today in the blog the guilty is related to the unconsciousness to be unconscious or to ignore some facts some information
must help us to understand
maybe we feel ourselves guilty the reason
we relate the guilt with the past is
when we think about the bad things
we did we usually take a look backwards in our history
we see the things
we have done
some somehow we say i would uh from
i wouldn't do it
way i would have done it in a different way
now i have tools to do it differently one of the things to understand
we see backwards is precisely
that our position from the present makes mesa makes us look
in the past we didn't have the tools to solve the problem or to answer in a proper way
what we are doing is realizing
in
moment i had no idea
to do the stuff
i was ignorant
it's not bad to be ignorant
we all are ignorant in some way
to be to ignore something it means
you don't know something we are all learning
is
what
we have to do
is to learn
the key of
we don't know the way in
we can do our stuff in our in our path is
we are learning the process is to make mistakes
while we do mistakes we learn
it's the common process to ignore some stuff
we try to look the process of feeling guilt feeling guilty or believing
someone is guilty it could be transformed just by understanding
that person is not aware
i myself i am not aware yet
what i have to do is to recognize
i am in the path to become aware conscious about stuff
also the other person
i believe is guilty is a person
had no idea about
to be aware or become conscious about the fact
changed the concept of guilty as we may believe it
we for example we can we can ask
um
kind of guilty is also for those uh persons
we believe they are doing
on purpose like some bad people
does horrible things on purpose yes even them
um
we have to acknowledge is
nobody does nothing bad being conscious about it everyone does
stuff being unconscious
reacting by the environment
themselves it's not about being aware or conscious
you are doing a bad thing if you are doing a bad thing is
you are not conscious
the reason
this is absurd for the spiritual mind is
from the spiritual levels the only thing
exists is the learning the process of learning from
point of view of the spirit someone
makes a mistake we call guilty is not someone
must be judged is someone
hadn't learned yet properly
we need to teach them properly to educate
person it's not about to forgive all these people
are doing bad things
we believe they are guilty for
is to be compassion with those people one of the ways in
we can understand
for the spiritual world the guilt doesn't exist is if you take yourself watching the humans like if we have two humans
this human
human is really bad really bad person
we in the same stage we say
is a really bad person
we start to fight
what we have to picture is ourselves being kids in the kit in the garden
when you are in the kindergarten for sure you had an enemy
tiny little boy
for sure was grabbing your hair or or throwing uh sound into your face your eyes whatever it was your enemy
from the point of view of your teachers
parents
is another level of consciousness it was just a child
had no idea
to make a relationship
kid need to learn
to handle
information
to handle their relationships with others
now come back again to the picture
you are two humans fighting
you feel
this one is your enemy
it's like a really bad person
from the point of view of the masters in another level it's just two kids fighting
none of them know really
to act properly
they are in the process of learning
this is
when we think about the spiritual level they don't see guilt people they don't see enemies
bad people they see all kids trying to learn
some people were asking about
even hitler we used to see the result of hitler
we have to go back to the past
see
he was a kid
was trying to be an artist he was painting he was trying to act in a in
to say in theater
nobody trusted him
everyone was trying to make him like the worst like you're not good for
you're not good for
you cannot do
you have to do another things
here was um
to say
word um frustrated a frustrated artist
suddenly he became a distortion of himself
i remember yours i remember something
i said to you in a few weeks a few weeks ago
every time
you see a bad person in history or right
you just have to picture
they were kids really hurt always kids really hurt one of the things
we um have to understand about compassion
i said
before is
compassion means to understand
process all these kids
has been have been hurt inside
when you picture
bad people you just see the kid hurting inside
compassion is to understand
that person was just trying to do
that person could understand about reality
you do
you start to set free the character
you start to heal otherwise you point your finger like saying no
person is guilty
you just keep rolling
rolling the same karma once
again one of the main things
we have to do
we become aware is stop thinking about the bad people in the past
to blame them
start to go
look into the new kids
think we have to do the best of ourselves
we don't project
guilty to them
they can be free
they can
we cannot repeat the same story one of the ways in
we can heal
process through the future is stop teaching the kids
they are good people
bad people
that the bad people must be judged
the good people must be priced one of the things
um uh
we have to um see in education for the future
how to heal
process is not to shutting up about anything from the past it's not too not to hide the history from all the things
from all the things
were wrong
we want to picture a good future for the kids
we only have to picture the beautiful things from the future no
we have to do is to show them everything
happened from very little everything
happened all the bad people
were in the past everything
happened
how a lot of suffering has been in the planet
and speak don't shut up anything all the problems everything you have to share with the kids
so through
you can teach them those people
did a really bad history were also kids like you one day
they were
hurt
they had no friends their parents didn't love them
they end up doing these things
they don't have the correct friends
taught them
to be loved
so on
this is
you start to change the perception not hiding history
give them to the kids give to the kids a new perspective of
to heal the guilty of
to heal the history through the future is a way in
we can try to stop
because otherwise if we just picture a beautiful future for the kids
we don't tell them the truth
how they can solve their own problems since they are friends
they are childs as i said in spanish i'm sorry for the word
we are going to screw it up again
like in hoponopono like sorry i love you
so on
um
are some ways in
you can start to to process
i know
is very difficult
enlightenment consciousness it doesn't come with with fear with it doesn't come with
um
do you say renko in in english i don't know the word resentment okay resentment um you will not get get aware
light
lighted by just thinking
they are bad people the reason
it's
difficult is
when you have lived very hard stuff like being raped abused killings the other person the one we believe is guilty they don't have the guilt they don't have the pain they don't have the the rancor grunge you say um uh they don't have
emotion we do you do
if you are trying to enlighten yourself
to go into another level of consciousness you have to transform
feeling
that emotion
this is
is a hard step
it's just for you it's just
do you say it's just for your own releasement it's just for your for your own freedom i know it's one of the worst things to do
in order to set us free is is a clue i i just want to remember you the sentence
jesus said on the cross forgive them
they don't know
they do
they do
they are doing
that's kind of the message
i was reading um a comment
that said
to forgive maybe it's easy
uh to forget it's not uh forget in in spanish language forget means um uh comes from from a from the ancient language
means to sleep slippery
something is slippery uh
means to fell down again okay
for english it would be forget is like holding again as you forgive is giving
away forget uh is to hold it okay
what we have to do
we have to do is to not not to forget we don't have to forget
we have to do is to face the problem to acknowledge the problem
to go over the problem to see the things from a different perspective
not to forget
if you forget you will go down again to the same thing okay
what we have to do is to remember
without any grunge grab right uh i don't need a word sorry um rancor you can say
too one of the things
i wanted to to answer for the last things is
do i transform the pain into compassion to
question
was
do i turn pain into compassion i must say
pain is a joint of all the energies
emotions
has been stuck in a part of my body
by being stuck in
in my body they are not moving
there's no transformation
what i have to do is a long process to understand to face the conflict to face the problem the emotions
to put myself in another position to watch it from another perspective
to make a new meaning give a new meaning to
happened to give a purpose to
happened okay
happened i cannot change it
what i have to do is to give a purpose to
so in order to give a purpose to
what i have to do is to um
i will do is to start moving
energy
it's a long process it's not just for two days
compassion is not something
you practice compassion is something
you just feel
just happens through the process of understanding of becoming aware of
the things happen
for sure
is many things in the past
is very difficult to to forgive
we were the victims from the point of view of victims we see
it's very difficult to forgive the other one
to release them from the guilt if i am in the position of the victim in order to go out from my role of the victim i must recognize my inner strength
it's like
how i can go into another level of consciousness these are the most heavy
difficult process
it breaks with every ethics
moral i i know
there are a lot of people saying examples like
this person
this person yes even them everyone i i told
before
everyone everyone
distortion persons
when they were kid they had a really bad life one of the uh main things
we have to do in order to create a new civilization is to release ourselves from the idea
there is bad people
good people
there are people distorted
people
is kind of aligned
in order to work for the consciousness we need to take another point of view
this is the most difficult
all of us happen for go through
kind of situations myself i cannot accept some stuff
i am working with them
i always try to remember
these persons have been through a very hard childhood we could be speaking about
for hours of course
we are going to the alignment the vibration we are going to work with today is su the of the statement we are going to use today is i am the path of my ancestors
the code information for today is the note resharp or me flat i guess no uh the mod i don't know the name um it is the chromatic vibrational bridge between the notes re
me in the alphabetic notations is named d sharp or e flat the mole i don't know the name the bridge between the earth vibration
the tree's potential is in its roots in the strength
in the nutrients absorption for
reason the note
note resonates in the root chakra okay
let's go to sue as always we start to massage our body
to sit properly as we prepare wow we stretch the body we yawn remember
as i touch the body i thanks to it for being the anchor of the spirit in the matter
i focus in my breathing i relax the body with each deep breathing i relax the body even more as i breathe deep i bring all
information
oxygen to my lungs heart blood organs
muscles
i take a moment to feel the hot all the heat inside my body i feel it going outside through my skin filling up the aura
all my magnetical field
so a picture outside of me the emotional level of the soul irradiating over me the fresh light like the moon
in the other side the warm light of the spiritual mind like if it is the sun shining on my skin i recognize my body as a temple the temple
my spirit
my soul inhabits i use my hands to touch
carries my legs the upper part the lower part
mostly the knees from the part behind
the one in front try to feel
recognize each corner of it i recognize
inside of them i can find all the pain not only from my history

in my knees i picture in front of me all these situations
push me back to the past all the situations
are not allowing me to move forward i picture them i picture every situation
