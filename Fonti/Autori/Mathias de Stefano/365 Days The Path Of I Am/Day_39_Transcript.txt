hi everyone good morning good evening good night
i hope
finds you well
let's work today with
chakra of the mind
we close the whole pattern
i've been reading uh some some comments in the social media in the different social media
a lot of people were saying i cannot understand
or is too much or um they get kind of frustrated
they are not able to catch up everything daily
um i know
this has been too much
i am writing too much
it's a hard work
we are doing every day
remember it's not something
you must do as updated okay some of the things
um
we are doing
we are processing
uh maybe for some people it takes a long time to to integrate um
um don't worry about it maybe some of you
would say i don't get it i can't understand
uh give me more examples
today maybe next year maybe in five years you will read
again
just say oh
i get it
i understand it
you needed some other process to get it okay
uh don't worry don't worry the information is
is in is online is in the blog
you can have it whatever you want the reason
we are doing
um every day is
we are uh trying to to make like a wave of information a continuous of information
this is like a like a wave
all the the people can can come
receive um these emotions
energy the information uh
some of some of us can make it daily
doing it daily it doesn't mean
you understand everything it doesn't mean
you can get the 100 of all information every day
means
you are trying
you are working with it
it doesn't matter if you understand or not the
matters is to set the willing the intention to do it
um there's also something
um we are moving
like an ocean with waves like a storm inside
with
movement we will be feeling things
we usually don't don't feel um
this is normal
we are moving stuff
we're stuck inside of us
allow yourself to feel it
also let's remember
we are going through the process of mars retrograde
i don't know
it's going to end i didn't check it
but uh it usually makes us be very mad
remember
um through everything
we have spoken in all the times these days we have to already acknowledge
we are moving all
information in our ways okay
we cannot blame anyone outside
whatever we feel inside is only ours
this is
whatever we feel inside we are the only ones able to calibrate calibrated
the most important thing
we calibrate anything is to understand
are we calibrating uh
we cannot uh keep going with all the work in the month without all the explanation of
this all works okay
this is
we are trying to understand all the the details
today the issue we are going to discuss today is the ankles
it's in the feet today our um the information of today is related to the feet
what is the information of the feet
as you first know is
we are um the feet are the ones
made us be
still in earth okay straight
and also they are the ones
with ankles they're the ones helping us to turn the feet to choose our path okay
this is
our feet moving like
can show us
where we go the next steps
we are taking
the concept of being grounded
on earth
the decision to
to go okay are both the concepts related to defeat the concept
we are going to discuss today is about destiny
we are all trying to get into our destiny we are all going through our destiny the main thing
we have to discuss is if
is the destiny
is
really a destiny in order to get into
destiny is uh we have to understand
we have spoken yesterday
i don't remember precisely everything
um the waves of history okay in the knees the knees are the history
the waves create the past present
the future
let's picture
we have spoken
everything the history is like the wave is like a wave of vibration
vibration is a big thing
holds all the process of trade
we can relate it with the ocean like the waves of the sea if we relate the vibration of existence as an ocean
the waves of it are the different frequencies in
the vibration moves
can we take the idea of history as just one line imagine the ocean is
a line in the ocean we usually see
we talk about vibration we used to see the uh the graphics as if it is a line doing like
okay
this is two dimensions okay just two dimensions
we is the way we can picture it
a vibration is not one line going like
okay it's just two dimensions to draw it a vibration is everywhere it's going into many dimensions
to understand
we can imagine
the the ocean is not just the layer
you see dividing the air
the water the ocean is the water it
picture
the vibration is if you go deep in the water inside the ocean
there you can see the movement of vibration can you see
is
any line
goes from one spot to another if you are watching the vibration from inside the ocean
all water around you the vibration is not a line going somewhere is everywhere
it's spread in every direction
this is
we also can't neither say
history is something
goes in a line to picture
the universe is like an ocean
the history cannot be moved from one origin
an end towards an end it is just moving around constantly having
in mind is
any destiny to go
there's no destiny there's no way to be a destiny
i don't know
to go there's no line there's no place to move it's all water
let's see
destiny means picture
destiny comes from the latin word
we can divide in de andare is like to stay means stay
destinate means to stay still is very different from
we believe
is destiny
destiny is not to go anywhere destiny means to be every place everywhere
and
is the ability to discover
oneself is the goal of all the things
the question would be for example i am
right
and
the destiny took me to europe
so the destiny made me be in europe
was the destiny for me to be in europe or simply i was the destiny being in europe destiny is not to move forward destiny is to be see can we all hear
now
what it means to accomplish my destiny is to transform myself to build myself
it doesn't matter
you go
do you do
really matters is
you are building yourself you are constructing yourself in each step
you give you are not transforming the future you're transforming yourself
future
is future is not something ahead future is myself vibrating higher
it goes to the future
what was the future the future was higher vibration
the past was lower vibration if i vibrate higher i am in the future if i by very lower i am in the past
i never went to the future i became the future nobody goes to the future everyone becomes the future see
the future
i am going to leave is is related to
i vibrate
this means if i am resounding or dissonant
what is the destiny
is basically all the vibration moving me within the ocean i am just the drop of water within the ocean
the movement of the water around is pushing me okay pushing me constantly
i am a reaction i am a reaction
basically the destiny is
i am the reaction of the outside movement
when the ocean around me is pushing me constantly
is happening
i am the reaction of
movement i accomplish my destiny by allowing me allowing myself to move with the ocean
i cannot accomplish my destiny
i go against the current as they say don't go ahead just let's go step by step
basically the destiny is not something in the future destiny is something
was designed for by the past if i am
in the present
i am going to the future ahead who is pushing me to go forward the past that's the strength
pushes me forward everything
is in the past
that happened in the past will determine the strength with
i will face the future if i am not aware of
usually we are not aware of the ocean we have around if i am unaware of
the past is just pushing me
i accomplish my mission my destiny just
someone pushed me to do it the past pushed me to do it
what is the past we can call it biology uh uh fully patterns uh or mandates um karma everything
built us
made us from the beginning are the ones shaping our strength to accomplish the destiny i can accomplish my destiny
aware of
just by inertia
i realized
the destiny is just to be a tiny part more of the whole
the destinies to be is not to go anywhere it's just to be the reaction of everything
that moves me
suddenly i look around
i say oh there's an ocean i become conscious
i see the ocean
i re i realized
i am a reaction of
ocean
suddenly i realized
my destiny is determined by my karma
not by myself
i just want to change
i don't want to be just a reaction
can i get out of system of being a reaction well i have to transform myself into action reaction action concept library
in the middle of all
in the middle action
action we have the concept
we call free will
what very well first of all i will tell you
it doesn't exist
just to picture it each one of us maybe has a different idea of
it is free will
some of us maybe we or some of you maybe we you can think
free will is just to decide to do whatever i want
i can do whatever i want
it doesn't work like
because i would love to go outside
run
start to fly
even if i move my i move my arms like
i won't fly
why i can't fly
each one my cells are destined destiny has a destiny yeah has a destiny to make another thing
my mind cannot go against everything
i am i have a reality already
is my destiny
was created by my past
remember
the destiny is not something ahead is myself
my past built as a destiny who i am right
and all my destiny has been decided to be
i am
so i cannot go against
destiny has created in me
and
is the most important thing
i can take action
take everything
i am
use it to create something new
for example i cannot fly as a bird
i can create an airplane easy example if you just say your destiny would be my destiny is a human is to be a human
i can do anything about it i just human
i can say well as a human i have
potential
is my mind
my intellect
what i can do as a human is to create a machine
helps me fly i do action
what is free will is the ability to take action within the ocean
this means
the molecule of water is always water
it can decide to be a fish to go into the blood of a human to become a tree
then go back as water to the ocean
this is like i have my own potential as a self
i take action to be something different even if i am still water that's
we call free will free will is not to be whatever you want is to be able to take action through the energy
you are through the essence
you are
implies
i can change my shapes i can sorry my vibration i can vibrate in another frequency in another way remember
the destiny is not
we go destiny is
we become
to accomplish my destiny i can do it unconscious or cons the unconscious way is to react the reaction
the conscious way is to act to take action moment
i decide to take action we used to call it free will
because the will is precisely
to have will to do something
i am still part of the ocean i never left the ocean
in order to build my destiny be clear with
not to accomplish or to go to my destiny to build my destiny
i have to do is to go step by step accomplishing missions we can kind of understand destiny is like a another way to say purpose
purpose comes from the latin word
means per pro in latin
means ahead to put forward
pose to put okay
something
is put forward
purpose is
thing to
we are willing to arrive if my destiny is to become something different
i am willing to achieve ahead is to become
something different
that's
destiny
purpose are kind of similar
mission is like mission is not purpose it's something different mission means to to to send something
from one spot to another to send different things
in order to achieve my destiny
my purpose i have to accomplish different stages
i will call mission the mission is just stages
i set myself like in the school okay
is a perfect example you go to school
you say
you say my mission
is to end uh the first uh grade
then the second one
then the third one
each one is a mission first grade is a mission second grade is another mission third is another mission
in the meantime i go i i go through many tests
missions
are missions are things
i set myself as a goal
missions are not things
i go through are things
i said to myself i have to do it for most of the people school is not a mission
for most of the people of the people school is just something you go through
you are just reacting
it's a reaction of society
you just go through
i finished school maybe i would say
that i have to choose i choose to be a doctor for example
i want to become a doctor
that's a mission
you decide it's your own decision
for example the missions are not great things sometimes they are just tiny things of just one day maybe for example i am very lazy in my life
um
suddenly i say my mission is
tomorrow i will clean my whole house i will put order i will clean everything
that's a mission okay
sometimes for many people would say well
cleaning is not a mission no for some people it really is a mission to clean the house
sometimes
you do it you just realize about a lot of things
you we're leaving behind
you can heal history
the relations with your family
a lot of things from within just like cleaning your house
we should not believe or think
our mission of life is to save humanity uh it's not to save humanity the mission not many people has
mission
they suffer a lot with
normally the missions
we have are most of them daily life our daily life
the task for today is to write down the missions of my life those
i was able to accomplish in my life
those
i wasn't able to accomplish yet
should be submissions of your life
had determined
you are
and the missions
you couldn't accomplish are those
you uh
determine who you are
most of it
are you willing to become
there is no excuses if you are 80 years old
you may say well
i cannot put missions to me
because i am at the end of the path no excuses
one thing is
maybe your body is close to death
is very different from saying your life is ending your life is not ending
is your b
this is life
maybe you would change your body
your missions are still going
all the people
feel old
that are close to death
you are watching
remember you are not at the edge being all person no you are closer to become a child again
being old by being all i am able to set for me missions for the other life to learn in the next life life ends
don't be lazy today the vibration we are going to use like the animal or like the new like something new
the statement of today is i am the emissary of masters
i would like to explain a bit
masters
because the sound wu means um uh means to learn
uh also of course the process of learning is
of the masters
when we are um trying to accomplish destiny of
we want to become is through the wisdom
we achieve
we become
it's like becoming my own master is related with the dharma okay
this is
so the code of today is the spiritual pattern everything
is given must come back returns or to the center again like the planets originating from the sun
coming back in a soft dance falling towards it again the ma sound transports the cosmos to implosion returning to the origin
everything
was experimented becomes coherent let's go to
so as always we begin by um stretching the body carries in the body yawning stretching as i massage touch the body i thanks to it for being the anchor of the spirit in the matter i relax the body focusing in the breathing
imagine
the oxygen goes through your nose to your lungs heart blood organs
muscles me i allow myself to feel the heat within me
how it goes through my skin towards the aura filling up all my magnetic field pay attention to the light of the i am over my head
put my intention to bring all the heat
energy around me as a spiral going up
feeling filling up
i am making it brighter
brighter as a son take deep breath
with your living start to bring down the light of the i am through all your body through your crown their eye throat heart plexus sacrum root knees
with two big rays of light make shine towards your ankles
your feet take a deep breath
recognize in your feet the consciousness of your destiny being still grounded recognize
your feet guides you to your own destiny one step ahead one step behind each one of them refer to my missions those
i accomplished
the other one to the missions
i am willing to achieve take a moment to think about them in your feet take a deep breath
recognize by starting to make the sound the vibration
the light of the i am is activated shining towards every destiny to your own destiny around bringing clarity to each one of your missions those accomplished
those to accomplish um um take a deep breath
recognize
i am my own destiny i become aware
everything
i had done
i have accomplished was the wisdom
i
created
i am
that made my mastery take a deep breath i recognize
all the masters
guides me to my own destiny all of them lived
within me i recognize
all those masters
had guided me towards my purpose all these masters
guides me towards my destiny all their messages are
in me for i am the emissary of the masters i am the emissary of masters i am the emissary of the masters i take my hands to my heart i recognize
all the missions
i had accomplished
all the missions
i am willing to accomplish all of them guide to me to my destiny to my own mastery for i am the emissary of masters i am my destiny i am my purpose i am my master i am the emissary of all masters take a deep breath
i start to bring
consciousness from my heart towards all my body by massaging caressing stretching
yawning
softly i start to open my eyes
coming back
so
you do the list i would recommend you to walk a little bit
to be very aware fully aware of
you make the steps okay to anchor
energy
just put in first the back part of your feet
then going down
like
okay many steps all you need
i leave i wanted to tell you happy new egyptian year
