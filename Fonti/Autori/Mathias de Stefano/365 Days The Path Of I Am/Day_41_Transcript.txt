I hope you are hearing
listening well listening
and watching it well
welcome to
new week
this week we start with the emotional uh aspect in the constellation of Virgo
basically to to begin with
the question would be
are the emotions I wrote today in the blog uh something about it
you could have a bit of the information of
an emotion is most of all let's remember
uh we are under Diego constellation
this is
we are analyzing the emotions
we are not
in
month to um to feel to go to the world of dreamings
to analyze okay
if
is people
maybe use you see me like if I am tired is
here it's 20 30 p.m uh
uh 8 30 P.M
I woke up at 7am
for me it's like very late
I I finished with
and I go to sleep basically like
so let's go to understand the mental aspect of the emotion
why
aspect
not just to feel it
once you understand the basements of
something is
you can handle it
base
happens basically with everything in our lives
until we don't recognize the the aspects of
we are living
we are experiencing we cannot really handle
and we cannot um work with
or transform or take some benefit from them
before we go to to see
it's going to be useful
we are going to do it
Etc uh we have to understand the basis of
it is in order to um understand
we will go with the question of today
is
is emotions in order to do
we have to go to the etymology of the work
emotion means movement it comes from the Latin word
means to move to move forward it comes from X
means to go out
motio
is the movement
basically the emotion is a reaction of movement
how do we feel an emotion
is an emotion from outside will receive pulses of energy okay the movement of everything the energy
is around starts to push itself towards us
that creates a switch of energy inside our body
tries to balance with the energy outside
it creates like
movement of energy towards the inside in positive negative positive negative positive negative creating a chain of reaction
this chain starts to move the molecules
the molecules creates a chemical reaction
this chemical reaction creates
the um makes the hormones to come out of the uh of the of the glands
from the glands these hormones starts to change the reaction of chemistry in our body
through the pulses we receive
information in the neurons in our brain
is processed as um as an emotion as the idea of an emotion
the emotion
that keeps going
I integrate at something common in my life we call
a Feeling not an emotion we call
a Feeling an emotion is a discharge of energy a pulse of energy in just one moment
the feeling is an emotion
is moving constantly is
energy moving constantly Through Time
what are emotions basically emotions are just all the emotions
we have are just the magnetical or electrical reactions within our bodies
I have I have heard a lot of people saying you shouldn't be always in your mind
thinking about
with your mind you just have to Silence Yourself
feel with your heart
what's the problem with
it's just
you are just feeling the pulse
of course you have to feel
is the main idea we have to feel
you have to understand
are you feeling basically
someone says to you don't think much just feel it's exactly the same as saying hey go
and swim in the ocean
someone push you from the from the deck of the of the boat to the ocean
you scream
I don't know
to swim doesn't matter just try to float
of course you know
would happen if you don't know
to swim of course
when you know
to swim
you know the currents you know the waves you know the sea just by going inside the water you learn you you already know
to float
how to flow okay
there's not even need to swim you just go
you feel the ocean
first to do
you needed to learn
is the ocean the currents everything is
easy like learn
to swim
in order to learn
to swim in the emotions I need to learn
is the water
the water moves
how can I move within the water
if we um if we
know
emotion means movement
we can relate every one of the motion with a wave in our inner ocean
we have to learn
this inner ocean is moving
this is
we have to acknowledge
is our relationship with
ocean
we have to think about is
do I relate myself with
ocean with
sea do I rather go to the mountains
don't see the sea or I rather go to the beach
watch the sea or I rather swim in the sea or I rather sail in the sea
there are many ways to be related with the motion
first of all I must recognize from
perspective I watch these emotions
once I do
I can start by working I can I can start with the work of understand
do I relate with
and
can I use
relation
I have with the c
it's very difficult it's very different
when we are are a person
was born to sail
if you were a person
was born to go to the mountains
see the ocean from the mountains
uh the usually
we we
we try to do is to teach everyone
to sail
if you were if you weren't uh born to
so you won't be able to to do it you wouldn't be able to know
to
to handle
situation
this is
it's
important to see myself
position I take with emotions the the example of the C is just an example don't think
that oh I love the sea no it's not the C I'm talking about emotions it's just an example
I just have to picture the ocean as emotions don't don't don't think
that if you like the sea is
you are more emotional no it's not like
it's just an example
you have to do is to imagine
this ocean is all your emotions
that you are
and picture yourself in
position you find yourself in relation with the c
this is something specific to help yourself to understand um
to start to work with emotions from your own perspective we usually want the others to learn from the same point of view
we have
each one of us has a different point of view of
to work with emotions
there is one of the
point of views
for some people is helpful
uh I wouldn't recommend it
is to try to handle the emotions not to handle to control sorry to control the emotions sometimes we have
idea
in order to take control of your life you have to control your emotions
if the emotion is the energy of your being by controlling your emotions you will reach to to work better with your own self to create new realities let's take the example of the um of the sea okay nobody can control the sea it's impossible to control the sea the only thing
you are able to do with the sea is to learn
to swim or
to sell
you take the benefit of the energy of the sea
you can move through the ocean
this is basically
we have to do to to learn to swim or to sail in
wave of energy remember
um
what we have been doing all
week was to move to see the reality from the mind as the vibration
this vibration
it's going to turn into energy the movement okay
this movement is the one
creates the emotions
basically
we have to do with emotions is to understand
they are going through us they are vibration these waves
what we have to do is to just learn
to flow with them
let them flow
they don't get stopped inside of us
is our our job to realize
emotions are like the water of the sea flowing through us
what we have to do is not to stop the flow of the water to control the water
we have to do is to create the perfect path for the water to flow hmm
the only way you can balance the emotional level is by the intention of the Mind
the mind is the one
can put the intention to order the vibration to show a path for
water um we cannot say
we are
to live from the heart or to live from the mind both of them need each other very very deeply they are one
let's remember about the main concept
we said about emotion
emotion is their reaction of the of an Impulse of energy
is coming from the outside towards the inside
can I change something in the outside
when it comes to me it doesn't affect me in the negative way
can I do
without modifying the external world the only way is just by changing my perception of the outside world
for example for example
I I watch something in the news maybe corruption
is a news in the interruption
and um
it gets to me with anger
I feel anger
I'm looking into
so
I changed my perception of
what is
when I see these people
then I say well they do
because they don't know
they are doing
then I change my own perception of the reality same to myself I'm not
so I can be free from
so I can maybe help for it to change
I change my perception of about everything I start to think about the ideas of the world
so on suddenly I feel more pity than anger
every time
I will hear about corruption won't bring me anger will bring me pity I don't know
I am going up in consciousness
just by changing the perception of the outer world I changed the emotion in the inner world the emotion is just a reaction of the outer world
by changing the idea of the outer world the perception of it you just change the sea Within
is
um we go to the basis
in order for us to help our emotions to move properly within our body
we have to do is to go back to the mind
change our ideas of everything around us
this is
for example
I have
I was um angry about something
suddenly I discover the origin of
situation
makes me anger suddenly I feel compassion or
I am frustrated by something um um I was mad with someone
then we talk
I forgive or someone forgive me suddenly I feel compassion I Feel Love the emotion changes just
I changed my idea
basically to know
to sail in
ocean is basically to have to look into the Horizon to look Beyond
to guide myself with the compass towards my own North
that North is
the vision is
where I'm going
I'm heading to we can picture
the body is like the boat
the Sailor is
in the third eye
then in the plexus on the heart the water is breaking okay constantly
you're moving ahead
I guess
this is kind of the idea of
I wanted to explain today
the task for today is to write down maybe just in a paragraph your idea of
your beliefs of
emotions are for you
from
do you watch the emotions
the vibration of today is um is far it's like blowing it's not uh it's not um uh F sound it's not it's far the statement for today is I am the Divine Spark
the sound is to um to blow for the fire to to begin okay that's
the spark the code of today is the spiritual pattern yeah it's not the letter Y it's yeah it says the expansion of the universal of the Universal Mind includes all possible Concepts
dimensions the letter ya represents the diagram of all the ideas
Concepts
resides in all dimensions of time
space it's sound is the vibrational reference of the interdimensional pattern all beings are built by all Dimensions at the same time known can reside in only one of them for all are them just if you if you watch me
I am like kind of slow today
weird um is
