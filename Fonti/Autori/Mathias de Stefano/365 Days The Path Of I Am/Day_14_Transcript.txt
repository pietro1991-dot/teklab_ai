everything in the blog
social media
i am happy i'm glad
i was reading
many comments
um
how many insights they got uh
many insights you got from everything
we are doing
that you are moving a lot of things within
was the goal of course
good cool every day of course i am writing in the blog
what i do writing is more like kind of a diary diary dairy diary notebook whatever a diary to write everything
i
is my process my own process
but i decided to share it to share
inner process with all of you to be like kind of a mirror
you could
you could also be reflected on
and to do the daily work the inside work
i'm glad
that's helping
i've seen
many comments
so i i've read some of the stories
and it's good to feel let's feel
it's helping today um is a day related to the plexus chakra in the week of emotional
chakra the plexus in the muscle aspect is related to the self the only one
is myself
in the emotional it is related to the connection with everything
i have around
everything
is um connected to me inside the main idea of
i wrote today about the the ego
is related to the plexus is
the ego is just a tool a tool to evolution to evolve okay
um ego is
um construction
helps build
is outside
also is built by all the things
is
are outside
this is like a symbiosis to connect with the outer world
we need to know
to handle the ego for sure you have heard many teachings
many uh many masters
many religions or traditions
uh for sure have uh taught you uh about
the ego is stopping you to connect with the divine
one of the main things
you have to do in order to reach the divine is to get rid of the ego
it's like a something
doesn't allow you to to to connect with the divine
um i would say exactly the opposite
those people
maybe are teaching
is
they have worked a lot with the ego with themselves
when someone
have made the path tells you
is not useful
you don't know
it's not useful yet it's not good for you
the ego is the only rule
you have in your daily life is the only thing you have to acknowledge who you are okay in
reality
is
you should not get rid of the ego you need to understand
ego is
to handle the ego
so made the ego a correct tool towards the divine
ego means i i am is ego okay in latin in greek i am ego is not nobody there's nobody in the world without ego
doesn't exist anyone
everyone has a name everyone has everyone is reflected into others
you cannot say never i don't have ego
you exist
of your ego okay
is the only way you can be
what you have to do is to work with the ego in order to be balanced
your ego is is useful for you okay
this is
we are trying to work with in
path we are not against the ego we are helping the ego to be imbalanced one of the things
i was explaining in the text was
the ego is
the divine the self is someone something
knows everything
is everything
the everything the divine can know everything in just one moment in just one spot it cannot create without ego ego is the one
goes away from the center
see respect uh perception
creates all the arts everything
we create daily everything
we wish
we do
we aim in our lives is related to the ego not to the spirit
is
is
important to understand
both of them are one okay
is i am
that's
we are working with
so
is the most important thing
to make the i am you need the i
you need the am okay the i is the creative one
the am is the one with the knowledge with the one with the wisdom
both of them creates everything
we need to balance both of them in order to be a whole we cannot eliminate the i in order to um
i was relating in the blog
the ego is like the earth with an axis
from the axis spins itself okay
center is the ego
this axis is also moving okay
this creates the seasons spring summer autumn winter these changes are different perspectives of the ego okay
the ego is always the same axis
what happens
movement in greek you you may say it ism
when we say
is a schism uh earthquake is an ism okay
comes from the greek word
the movement of the self the ego we would say egoism egoism means
my axis my ego is moving towards different directions to invade different spaces the egoism is not bad
the bad aspect of the ego is
the axis moving itself suddenly forgets about its own center
wants to become the center in
place
it is projected imagine
when we are moving
way we are facing the spring
in the other side we are facing the autumn
what happened
this uh
this movement okay stops
the axis instead of moving around just wants to be spring constantly spring
the planet starts to die
you cannot be constantly spring
is the wrong act the negative aspect of egoism for an example imagine
you are seeking for for spirituality
you just
you
you are willing to prove
spirituality
you go to for example islam judaism christianism orthodox whatever
you prove each one of them the image would would be the ego goes to each one of these religions
he wants to acknowledge to understand different perspectives of the spirituality for itself for the ego it's not for the other ones it's
i am looking for it okay i am the one looking for
enlightenment
i look for different ways spring summer autumn
different regions the bad aspect of the egoism is
i move to one of those religions
suddenly i say oh
one is the one
for example i picked the islam
i said
one is the one i go to the judaism i go to the christianism i go to the hinduism or whatever
i know the door
say hey you have to become islamic
this is the one okay hey
is the one hey
is the one
i start to move my ego into the others i'm not looking for my own enlightenment i am pushing the others towards mine each time
you are seeking for something not spirituality whatever
you are looking for you are looking at
of you
it makes you happy or whatever okay
what you are trying to reach is egoism is selfish
it's not bad it's not bad
you are looking it for yourself okay you are not pushing anybody to the good
you believe is good okay
get rid of the moral
the cultural aspects of the aim
just
just be yourself okay
this is
um we have to acknowledge
we are doing
path the question would be
that we are doing is
we want to transform ourselves
to help others just by allowing them to see
i am changing or
i want to change everyone okay
according to the example i did uh
the egoism touches with egocentrism
egocentrisms mean
i am the center of everything
imagine
you go to
religion
you think
is the one
i pick
and i say
is the center
this is my truth
i am the center of everything
it touches with egoism
it's try it tries to go to the others to say
is a
is a center okay
someone is preaching um like for example um uh preaching is not equal to egoism okay
because for example um for example the witnesses uh they go to your house
they just want to share their their wisdom their knowledge their faith with everyone
they are meant to do
but
doesn't make them selfish or or or selfish or with egoism
what they're doing is just sharing their love to their religion
they are not forcing you to think like them they are just trying to share
to make you question just
so uh it's not the same okay different would be if they open the door
say hey you have to be like us or you will go to hell or whatever
maybe some of them do
i don't know um
uh mostly they are not like
so they just are preaching their truth okay
is totally different from egoism of course we can speak hours about
but i just wanted to share the main concepts
ideas remember we are in the second week of the month of leo
is the concept of i can
the vibration of today is
i with the two dots um it's like a i said like pronounced within
it's like ear ear
the sound ear in the ancient times
represented like the flag or the shield of a of a population a country a village it represented the con
unified everything
was related to
okay
that's it
is
the statement of today is i am love in things
this is
today we relate with the plexus
is the connection
myself has with everything around me
the code
of today is the vibration r
it says the i am the sense to contemplation
becomes aware of everything
has projected
all
that all
created corresponds directly to the culture
the creator is directly a reflection of its creations the eye resonates like the echoes of fatality creating the science posings of the dream
the awaken okay
the code of today is basically
is about
the consciousness starts to spread creating everything
how the everything creates the creator itself okay it's also related with the self
is created with the things
surround it
the cycle today is like um it's like i am the creator i hate everything
that everything begins to create myself let's go to
look for a comfortable position stretch your body if necessary i start to caress my body softly remember
we are careers in touching the body to honor it to let it know
we thanks him for everything
it does every day to make the spirit be anchored
living
and
and i relax my body letting my weight fall down shoulders arms
hands foster my breathing always through the nose breathe in
breathe out by the nose
i visualize the oxygen going to my lungs my heart blood organs
muscles i start to feel the heat of my body coming in every direction feeling my aura
i allow myself to feel the color
is surrounding me i take a deep breath
become aware of the hottest part of my body
i can find the most quantity of emotions without judgment i allow myself to feel recognize these emotions i take a moment to think about everything
i have done today
their relations
my emotions has with each one of them
emotions i am feeling the most just let myself perceive them without thinking much take a deep breath
recognize the emotions
i have felt today
that i have
and
with me i'm aware
these emotions are the fuel the energy
my higher self has chosen me today to become the field to nourish the seed of my plexus take a deep breath i take my with my hands
emotion
always it around my plexus from the front
the back like a wheel of charcoal i become aware
in the center of my plexus i find the seed of my ego everything
i see around in my life is the perception of my ego
everything
is surrounding me conditions the ego to be
it is i take a moment
to think about everything every person project situation
is linked to me
is related with my ego attached to me don't think much just allow the images to come to you feel the energy of the ego like tentacles around connecting to those people persons objects
citizens from the past
the present take a deep breath i recognize everything
i am today is due to everything
is connected to me right
and i recognize
everything around me connect me exists depending on me i make a question to myself is my ego really centered on itself it's my ego moving around correctly take a deep breath
bring the consciousness of the i am into plexus i can be the center the right center i can move in balance
harmony i can't be myself my vibration
having
potential in me acknowledging
i can be is to activating of my chakra makes pin the wheel of emotion faster
faster i keep pronouncing the sound once
again as i pronounce my vibration i see i imagine
the light of the plexus starts to shine like a thirst in all the directions consuming the feel of the motion around it i feel as i pronounce the sound
all these links
connect me with those people objects
situations start to burn becoming ashes spreading the light of the plexus around i recognize
that i am a sun in the center of a system of planets
i can see these people objects
situations becoming planets going around myself in balance harmony as the sun is brighter
brighter i start to see many other suns like stars shining in bison all the people
is starting to bride as me creating their own solar system with our own planets shining within
big galaxy each one of them the center of its own world
even though taking part of the whole equilibrium
so i observe the light
connects us all
i pronounce i am the life in all things i am the life in all things i am the life all things breathe in i take my hands to the heart i remind myself
the only way to find the essence of the being is by the potential of the self i am who i am i am who i am i am who i am
softly in my own time i start to spread through my whole body
truth carries in each part of my body stretching all the body unjoining i open my eyes come back
and
remember
maybe you will feel tired
your body needs to assimilate
information
rest remember if you feel nauseous or dc go to the ground
let all the energy go away above all just sleep rest thank you for being
thank you for shine
see you tomorrow bye
