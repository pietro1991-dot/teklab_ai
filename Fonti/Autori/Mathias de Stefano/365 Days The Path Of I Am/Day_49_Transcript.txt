palatos Como estan hi everyone how are you 
hear me well so another another day with everyone 
here around so today um 
we work with the feet with ink related to the emotional week 
in vehicle constellation so today 
what I wrote in the blog is very connected with the issue that we 
we have been working with in the pyramid in in Katherine PMA with the group 
uh related with um with the seven laws 
what we have been what we've been working today is uh really with 
um related with the seven laws of the universe which in concept of in the Atlantic 
philosophy what it means is um that there is seven laws that 
organize the universe so maybe you know those laws uh from the chivalion 
um the book of Hermes uh 
it's coming like the storm lots of 
foreign so what I was just saying is that in the 
pyramid we have been um working with the seven laws of the Universe 
um inside the and the thing is that we uh well that 
that we know this loss from the chivalion from Aramis 
so um according to the to the Atlantean 
philosophy related to the laws of the Universe um 
not only seven laws there are many laws that they come from seven 
and this seven also comes from one law the mentalism 
so basically the other laws are just extensions from the mind 
so basically what um everything is a perception of the 
Mind so from that perception of reality 
comes the other loss that is the correspondence 
vibration Rhythm cause and effect polarity and generation 
I won't describe this loss now because we are going to work with them in another in another month 
and this is that um from one law 
there is projected another seven laws and from those seven are born around 
um 36 uh and other laws in the universe 
and also what we call through this loss is how the reality starts to divide and 
to express itself so from the mind everything starts to be 
um organized so basically the dimensions are the expressions of this laws are the 
um conceptual aspect of the universal laws each dimension 
so basically all the dimensions are born from the perceptions the perspectives 
and expressions of these seven laws 
which comes from um the mind the perception of the Mind 
so understanding that is the mind that puts itself to 
to the external to create the universe we will realize that the mind of the 
universe is trying to do um is to create everything to see to 
understand what it has within what is capable of the mind the cosmic mind 
what it's trying to do is just to express what it has outside 
so they could so so the same universe could have the possibility to experience 
all the uh all the potentials that it has 
the universe starts to look for them 
to look for its own potential through creation 
so basically the universe is a mind 
that creating everything to be able to experience to see to look 
for the potentially the degree 
so what the universe does is to create a path 
could find that um potential 
so the first step that the Universe does is to create an idea 
and that idea that was within inside goes into the outside to be seen 
that's the first step that the universe made what the universe does is to 
express the idea that it has within so he can see it in the outside what the universe does by projecting it 
outside is create a positive projection into the outside 
that while it it becomes the observed comes in again as a projection we call 
that the positive going outside and the negative going Within 
in this process it's like a wave of positive and negative 
and come back comes back as positive and negative creating a wave 
so this creates another law which is that everything that is inside expressed 
outside project its connection like a vibration so 
everything is connected by vibration so the pulse the the this vibration is 
expressed into the outside and comes back to the side as a pulse 
and this creates like a cycle going outside like a bit and then it goes 
inside the law of rhythm 
so until that moment we have mentalism which is the idea then correspondence which is the 
projection into the outside then we have the vibration that connects with this wave the inside and the 
outside and then we have the Rhythm which is the time it is that vibration to repeat 
so then I realized that from the inside 
from the inside I just push this intention to the 
outside so what I'm what I'm doing is to creating a cause and then that energy 
comes back again with that vibration and we call that consequence 
everything that I have inside from the inside towards your side as it 
costs and then it goes it comes back to me as 
a consequence the force that creates the uh the cause 
and the force that creates the consequence are the two horses 
that reality so we call that the positive and the negative which is polarity the law 
of polarity is the one that it's constantly the energy by moving 
into positive and negative what the movement of positive and negative 
generates is the last law which is Generation to generate 
so this is what we would call the path of Creation in the universe for the 
universe is not something different it's not separate things it's just all the 
same process and connected all of them are the same but we have divided it so 
we could understand the step by step of this process so basically what we 
acknowledge about this process of universe is that there is no a plan 
organized through all process that is just 
so there is no uh planification in this expression 
so remember for the universe no division stuff we are the ones that divide the steps of 
how the universe is um it is creating 
for the universe everything happens in the in the same mode at the same time so it's all part of the 
same process at once we are the one created the last 
spot of the of the creation of the universe was the generation so once that 
um um ones that we have accomplished 
this uh of generation we appear as humans as beings in this reality 
so by being already created what we can do is to turn around and to see back 
and to attend the steps that we took in 
order to exist is in that moment from the ego from the separation that we start to divide the 
steps of the creation so this is the moment 
when we conceive the universe as a planification 
this is the moment when we start to think about the universe 
as God has 
comes a new law which is related with the knees 
the knees are the ones that um 
that um create the concept of the purpose 
purpose is a purpose is the concept that we give 
to the universe so we create the idea of a plan 
one create the idea of the purpose is when 
we go back we go down to the feet and we to 
the path towards the mission we start to 
accomplish our mission we have to do this that is the ego the I 
the mind of the eye the one that creates the idea 
purpose and Mission what the universe does 
is to create a free system we have free will and how is that the 
Universe the only thing that does is create because if this would have a plan 
so it wouldn't allow us to create our own reality 
so they permission appears at the moment when 
the I the I am in this line uh the ego recognized that 
it took a long time a long process we 
so when the mind starts to realize that in order to be created 
needed any stages so that was the moment 
when that was the moment when um we understood that there was like a 
planification like a planning of the creation we divided the creation so that's what we decide that there is a 
purpose on that planetification one of the things that we have to acknowledge about this is that the 
Universe has given us the the gift able to create our own purpose 
so when we realize that we are able to create a purpose so we acknowledge that 
we have to start with the Sikh seeking 
so basically the process of seeking is to try to understand the logics 
in each one of the parts that has created me 
so in this idea of um of seeking this meaning of everything we 
start to create many purposes and many missions around 
but what we have to see about this is that we picture our goals our process of 
seeking the reality the truth um 
we realize that all the purposes and missions that we 
have are not related to the neutralization they are all moved by emotions 
and the reason why it's moved by emotions is because we have expectations 
so basically there we find the answer that everything that we 
trying to to find a purpose 
to accomplish a mission they are not because they are meant to be for the universe 
but we are doing it because we need to calm the ego 
so the ego is the one that was trying to find a meaning in all the parts of the 
creation so this is why it creates a purpose given meaning 
when the universe doesn't have a purpose it's only purpose is to create 
so we would say here meaning of everything so if we don't have a purpose really 
but the the truth is uh 
the reason that we or the the the concept that 
um that can create a is also part of this creation 
so we understand this next uh example 
so I was given the example of this today that for example the brain is an organ 
that cannot feel the person have feelings cannot sense anything so that's why it 
needs the the nervous system in order to 
receive information through positive and negative through all the 
the nerves in in the body and the nerves brings this information 
because of the feelings the the exceptions the sensitive perceptions of 
um of um of the body of the physical body 
for the mind to understand the reality it needs a soul that moves this energy 
and the Soul needs a body to experience this energy so it could be processed 
so this means that the brain in order to feel to understand the ideas that it has 
it needs a body feels that divides that creates purpose 
that accomplish missions to feel to perceive they that he has created it has created 
so basically the universe doesn't address or a mission 
but it needs for us to create purposes and missions in order for the universal mind to 
understanding of what it has created I hope you got it 
so this doesn't mean that because of course that's the purpose 
we don't have it neither exactly because the universe doesn't 
have a purpose we are the ones that need to create that for the universe 
but acknowledging that the universe doesn't have a specific purpose 
gives us the free will to be able to create our own 
so this is why the process of seeking 
is the one that allows us to create always different creation perspectives pages 
this is why you would say that the destiny of everything 
is the process of seeking itself and this is why the universe 
gave us the death as a gift because death is the thing that has to 
go back to life and try to find and meaning to seek for a meaning and a 
purpose on everything 
so this is why the question that we have to do ourselves is 
what is the emotion or the feeling that we project in our mission and 
in our purpose because basically why we 
uh purpose and a mission is just to give sense to our own life 
so remember that we project that according to 
emotions so is the body that needs the emotions 
to survive so this is why 
what we have projected in our life is as a purpose 
is just projected from the emotions 
that we Express in our lives so this is why the question for today is 
what are the emotions and the feelings that I am projecting in my 
um in my life in my purpose and Mission 
so that's it for more details to blog 
so let's go to the information of today remember that we work today with the 
ankles and feet the sound we are going to use the 
vibration we are going to use today is some few 
so the statement for today is I am the spark that guides that guides me in the 
path today we start with the patterns of the Soul so the code we have for today is 
the soul pattern ha which is the h 
it says by coming with all their power the soul ignites 
and with it all did all its memories history and false 
in all directions without linear linearity 
where times becomes a new sphere where past present and future are nothing more 
than the Rhythm the melody and the harmony of the song 
the sonorous page ha is the pattern of time of the waves of the webs that 
connects us Life After Life experience after experience 
remember the sound Who I Am the spark that guides
