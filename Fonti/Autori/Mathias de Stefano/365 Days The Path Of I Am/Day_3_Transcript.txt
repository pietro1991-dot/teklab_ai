hi everyone good night good evening good morning whenever you are thank you for being
to be connected for
third day of alignment
to start I just wanted to tell you
I sh I I post um posted a new Post in the blog
uh I'd say it's something I write
I go to the pyramid I I hope it is useful for you uh
each day
I go to the pyramids I do some chantings
uh
do
the chantings it comes like words like ideas
and some stuff
um um
then I just I write down all
thoughts um to from the eye
the arm
conversation between both of them
um I don't know if it's going to be every day
um as well I can I I will do it
we go to the alignment of today
I remember you
um we are still in the wake of the Mind
of course inside the month of holak the first cycle
is the month related to Leo for
the Mantra of
whole month is I can
statement we are going to work with today is I am the portal of Truth
is related to the throat chakra foreign means M the portal
E is the letter or the sound
represents the feather with
you write the truth
is in the ancient mythology
this is the sound
made the reference to the door opening to the truth
also of course we have the code of the day
is another information just to uh let it go through your body for the recognizement of
code of information
read the code exhalation related to the process of expression
inhaling
observing decides to take action expanding outwards outwards searching to reach everything that's projected of living every potentiality every dream
idea
waits to be lived in its presence
related with the process of the third chakra
it's exhalation it's to let the information out
it's
Universe expressed itself towards the outside
it expanded its own potentiality
it could leave every potentiality
he has
he has Within yeah hmm
today we are going to concentrate ourselves with the throat chakra something Basics to understand um I was saying
something important to to understand is
if we feel anything uncomfortable anything
is um making us feel uh fear I feel fear um you just let it go to the ground maybe like touching your body like
like taking the Statics okay like letting let it all out
it's just the discharge of the energy okay it's just uh stuff
are going out
sometimes um some of the fears
some of the things
we feel is not even ours stuff
we have from our past not only past lives
also our ancestors
live within us
many of the fears
we have been they are not
um they're not
we have them
because in our uh in our inside we have their emotions
they lived
um Bannings of expressing the truth
they were um I don't know being judged or whatever
we're going to work to work with the throat
let it all out
this is something very difficult for many of the people in the past
let's um I will put the music
let's find a comfortable position uh for
alignment
some people were were doing some comments about um I'm feeling like the body is weird or I am I'm tired or I cannot sleep um
these things are normal
we are downloading information new information to our bodies
it's it's of we will feel strange things
if we don't if we don't feel anything is
we are not doing it well it's not
we are doing
and life it's like normal
of course you will feel some changes
the body needs to re-adapt to the new things that's
why we are
so we position ourselves comfortable let's say the music if I can can you hear me well said your body comfortable remember to be still with your spine straight
up never laying down always with your head what's
guy I close my eyes
I touch my body carries my body or make a massage the reason
we touch the body
we meditate to let the body know
it is part of
process
we are moved energy through it thank you
