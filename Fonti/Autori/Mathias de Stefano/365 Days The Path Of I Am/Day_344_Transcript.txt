hi everyone good morning good afternoon good evening 
well so after being this deep 
um process I think I'm gaining um strength back so 
um after all this cleaning I kind of feel I'm 
going out again from that from the subconscious and the 
unconscious going to into the conscience let's go to the topic for today which I 
have no clue really about what I should share 
from it so the topic for today is leaves 
the leaves of the tree related to the heart 
which is to give and receive 
so the leaves of the um the leaves of the plant represent the 
heart of the tree of the plants because um the heart of uh 
the attribute of the heart is basically to give and receive 
um so every heart is about that to give and receive and 
the leaves in a plant are the ones um that work with that 
through a process that we call photosynthesis 
which I ask if you all know what is this photosynthesis 
I will make a very short summary of what is 
photosynthesis what I am doing right now is it's really 
a mess so I hope you kind of get it so this is very like a like a summary so 
um I'm not going into details to clarify this here is a leaf so 
just to clarify the image so in a leaf we have chlorophyll I don't 
know in English how you say it chlorophylla which is this element pigment that that 
is able to to grab the the photons are the particles of 
chlorophyll okay thank you that are the particles of of the light so from the 
Sun the Rays of the sun we get photons which are all these particles that in a 
certain wavelength which is around 500 nanometer 
the chlorophyll um get that that photons and that's why we 
see the trees like green that's why we see green because of the 
wavelength that the chlorophyll gets the the light chlorophylla chlorophyll is the one that 
gets the photons because a demonstration of photons is the one that will give 
energy to the plant we need energy the plant needs energy 
so we will grab it from the photons in a way way the plant needs energy 
because the plant creates its own food it needs to energy to create its own 
nutrients in a different way in which we do it that we eat things from the outside the 
plant the plants needs to create its own food within 
so what happened here that this energy will be used to create its own food the 
way in which it does it is taking the inorganic um 
materials that are around in the environment for example the 
carbon dioxide which means carbon dioxide is one carbon 
and dioxide is D is do and oxide is 
oxygen so two part two of oxygen so 
carbon dioxide it takes that and what what is through the chemical reaction of 
the energy of the sun is divide the oxygen with the carbon it gets the 
carbon and turns it into organic something organic it takes the oxygen 
outside and takes the only carbon from the other side 
comes the water from the roots of the plant so the water which is um 
age to o so two hydrogen and one oxygen it does 
exactly the same with the chemical reaction through energy the energy of the sun helps inside the leaf to 
separate the oxygen take it away you don't need that and the plant doesn't 
need that and just stays with the hydrogen so the connection between the 
hydrogen and the carbon will gives us the 
um carbs the carbon heat I don't know the English in English the name of 
um carbs um carbohydrate I don't know the name so 
basically um they create this which is the sugars okay uh is the base of glucose for the 
plants um carbohydrates thank you 
uh carbohydrates so it creates this which is the base for all food that then 
we eat from plants and animals and so on so we get that Sugar from this so the 
plant is creating this food okay as a summary here the plants the leaves 
will take the inorganic things plus the light of the Sun and through a chemical 
reaction with this energy they divide the the molecules of water and carbon 
dioxide expelling all the oxygen and just staying with carbon and 
hydrogen to create cartwritis that creates the sugar the glucose which 
is the food for the plant all this is the process of photosynthesis 
so all processes of photosynthesis gives us this idea that all the inorganic 
elements like the that are things that can hurt us straight light of the sun 
and the carbon dioxide in the oxygen in the in the air uh that can harm our 
structures are processed by a chemical reaction inside the plant creating energy that 
allows the plant to create food for itself and also for us 
it transforms everything that usually can kill us or do any harm to us and 
makes it into food for us and also the things that the plant doesn't need that 
says eat this I give it away so is the oxygen 
so the oxygen is the one that lives that let us breathe so the plants are giving 
us basically life through food and through the oxygen that we breathe 
uh giving it away receiving the bad things and giving the good things for us 
so we breathe the oxygen which is what the plans doesn't need to leave and 
the need for leaving but um um 
but one important thing to know is that when we 
breathe um we bring this energy to the cells and 
all the the excess of energy in the cells that means that needs to be released from our body from all the 
carbohydrates that we have consumed all this exists excess of of it comes into air again 
from our breathing into carbon dioxide so we breathe in the air and we breathe 
out the carbon dioxide which is basic for the plant to produce 
its food so the plant is basically producing the food and antigen we need 
to leave for a living and um and we receive that 
um that that oxygen that they don't need and give them back through carbon 
dioxide which is the basement for their uh food so this is a perfect cycle of 
giving and receiving so what we what we can take from nature 
here is how nature takes the things that can hurt us that can harm us 
and transform it into energy through a chemical reaction into food 
and things that can allow our life 
for us to be alive so this has created 
through millions of years an idea in our planet that we need to take the bad 
things from the environment to transform it within ourselves in order to create good things 
so here is how we get to understand how about 
the concept of today related to pain 
and pleasure the photosynthesis and the way of breathing 
helps us to understand from a very natural and biological point 
of view um why we 
commonly as humans go through these um 
suffering processes in life repeatedly 
so remember that the way in which we perceive the environment the the issue 
um is through our brain and um basically the brain has been decided 
designed to receive the data from the outside through five senses these five 
senses um receive the the impulses from the 
outside and even if there are specific organs to 
assimilate specifically that data in the brain all of that get mixed in order to 
have a complete image of what we are feeling so there is a coherence in them 
and then in the whole picture in the whole information 
is [Music] Ricardo 
dautos del mundo externo para Creer uni machine completely internal 
so remember that um 
the nervous system um this information different information 
from the outside in order to create one complete data in the inside for the 
understanding so basically the brain is like receiving 
data and stress that data according to different levels it's not like putting 
information like this is bad and this is wrong uh the brain kind of interpreted one 
data that receives according to all the rest of the data and it kind of in one 
only line Usher um determines if it is a high vibration 
or a low vibration um of information 
um I know that you are not seeing it properly but anyway I don't have 
other thing so for example I have here one thing 
and here I have five senses 
so for example I have this object here and I'm receiving information from this object through these two 
here through these two senses and I have 
information from the other senses through pre-concepts of things that I had before 
so I have a pre-concept of this object that I am perceiving through this only two 
from all these three concepts and these experiences the brain will connect all 
this information as only one so to try to get the whole picture of it 
and from that it will try to put 
in this measurement where I refer to this data to this 
information is only one thing that can measure if 
it's a low or high perception of what I am receiving 
it's not different things so it's the brain trying to locate 
this according to all the data from before that determines if we are suffering or if we are enjoying it 
um so this is the brain 
so this is why all the information all the data that comes through the the 
senses and the free data that already has the brain through the senses that we 
all know smell side um 
hearing touch taste from these five senses 
um the brain interprets all this information that determining 
where this data would be so it can understand it 
so the reason why the brain does this to interpret it in which level it is fine 
it is found it was found because it needs to find where 
where and what actions should it take regarding that object 
if all the pulses takes me to this level so I will find in this level the 
reactions that I will have according to this if I feel pain with this object if I feel attacked by 
this object so I will know now according to this level of measurement if I need 
to run or I have to find feedback or whatever okay so it's because I need to 
know what reaction I should take according to the object 
so this isn't one of receiving and giving 
so a basic example would be fire you have fire here this is fire so 
through the senses you can experience fire from from 
two ways from two different things um 
you can experience fire um in a good way like for example uh fire 
being in um how do you say in um 
in a fireplace so the one is around so you so you look into the fire and 
everyone is sharing like a family like a romantic moment so 
um so the information that comes from the fire will go to pleasure because 
it's like oh I relate this with with eating all together with cooking with uh 
feeling the heat of the fire to feel warm and so on so um so my my real yeah okay to get closer 
to the fire to feel the heat and so on but if this fire is burning the house so the census will send the image of 
something burning so I will perceive the fire as something bad for me so the 
reaction would be to run away from the fire it's a simple 
um thing so what happened here that this is not something something mechanic so it's 
something that depends on each person so basically for each individual the 
relationship with the fire would be very different for some people it's painful for some people is is something amazing so 
according to its own per experiences and pre-concepts of the fire a person will 
Define how it feels what do we have here that 
humans well I believe in being measure the pain 
and the pleasure according to this Only Rule and that makes that some that the 
brain interpretates pain and pleasure with the same tool so that's why some people cannot 
make a difference in between one or another so for example uh there are people that 
cannot measure the or doesn't have a preconcept of the fire or something 
wrongins with the interpretation of pleasure so uh they cannot difference 
one from another so that's P that's people that instead of um of filling the fire as something 
um uh that gets you together with a family or something romantic they find pleasure 
on burning the house and putting fire to things to people to whatever 
so this means that every person has a different way of understanding these two 
so everything has a very different scale to measure what is pleasure and what is 
pain so for example there are people that feels pleasure on hurting others 
so they feel pleasure and now that's why they feel that it's okay 
this is why humans we created morality and ethics 
so we created morality and ethics as a way to control 
somehow this image between Pleasure and Pain 
so what happened here that what before was just 
an interpretation of the brain of what is pleasure and what is playing 
now it becomes something forbidden 
and by becoming something forbidden it goes straight to the unconscious 
it gets in the unconscious because of morality and ethics 
so what is the problem here with these forbidden things is something that we spoke many times 
about morality what is morality morality is something 
that can be only attributed by some specific space and a specific time 
which means that what for us today is something immoral 
for the past maybe it wasn't and the other way around 
this is because our perception of the environment changes according to 
time and space so what for us today is forbidden for other cultures maybe it's not 
and the other way around this is why it's very difficult to judge 
what is really Pleasure and Pain as to what is 
forbidden so besides morality changing Through Time 
all the things that we have been um banned from that we are not able to 
do they got into the unconscious and this unconscious is inherited through time 
through every generation so even if morality changes in our unconscience we still have the memory 
of those other things 
of those things that are hidden this is why in the unconscious many of 
those pleasures and pains becomes 
paraphilia I don't know English it's the same I guess paraphilia 
so what is a paraphilia a paraphilia is like another path to take 
which is Ophelia means the love to love something 
uh so the philias are controlled by a morality 
but paraphilia are not controlled by morality so they say that's 
another thing like another path that you are taking which is not through morality 
it's a parallel reality so we can also call this perverse 
perverse is another another way 
from Universe remember universe is the only one path and perverse is like a 
path that is aside that is a path aside which is not the right one 
so that's per verse for sure someone can say maybe 
because someone is something that is not good in any place or any culture and I 
would say no uh because for some culture 
for some moments it was a pleasure to kill someone it was normal part of the morality 
so we cannot judge how we see things 
um it's according to a time space 
for us can be perverse of course but for others is not perverse 
so if I myself thinking something that is perverse according to a morality 
it makes me someone that cannot share with the other people in this morality 
what I'm thinking what I am willing to do is perverse for the most of the other people so I have to hide it from the 
other people which goes straight to the unconscious 
so when it goes to the actions it goes straight to the folder of forbidden 
what brings me have erratic 
behaviors there's no one no human on earth that 
doesn't have any perversion in their minds within the unconscious 
we all have those and one of the best 
perversions that we people have 
the pleasure of feeling a victim 
so one of the biggest perversions would be this this love for 
feeling a victim because through that we can feel that 
the others will take care of me and we'll 
love me because I am feeling bad 
so this makes that in our society in our civilization 
are created two uh different ways of pleasure 
one which is the pleasure of the masked 
which is the one loving to become a victim 
and the other one is the sadist which is 
the one that loves to create victims this is because we are a violent species 
that has found the survival through violin through 
fight this is why through thousands of years 
many have found a way to gain power through creating victims 
and others to gain power through becoming a victim 
and this has created a recurrent feeling in humans which is 
the pleasure on things 
that makes us suffer a little bit 
so I proposed to you to look for that in your daily life 
like um how it is to 
for example in which places you find pleasure everything that 
makes you suffer like watching a movie listening into some music 
with some friends in some relationships 
whatever so it's just watching to normal things like 
for example what happened to me yesterday I saw for the second time the same series that makes me suffer like 
like um crying and if I am willing to feel fine 
why not to see something to laugh 
why I see something that makes me suffer 
and I was feeling like fine with that 
or for example when we listen into music if I feel a little bit bad 
why would I choose to listen songs that make me feel sad 
that makes me feel much more this sadness 
what we do with this kind of this type of things is feeling 
finding pleasure in the suffering 
and this is when we um this is when where we remember 
photosynthesis 
so what does the photosynthesis 
with us the example of photosynthesis shows us 
that you can take all these bad things from the environment 
and turn them into something good food 
energy for our life 
so what we can understand is that 
suffering pain is a tool that the brain uses 
to understand pleasure 
so when we feel pain that is measuring 
where can we have to position our interpretation to transcend what we 
are feeling pain is something that have that helps us to understand a process we 
are going through so suffering becomes not something that 
you have to eliminate from your life but it is a tool like in music offering 
would be the the low pitch of music like 
you cannot eliminate the low frequencies in music because 
they are like the ones that helps to understand the music 
not eliminate the low nodes just because you like the 
high notes both help to each other 
to make a sense so basically the real problem that we 
have here is not to feel bad or to feel fine 
the real problem is that those two feelings send into the unconscious 
we send it there because of morality so it was so hidden 
that 
it turned into a pathology like for example 
um pedophilia necrophilia 
this kind of mental diseases or whatever we can call them 
um they are there are Pleasures that people find because they 
locked the real pleasures and pains in the unconscious 
if they would have been able to express the real pleasures 
maybe we wouldn't have those problems so it's all about what we have hidden in 
our unconscious this is why it's so important for us to 
start to recognize this pleasure and this pains in our 
unconscious to understand what are our emotional 
paraphilia in that way we can do like 
photosynthesis taking all these and negative stuff and turn them 
into nutrients food the ways in which we can do this is 
to transcend those sufferings and those paraphilia that we have inside is by 
sharing it how by art painting it writing it talking it with 
someone mention it into a fifth thing so you get aware and 
conscious about it taking it Taking it out so it's not just within you 
so you can start to transcend and take the suffering as a tool for 
your own evolution 
so this is why when people say for sure there's a lot of people saying we do 
this for to end the suffering in the planet to end with the pain in the in in this humanity and it's important it's 
impossible this is impossible to eliminate because suffering and pain 
are not a real thing outside they are a way of measurement 
of perception inside your your brain 
the only thing that we have to do is to know how to balance 
the levels of the music the song but we cannot eliminate the notes 
so let's do like the trees and through our unconscious 
let's make photosynthesis vibration today is z 
the statement today is I am the heart's vibration the code today is the age of Libra 
between the years thirteen thousand twenty and fifteen thousand hundred 
seventy BC approximately the constellation of Libra marked the history of the beginning of Atlantis and 
the end of what was called lemuria this means moose colonies from the Indian and 
Pacific Ocean during this period where developed the humans as we know them the 
culture and the language that we that would determine the way the next 
civilizations through sit comfortable close your eyes 
and concentrate in your breathing 
[Music] 
let me take a deep breath and recognize it's my entire body 
bringing my attention to my feet [Music] [Applause] 
[Music] 
I use my imagination [Music] see my left foot the coming 
roots in every direction 
throwing down deep [Music] 
to the Earth [Music] 
I imagine how my hip waist chest and back 
turns into this trunk covered by the crust emerging from the 
ground [Music] 
my arms and hands 
my neck and head they turned into branches 
and throughout my senses to the touch sight taste smell earrings 
appear all the leaves that covers all the tree that I am 
[Music] 
I can contemplate thousands of leaves oh yeah the Tree of Life 
children 
[Music] 
I recognize that I breathe 
all the things that surrounds me like the light of the Sun 
turning on [Music] 
all the things of this world [Music] 
the energy Within Me to this sense [Music] 
what I perceive from the world feels what I feel in me 
and what I feel I need builds the world outside 
[Music] 
I become aware of all the things that comes me outside [Music] 
[Applause] so it makes me feel pleasure or pain 
that I didn't suffer 
[Music] 
Ed and so I become aware of 
the painful things [Music] that I feel pleasure of 
it I'm the same way I recognize 
all the pleasures in which I feel 
pain and suffer George [Music] 
I take a deep breath and into one of them 
foreign [Applause] 
[Music] 
take deep breath I assimilate all of them 
recognizing that they are full that nourished me for my own evolution 
[Music] 
foreign 
colors coming up on my feet falling spiral to my body to get into my 
heart with its eyes [Music] 
bringing clarity to what I feel is my unconsciousness 
[Music] 
thank you 
[Music] 
I recognize all forbidden things [Music] and I turn all of them into food
