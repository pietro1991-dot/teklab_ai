hi everyone good morning good evening good night
i hope ready to begin with the famous thymus thymus yes
here
i hope the task
i gave you yesterday was good
there are not things
you should do day by day these are things
um
i am just giving to you
so you could work it at any time not just day by day
any day
today we are going to talk about the thymus
this gland we usually relate
gland with a high heart chakra
also related with the unconditional love
i was about to say is um
we usually relate
gland with the unconditional love
this unconditional love is just um not all the time
is just
you are ready to love unconditionally
what we have to speak about is the purpose of
of
center
you get to unconditional love one of the things
um
we usually hear about
chakra is
if you love unconditionally everything in the world you will feel balance you will feel the love of everything
the truth is
in order to get into
love into feel
uncon uncommonly aspect of it you need to go through a long process you need to go through the understanding of
is happening with them
so in order to do
we need to stand the purpose of
gland
that chakra is anchored is manifested we usually
we talk about the chakras
the goals
purposes purposes of the chakras we usually think about the the spiritual concepts the energetical concepts
they are way away from ourselves in a in an invisible aspect of our reality
we are in the physical one
we need to relate the purpose of those chakras to the glands
are the things
we can touch
made us be
we are
this is very important to understand uh the biology
anchors the spirit we need to understand
this unconditional love will come to us at the moment
we achieve to transcend all the goals
purposes of the thymus
gland has two different tasks along ours the first one is from the very moment
we are being created in the womb of our mother until the uh
we become teenagers
the other one is from the from being teenager till uh to
till we are dead
the most important task of
gland is in the very first stage in the first stage of um of our growth
is related to the creation
gland the thymus has the goal to create the cells
we will call the immunological system
gland is the one
we can relate with the defense it defends us from the bacteria virus all the illnesses around from everything
can come inside
make us harm or try to kill us
gland
we speak about
clan we must to we must understand
the thymus is the one
protects protects the life takes us from everything
this is the first thing
we need to to get to understand the goal of
gland
the unconditional love one of the things
we need to to be aware of about
land is
in order to reach unconditional love we need to understand
this clan the one related to unconditional love is the one putting limits
conditions to our body
we don't get ill
we could be protected from the outside
this gland is the one
is protecting us constantly kind of the opposite to
is unconditional love
this is
in order to reach unconditional love we need to understand each part of the conditions
we have with them to understand the limitations
our body has set for ourselves helps us to understand our own limitations in the world
is
one of the first things
i was writing today sorry one of the things
i was writing today is
at the moment
we feel
someone or something is is going to to invade our body we usually make
position
gland the thymus is the one protecting the heart
that's
we do exactly the same
we want to protect ourselves
physically in biology
gland creates the immunological system
it is trying to protect us from the viruses
the bacteria uh
also energetically is the gland
is helping us to protect us from people from situations from things
we don't like
that
is
also
when we feel
someone is going to harm us we feel like something in the heart like like something a pressure pressure
a person received a lot of attacks from the outside
had a difficult life
we usually do is to protect
and to
your position start to to bend the shoulders like
and you go
protect
part
when some people uh have received some abuse uh from inside from some people or whatever they usually bend the body
and they start to feel like like closed
some of the some of the other positions is
you do like
because it's like the thymus is going to fight against something
it's people
wants to fight decision is also a bad thing
um it usually makes us believe
everything
come comes from the outside would harms us wants to kill us or whatever
we are waiting constantly for a fight one of the things
this place
um center represents two is the conflict of the lack of love
when you are not able to realize the strength of yourself
you don't recognize
you can protect yourself from anything uh is
you are not able to expand yourself to love yourself
is a conflict for a whole humanity
we as humanity has been had been facing the conflict of one another fighting each other
this is
we have
problem
it's like something from humanity not not from specific people picture
that along our whole life
the thymus has done for us was to try to get to us from the others from other people
thing
of the timers made us feel
we must fear others
we cannot trust the others
try to think about
that through all the history between nations countries families everyone uh was having fear of others
they were prostituting they they have no idea if they were able to trust the others
this is something
we anchor in the timeless start to have pre-judgments of the others
to separate myself from the others
picture
this is exactly the opposite to unconditional love
how do i achieve the unconditional love the way i achieve to get unconditional love is
i realize
everything
exists it's just a projection of myself whenever realized
everything
i have outside is just something i needed to understand
when i get to understand
set myself free from the judgment set myself free from the fear
when you set yourself free from fear suddenly you don't need to protect yourself from anyone
suddenly you accept the reality of everyone
you become you transform your conditions into unconditionally
is love love is the ability to transform yourself
if i am if i am able to transform myself by love i will also allow the others with no conditions to transform themselves without fear
that's
we call unconditionally unconditional love as you see
unconditional love is not just to love everything as equal unconditional love means
when i faced each one of my conditions inside i understand the projections
i had made outside
i allow myself to transform myself from those conditions
i set free the others from those conditions
i allow the others to transform themselves
that's unconditional love
the great mistake we have loved with the concept of love is
we think
love is to want
love is to allow to transform
is
it's
difficult to really love
to love is to allow the other person to transform itself not to become
i am expecting
person to be
i want the other person to be want allow two different concepts
both of them are love their love anyway
with consciousness love is to set free to allow something
we have inside of us is as humans is believe
to love others is to have others
in our history as humans we have fear to we are afraid to lose the others to lose other people
that's
we want to have other people to protect other people
the real love
is the most difficult thing to achieve is to set the other free free from everything watch the relation
it has with the timers i want to have the control of everything
the truth is the one
controls the immunological system
the defense system of our body
it must have control
in order to allow myself to love
be loved i need to relax the timelessness
lose the control relax low my defenses don't be afraid
this is
it's
difficult for humans
we had a story a history of trying to defend ourselves constantly from something
that's
when we say
the spiritual level says release the control they are not saying control they're talking about
control of course the mind has we used to believe
going is in the mind
of course
is
mostly the biological control is
in the times
this is
one of the tasks
we have for today is for today for any other day is to think about
is my posture my position
i see it try to look in
position your body used to see it if you sit like
like
like
and to activate it just with these two fingers i hit
so whenever you feel
you do it
along all
year we will have to work with unconditional love in order to do
to work with unconditional love we need to realize about our own limits conditions
everything we have
so i hope
is useful
let's go to
