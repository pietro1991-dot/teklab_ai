hi everyone um good morning good good evening good night promise good night welcome all of you to
beginning of the new month
is related to the constellation of vehicle
of course its potential is um its potential is um the the potential of the i am according to virgo is the um
i analyze along
whole month
we are going to try to do is to work in tiny things like uh more focused uh that's the kind of the idea of the whole month not to work with the bigger things
to the tiny
specific things
this is
when we work with
with the consciousness we usually work with philosophical philosophical aspects
take us into different
wide levels
are very open
and too many concepts
um for virgo
would be to just focus in the tiny things um the reason we are going to work with
through
month is
we are going to be with the virgo energy
means
we must put order to all our things
in order to work with with
what we have to do is to bring all
world of ideas
expressions into things into specific things
we could work specifically with each one of them maybe well it's going to be difficult for me
i don't have anything i don't have anything in virgo
well my rising is capricorn
kind of earthy
i don't know
is going to be very difficult for all the other signs of water air
fire we have to work with
anyway
one of the goals
we have through
year is try to uh put ourselves with coherence in the side
the perspective of each one of the other 12 parts
create us
one of the things
we did in the past the philosophy of ancient times was to realize
we are all made of 12 different energies 12 signs
that uh through our life we are supposed to we are supposed to be um to be in balance with all of them in order to be coherent we need to be in balance with every one of the 12
we all have them within
so
each one of us has activated more one than another
they said
in order to be in balance we need to put ourselves in the position
the perspective of each one of the twelve
in order to be in balance with each one of them
we have to do is to put ourselves in
position
to activate within ourselves some of the potentials
each one of these 12 have
we could um
we could appreciate with coherence all the creation
basically
we do is to to love unconditionally the whole process by accepting our point of view
also understanding the other point of view
putting myself in them
i can unconditionally understand every perspective
from the point of view of virgo
we have to do with
is to perceive the 12
say okay i will analyze each one of them
they have a positive of negative okay i will try to organize
positive
negative in physical aspects emotional aspects mental aspects
try to put
in a beautiful frame all organized by concepts
i can picture it
understand each one of them um of course
dude doing
for a sign of water
um
air
is like a slow slow suicide many of the spiritual people people are usually connected with water
air aspects of themselves
what they usually do is to say i rather i rather feel
perceive than just going to the mind i don't want to be in the mind
to be
analytic i just want to feel
i don't i don't want to write down anything
and to think like
but the problem is
if we are asking virgo people for example to meditate with us
to go into the imagination
it's natural
we may ask for some pisces people to to make a skim of ideas for sure you maybe would say
i am pisces
i am very organized
so on
yeah for sure it's not about the specific sign is
maybe you have the moon in virgo or the rising enviro who knows
that's
maybe you are more organized than other pisces
we are trying to do
is to talk about the big concepts okay not about the sign you are specifically
the big concepts the picture i know
for some people is very difficult
we usually believe
um we usually believe
um in
we have just to feel to perceive
that's it
it's not just about to feeling um feeling is a part of the process
there are much more
is um is to look into the tiny uh the step by step okay to understand the step by step of
we get into just feeling
picture
these two people
go to the beach
one of them is sensitive okay the person
is sensitive goes to the beach takes the sun smiles feels the breeze feels the water it feels like it like
person is the ocean moving around
it feels the touch of the sound
in the other hand we have
schematic person
finds the balance
and to
they
they feel relaxed by thinking uh by thinking for example in just one second
many seconds it takes for each one of the waves to break into the sand um
many suns would be in the sky if each one of the suns is like a uh like a grain of sand uh in in the beach um the light of the sun is not light is only weights of particles of photon particles
comes to me
go through my body
and i want to understand
it works etc
naturally
we would think is
the sensitive person goes to the spiritual path
the analytic person goes to the physical aspect okay um sorry the science aspect of the reality the scientific
these two perceptions are two
were always separated
that creates like a like a conflict in between our spiritual world
this happens
this fight happens
the sensitive people usually say i am from the heart
the other people the analytic people used to say i am from the mind
in the spiritual world we would call
consciousness racism
we always find people for sure in our lives
usually says you are you are too mental i don't like it you are too mental
the other ones would say you are too sensitive you live through your heart that's not right
we have these two different ways in
we usually say to live through the mind or to live through the heart picture
when we are working with um the coherence is not
one neither
one it's not the heart not the mind coherence is both of them
we have to do in the path of coherence is not to believe
the only way to connect to the universe is by feeling okay
you need to understand uh
the universe works in order to know
to handle the energy of the of the universe
create your reality fro through the heart or from the heart
in the other hand if you are too analytic
you are just thinking about the parts you will not be able to feel
you are understanding
we have to picture
and it will be more easy the sensitive people
lives through the heart usually see the reality as a whole a complete thing
they don't see the tiny parts
creates the whole thing
the schematic people they see each one of the parts by separate
they don't see the big picture they don't see the hole
to understand
this hole works you need to understand the tiny parts
creates the hole
in order to to give a meaning to each one of the parts you need to realize
those parts are part of the whole
this is
one of the things
we need to understand to get is a balance between both of them
basically
happened for example is imagine picture people a person
lives through the heart they will see the cosmos the whole universe
they will see
is
is wonderful
is amazing i am all
and the other one the analytic person will see stars the moon if it's equinox or sausteals they will think about all the stuff
they will miss the whole picture the meaning of all
the sensitive person will just feel losing the details
the analytic person will lose the meaning imagine
the person
lives from the heart can see the whole picture the cosmos the sky
feel it
in the other hand the analytic person can see the constellations virgo libra etc imagine picture
the people
is related through the heart can see
we are all connected
we are all one
in the other hand
you will see is
the analytic person will see the aspects of the personality of each one of the constellations
it can talk about each one of the constellations
it is
when we have to understand unconditional love none of them is unconditional okay
now we have to understand listen to
just to clarify myself if i if i say or describe or make a theater of something i'm not judging anyone specifically i'm just putting the character more more visible
we could picture okay
no offense okay usually the characteristic of a person
lives only from the heart usually it's these people
when you meet them
it's a very big group of people they go
just hacks everyone
says i love you
you are one with me
we are all together in
and i hug you
i love you brother sister
they don't even know the name they don't know who they are they don't know anyone um they they just have
uh ability to to give love to everyone even if they don't know them
they know we are all one
hey we are all one
on basically
is the one
the analytic person would call the hippie ones okay
usually if uh if an analytic person is in one of those meetings
when these hard people would hug them uh they would say don't touch me i don't know you i don't know who you who you are you don't even know my name we are separated right
so please air the analytic people are the ones
usually are in the same meeting
they look around
just in one tiny moment they think in each one of the persons
they are their characteristics
they would say uh
person is had a lack of money
person um had a problem with his dad
person for sure has um has been in a mental um uh institution
they start to analyze everything
they are dressing like
what way he has these shoes
start to understand um each one of them picture
that none of them is in balance one of them is in the heart
the other one is in the mind um
also you have in
kind of groups the people
is in the genitals the energy of the genitals
they go to those groups to see with
one they would sleep
but that's another another day
let's picture
heart
mind
we have in between
two chakras we have two chakras more third eye
throat chakra remember
here the throat the crown chakra is the mental is the one
is uh created through through beliefs okay
so it's constantly watching
looking for the beliefs
this is
it has a preconception of everyone
it's trying to look everyone from its own perception from its own belief in the other hand we have the heart
is on service
it's given given without expecting anything in between
crown chakra
is the schematic mind
the heart
is the open one we have the consciousness
the perception
the truth
is learning the process of learning
what we have to do is to change our perception
consciousness about our beliefs
are up
change the perception
learn about the other perceptions to be more open
process of the middle is the one
take us to coherence
what we have to do in order to change
to be coherent is to change the perception of my beliefs change my beliefs from who i believe i am
who i believe the others are
to open to understand the other people around
its differences
in order to get into
coherence
we have to do is to seat the lover one from the heart in front of the analytic person of the mind
they can talk
the heart would say hey we are all one we are all connected
we are all one
the analytic person the mental person would say maybe we are connected
we need to understand the role
each one of the 12 persons
are around
which is the role of each one of them of them in
specific moment
connection
are the characteristics
the uh
the potentials of each one of these 12
they could feel part of
unity
the people from the mind must understand
each one of them the 12 are part of a team
we call unity
the one from the heart needs to understand
in order for
team of unity to work it must respect the the characteristic characteristics of each one of the twelve each one of them will complement to each other to form like a chain in order to to it will work like
because each one of them each one of the twelve will work with its own energy
potential today i will i want to expand my explanation
it's the first day
i would like for you all to have
before um for the whole month the first thing
uh
the mental person would do is to arrive to the meeting
to organize the chairs in a circle
each one can see each other
separated in each one in each spot in
gathering
the mental one will organize the group
he knows the potential of each one of them
when he knows the potential of each one of them he will be able to seat the group in a proper position
each one assigns the other one has the potential to help the other one aside in order to exaggerate the example he will seat someone
doesn't know to write well
knows to speak very beautifully he will seat him aside of the other one
knows
to write very beautiful
doesn't
and know
to speak both of them will help each other
it will work it would be perfect okay
this person knew the potential of each one
that's
it worked
picture
example
the one
speaks very well
doesn't know
to write is a gemini person
it's gemini
he knows
to speak
to have a good speech
things too much
um his mind goes
fast
he cannot write properly
he sits as a side of a virgo person
this virgo person will write very specifically
perfect
he wouldn't talk at all
suddenly it comes our friend from the heart
is our lovely hippie okay imagine
this
guy
person
comes from the heart is the pisces one
just arrived late of course
he arrives late to the meeting
the spices
he just arrives
says hey brothers sisters i love you
much we are all one
and he hacks everyone that's the normal thing
a hard person would do
imagine
normally the pisces one would come
when he was trying to hack to hug the the eliminate person the gemini guy would say hey brother blah blah blah
not hack just the hand
maybe some weird way of saying hi
suddenly the pisces guy with no respect at all it goes
there to hack the virgo guy imagine
when
guy hacks the virgo guy
he is writing very properly suddenly without respect the pisces guy hugs him
suddenly uh the the virgo guy starts to feel like like uncomfortable with the situation um he didn't like
it was concentrated
after
during the whole meeting the vehicle guy felt uncomfortable
couldn't focus
help the gemini guy
he was
concerned about the hack
um
he couldn't keep going we have to picture
that sometimes
we say we are all one
we want to hug everyone some people doesn't feel fine
they they cannot relate with
same emotion
they can feel uncomfortable sometimes
we believe we are one we think
we all feel exactly the same imagine
that um the capricorn person
the one
organized the meeting of course is is capricorn
he was you know putting the time the organization
it's going to start
it's going to finish
are the goal of the meeting
do we want to do exactly all perfect
um
of course he would see
the spiciest person is uncomfortable is putting everyone uncomfortable
maybe the cancer person
of course the capricorn guy wouldn't say never anything to everybody
he would say to the leo guy um can you go
talk to everybody to to respect each other beyond the laughs
all the explanations um
we are trying to understand
is
neither one or the other are the right thing the mental person the mind person
this person would say would would organize everything according to its own belief
it would organize the structure of everything just by saying okay
has a skill
matches with with
skill
that's it
one with
one
one with
one
had no idea
they all are part of a team they put he put everyone to work with the specifics
had no idea
to work as a team the guy of pisces comes
suddenly he thinks
we are all a team
but he thinks
we are such a team
we needs to get fun to enjoy the meeting
he forgets
the meeting was just
okay
we have to acknowledge about
is for example
the pisces guy
came
wanted to hire everyone if he would know about the personality of each one with the same love he would come to the virgo guy i would just give him the hand not a hug just hi nice to see you
and the
to the gemini guy he would speak
talk very very happy of being all together
not invading their its space the capricorn guy the mental one must understand
they are all
working for a goal
that goal is to be in service with love
the pisces guy is the one
will show them
they are
in
meeting
is
it's not about to be all separated
divided working in each of its own neither to be all connected
just one in chaos the goal to understand all
is to picture
we have a goal a purpose
is to be all working for the transformation of the consciousness of a whole
if we don't just concentrate ourselves in the difference between each other
the potentials of each one we would not really um get to do the purpose
we don't understand the parts
creates the purpose
this is
it's
important to respect the differences to achieve the whole
this is
the people
are feeling the whole thing must understand
learn the tiny things
this is
the persons
just see the tiny things must to understand the essence
the purpose of all of them together
this is
we are trying to do
the reason
we are explaining
is
if we don't understand step by step part by part of ourselves we cannot understand the purpose of the whole
we are in another way we can understand
when we say i am a whole i can feel everything inside of me
this is like saying it doesn't matter if i have my third eye in the genitals my sacrum in the throat it doesn't matter
it's all one
no
in order to feel the one those must be in order in order to be in balance
we have to understand is to study
realize the potential of each one of the chakras
they are in
order
one of them must be in one spot
the other
they are helping each other
they interact
to take care of them
to nourish them each one of them
that's
it starts to work the whole otherwise i would say i am a perfect hole
inside is a mess
this is
usually happens to us
we give everything to the spiritual idea in order to try to feel the cosmos we precisely do the opposite to the cosmos we create chaos
cosmos in greek means order
this is
if we are not in order we will never reach to feel the cosmos
with
we initiate the month of virgo i i was saying uh i was saying
sorry for
hour
um
anyway
is free
is no you didn't have to pay for
so i speak whatever i want
after we set all
let's go to
i was looking into the notebook like reading something
i didn't wrote anything it was all blank today we are related with the crown chakra today uh we work with the crown chakra
is the beliefs okay in the mental aspect we will work with the beliefs
let's do it very virgo
um crown chakra mind level order beliefs we work with the beliefs today
we have the negative
the positive beliefs we ended the month of i can we are in the month of i analyze first of all
is a belief
to believe means to have faith
some
something is going to happen to believe is the first one
is think or have faith
something will happen
the belief the belief means
you um means the constancy or the yeah the constancy of thinking
something may happen
something will happen
a belief is something
we inherit from one generation to another something
that we expect for it to happen from many generations through time the belief is to expect for something to happen
we must wait for a long time
it goes through many generations
the belief is to expect for something to happen or to think
that thing will happen only in the way
i expected is to hope or wait for something to happen or to wait for something to happen as i hope for it to happen
we are constantly we are all created by beliefs we are all made of beliefs
everything
we do in our lives is expecting for something to happen
these beliefs can be helpful in order to give us tools to accomplish our missions to push us forward or they also can give us fear
to hold us back
we don't die in the intent of making stuff i believe can be something expensive or something
limits you
we could maybe think
the negative are the beliefs
limit ourselves
the positive are the ones
expand ourselves
these beliefs were inherited by our family
friends
society around us
i will point to
is not related with any trauma
any disease it is only related with thoughts ideas for example they believe talking about the issues
we have in the world today we maybe can have a belief
is
there are different races
the races are uh some of them are superior than others that's a belief some of the examples for for example we could maybe for sure you you have heard uh the belief
is uh the only way you will reach your goals is by sacrifice um you have to work hard to get
you want those are beliefs
i will i will use my grandfather as an example um as an example for
i'm using my grandfather a lot
he's still in the fourth dimension trapped
i am talking about him
i'm trying to help him
until he is
i will try to use it as an example sorry rampa he he gave me two beliefs
were very heavy okay
i will try to picture those heavy um heavy beliefs
he gave to me
my grandfather for example um
i was seven years old
younger he used to uh read a in a in a news
um no magazine in a magazine he used to um to read a lot about answers of many things answers of the universe the cosmos
in a scientific way
um i never read them i was just
but his interest in those issues was something
i inherit
i want to explain stuff also with science things to be more clear
i believe
i have is
i have to seek for the answers
for sure i don't have all the answers i don't have all the answers
i need to look
look for more answers in order to understand
i'm doubting constantly of myself
the belief is
i don't have the answers
always
is someone
knows better than me
for me it's a good belief
i inherit from him
because it doesn't for me doesn't it it is it is good for me to know
i don't have all the answers
i know
i have all the answers within
i love to know
there are more answers
i may don't know
i love to reach for more to learn more
is
for me it's a good belief
even if i have the answers i love to search for more options
is
it's a good belief
even if i know
that i have the truth within it's a good belief
helps me to reach for more to nourish myself in different perspectives
then is the other one the negative
is the racism the bad belief
i inherit from him was the racism
to picture the idea in 1945
the second world war ended uh a lot of people from germany they went to live in argentina
they um they were nazis
uh my grandfather was a child in
moment
he grew up with them
he took his friends beliefs he wanted to be like his friends
this makes you believe
limits you
it makes you believe
only your race has the truth
all the answers
you were looking for it's in only one race
it creates an idea
there is only one race
has much more answers
limits me
you realize
this takes you the power it makes you think
it's just one tiny thing
it really is bigger
sometimes we may believe
we don't have any negative beliefs
um we are made of negative beliefs it limits
it we have to think about
are our our own limitations
this is not about to to show to others
you uh
you are doing it great
is for you the worst thing things must come
this is to be completely sincere with yourself about
are your limitations
we are going to uh to understand is
even if you don't come up with many positives or many negatives
maybe you have one in one side
20 in the other one it doesn't matter you just write it down meditate on each one of them
we have to do with
is not to try to understand
to solve our belief
we have to try to do is to write down every one of the beliefs without thinking meditate on them means to realize
i have them
try to think about from
they come from
uh don't try to solve them we are in the vehicle energy is not about to solve it's about to realize
do i have
this is about to analyze it's not about to solve is to write it down
try to think
comes from
yes i think
i believe
i feel
it started in
moment recognize analyze
just picture
that the beliefs is like a dead body okay a dead body you are not going to make him alive to heal it nothing you are doing an autopsy an autopsy of
corpse okay just
why did
person die not
do i heal them okay
um the meditation we are going to do it will take only five minutes
that's
i spoke
much
the only thing
we are going to do
is balance
information inside
um
we are going to do um is to deliver myself these beliefs
um
energy from the spirit uh with the sound na
the statement of today na is i am the heavens a misery
is the one
brings towards me the information of the heaven the code
we are going to work
we have in mind today is fa sharp or soul flat
is the note
unites in the chromatic scales denotes fa notes fa
soul in the saxon music notations we find it as f sharp um or g flat one of the most known bridges for being the vibration
connects with the heart chakra
thus with the balance of all forces given
receiving the expansion of love precisely
we has been spoke speaking today f sharp
is the heart
the beliefs
is the mind
we are going to work today today we change the music
each month we will do different music
thank you gize for doing
music remember we are in hulsu
means the second cycle we are in the second month
after
tiny meditation alignment we can take a moment to write down some of our beliefs we are going to do
every day
maybe if you want to wait for
the alignment to do the the writings
it's good i can tell
we started with the mind
today was mind as always i massage the body i thank the body for being the anchor of the spirit in mata
i do
by stretching caressing each part of it i relax the body i focus in my breathing i focus my attention on the air the oxygen coming through my nose towards my lungs my heart blood organs
muscles i feel the heat within my body as i take a deep breath i feel
heat going out through my skin filling up my aura
all my magnetical feel i recognize the energy
is within
outside of my body
i take all
energy to the top of my head in my crown as i take deep breaths i see imagine all the energy around my body flowing to my crown irradiating as a sun above my head i recognize
it is in
spot
all my beliefs negative
positive are anchored they are created
i recognize
my beliefs are the filter between my i am the spirit with my soul
body
at the time
this divine presence wants to get inside my body it first must go through the filter of my beliefs as my beliefs are very limited the less my i am would be able to come
activate itself within me
they act as a dumb
stop the flow of energy of the essence as more expanded my beliefs are the most deep the i am will get inside my body i recognize
my spirit the i am is the messenger the emissary of the heavens trying to go through my beliefs to get inside my body
is
i have to acknowledge each one of my beliefs
order them
the i am can't get inside of me i start to pronounce the vibration as i feel
this belief starts to be organized as a crown in a circle
i recognize
i am the heavens emissary i am the heavens emissary i am the emissary of heaven i take my hands to my heart take a deep breath i recognize i am the heavens emissary
my beliefs are the door to earth as i recognize my beliefs i am able to open the doors of heaven on earth
take the breath
start to spread
consciousness from your heart towards all the body by stretching massaging yawning
and i come back
now open my eyes
now
we have
information anchored in our energy um we can go to write it down
to work thank you for being
for the patience
for i'll set yourself to work with your inner self rest a lot
see you tomorrow for the third eye
