foreign hi everyone good morning good evening good night I hope
finds you well we meet again another day to work with the throat chakra
I uh first I wanted to share some stuff
of course for all of you
are constantly watching these videos you may say I um you you already said
or whatever
I guess it's important for the people
is joining us
new people um to know some stuff
first of all I just wanted to remind remind you
I am doing all
in Spanish
English
this information is being um day by day
there's no time to make translations there's no time to make subtitles
also
of the speed of the information I want to share it with my own vibration with the vibration
I am trying to give
information
the reason I am just doing
in English
Spanish is
these two languages are the most spread languages in the world of course if we would be speaking about amount of population um who I could be uh talking to I would have to speak in Hindi or Chinese of course
um it's not about
it's about
many people is talking these languages all around the world
of course I would I I would be able to explain all
uh in other languages
I know to speak like Italian Portuguese
and Catalan maybe
of course uh those are a tiny amount of um of people
so most of them can understand Spanish or no English
another thing I wanted to share is
this is a word for the whole year
we are doing day by day
if you are not being able to do
it doesn't matter you don't have to do day by day to make it properly you can do it whenever you want whenever you can as your being is allowing you to do it okay
in the other side something I would like to to find
that we are in the throat chakra talking about the truth
the other thing
I wanted to share is
what I am sharing daily
is not
I remember from other lives is not my memories from other times is the information
I know
I feel from my higher self higher self
my own self
I wanted to say with
is
this is not a path for you to believe in
I say is a path for you to start to believe in
you are okay
um just wanted to say
that I don't want you to believe
we are all doing
because I have the truth
I am sharing the truth no is
is my truth
I am sharing step by step
I am acknowledging of my truth
you could find your own truth okay I wanted to tell
so all of you who know
what we are doing uh could explain
in the same way okay
there is something else I wrote I I I read today I read today sorry um something
I guess
many of the people in
kind of path would have also these kind of questions
the question was
can you know
what I am explaining to you is not used or created by Darkness
dark beings okay like
um
is some issue
we are going to discuss in Scorpio okay of course the darkness
the the answer would be maybe yes maybe no I am not the one able to tell you
no that's not true or yes it's true
how
can we know
I am not being manipulated by Darkness that's an issue to discuss well I guess
the only way you can know
is by actions
coherence
something
I would like to say is
um I I have never been against Darkness never
I have no problem to say
something
I would say is
the people
blame Darkness for all the evil
human has it's irresponsible it will always say
because
is not to be responsible of Our Own dissonance
to blame someone I just wanted to talk about
because we are in the truth
I am not who can say I am working for light or I'm working in darkness
is something I cannot say
is something you must recognized by resonance by awareness
that's it
we have nothing else to do
to keep going
of course we will talk a lot more about
in November
we're going to work with um in in the throat chakra today is the expression okay
is the way in
this chakra moves the energy of emotion
the thing was
I it went away
I'm I just um I just acknowledge something
I said oh yes I know
what it is
suddenly
I saw
I saw another thing from
aspect
I said like oh I forgot about
so I have it went back
don't worry
do you have by
you received by working yourself every day
for those who hadn't read the book The Blog I would like to explain
expression means the origin of the word is expression is X
is the word to go out or to go beyond X gives the the origin to the world um to the word uh exit in English Okay for example exit to go out
expression impression okay the pressure of something
we today naturally we we say culturally today we would say
that for example artistic expression we would say um um natural expression as is something creative
expression is not specifically
expression means to um set free
you have pressed inside like with a lot of oppression inside you have to capture
um the opposite of expression
is to set
free to set expression free is to repress
repress the word re comes from the last
means to go back to
to go back to depression to put pressure
let's imagine
that uh for example you have like um like a string like a wire um of metal okay
you just make pressure on it
it starts to end
as much pressure I put the much it starts to bend okay
when I am like
this uh stream
wire would be like
okay
does remember to you
pressure
this shape is the high frequency the high vibration if we generate
pressure into
vibration
we have inside locked in a body okay
this body is
close
the vibration starts to spread
every time is more
more
more High vibration
suddenly it tries to explode
the reason
so the place
all
pressure comes through is the voice is the throat
this spot
is the one
was designed by nature to express the operation
I have Within
all the pressure the pressure
we have within is um is setting is free through the throat
this um structure was created to talk to express to to sing okay if I have
tool to set
vibration out
what I am doing instead of doing
and I shut my mouth I don't speak I don't say
all
Energy starts to be compressed
starts to be repressed foreign
vibration
I have inside is impressed in me it's in print in me
print it
okay
it's impressed imprinted in me
what I have within is trying to express through me okay
energy tries to express through me
if I shut up
I do is to re-press
vibration do you follow all the concepts for example If instead of me shutting up is someone else is someone else saying shut up the word is to put pressure on me
that you may say oppression to oppress someone hmm
just picture
that all these words are talking about talking about depression the pressure of something
now realizing about uh
expression doesn't means to create something
expression means to set free attention
I have inside we can understand the next step I hope uh
it's better
now we understand what's the meaning of expression
is not creation
is to set for 10.
this would mean
um
that helps us to understand
everything
we are everything
we are is basically basically vibration
everything
we perceive everything
we feel okay is um is vibration constantly
emotional vibrations feelings are very vibrations everything
we are is a vibration if you hear me well the rest doesn't matter if I understand I am constant vibration
now I can picture
every pulse
comes from outside
every pulse
I emit from inside will be vibration moving around
interacting each other with the environment hmm constantements or no
this movement is happening even if we want it or we don't want it it's natural
some
happened is
in
interaction of the vibrations my nervous system interpret interpretates
this uh some of
vibration made me feel uncomfortable or maybe like um uh confused okay
normally the neurological system is designed to survive
anything
makes me feel uncomfortable is something
can kill me that's
the brain
the um
the um the neurons the nervous system is trying to to picture
okay if if
person is insecure maybe he's going to die foreign the system the the nervous system doesn't think about oh maybe he's feeling
because of
and
no the first thing
it does is to think we're gonna die we could say
by all biological bodies is hypocondric
what the nervous system was designed for was to protect me
I could keep being alive
anything
can
can come from outside is taken as a virus
this is
the system shut one of the main things
this system does in order to shut down
not to allow anything to come inside is to start to purge all the points through
the information can come inside the first thing
the body does is to shut up shut down the nose
the mouth
these two are the ones
bring all the information from the outside towards the lungs
the heart
so the blood
everywhere
what does the body it shut the shut the the throat you you feel like
is shutting closing
Knots you say knots in the nose
what we usually do to cough or to sneak sneeze you say yeah sneeze to take everything out of
it can come to me
do me bad
for example
we are in a in a weird situation we usually use the expression
smells bad there's something rotten
this smells bad your tongue is feeling like I don't want to eat anything
um yeah these things
also with the tongue
you feel the tongue like like you don't want to eat anything it's like um um I don't know the word in English to say it I don't know if in English you said it
it's like uh
Spanish used to say
this tastes bad um in a bad situation okay disgusting it's a disgusting situation gusts
another thing
actually do is
we see
we perceive the world from the outside weirdly
something
kind of makes us bad
feel bad Within
the body does is in order to take outside everything from the Mind Christ
to cry is a normal reaction to take everything outside
all
sector
knows eyes
mouth with the throat are the places
the body shut the information
nothing can come inside
anything
I have
that is from outside tries to take it away
these
usually happens quickly it also happens energetically
emotionally
what we do emotionally is
everything
usually is expressed through me it repressed in
this is
this Circuit of energy
we used to talk with the environment shut down
it's repressed
happened is the emotional immunological system trying to defend ourselves something in the outside
maybe could be bad or good we don't know
we just shut up
one of the main things
we do is to deny to see their reality to shut up close your mouth
not to say anything to lose the ability to smell uncomfortable situations
we uh um
we do is to shut up the doors
we have to communicate with the outer world
for example um everything
people could know
we are happy or sad or mad is through
triangle in the face
part
so
we have problems
in
part of the face it's about things
I am trying to repress
we have to acknowledge
this is the way in
what
is talking about is about
I am relating myself with environment with the world
this is
we have to identify
am I expressing
the others see myself expressing if I am repressing or oppressing
expression is about to allow
energy
diversion
I have within to express itself towards the outside
this is
I have to acknowledge
do we Express in the world
phase we put every day in the world
um
emotions we shut up okay all
is everything
comes from
so
is the the task for today is
is the way in
I express in my life or in the other hand do I express in my life
are people
maybe Express themselves better
they are mad
are people
Express themselves better
they are sad many different ways or just in silence they spread much better
try to recognize
is your way to express usually sometimes you would say I express with art or by writing or something like
but usually artists are the ones with the worst expression problems
emotional problems
usually artists
they do is to change the focus to something
is not the main problem
they put all
energy into art
they are not facing
is
we usually make a mistake by comparing the artistic expression with a real expression
why do we have to look again in the way we communicate with the outside
in
communication with the others I can teach my immunological system
not everything
comes from the outside is going to kill me
each one will find it's a to find it to find a way to calibrate
but
the important thing is to realize
do I do it
how am I working with
in
time the present
remember
we are not
to solve the problem in
month we are
to analyze the problem let's go step by step today the vibration we are going to use is hey it's not fair is Fe the statement is I am the spark of clarity
the code of today is the pattern each one of
Consciousness has the Insignia of a vibration a name they are all identified with sounds in different frequencies
originate intentions the verb the Creator word the voice is the instrument of creation the communication between the parts of the cosmos maintains the order
way the L is the pattern of the ex Express expressible word manifest manifestation
let's go to do the calibration
as always we start stretching the body yawning
caressing the body foreign as I relaxed the body with my imagination I start to bring the oxygen through my nose lungs heart blood organs
muscles foreign the heat within my body
how it goes through my skin towards all the directions foreign the great ocean of vibration motions around me I feel the calm of
ocean around me the water
pressed my body foreign myself to feel the waves the water moving my body side to side very Softly take a deep breath
I observe above me over the water the light of the Sun of the I am with each breath start to go up
feel the limit of the water touching head think of your head as an island emerging from the ocean
slowly feel the limit of the water go down the body as you go up with every breath no the water its limit in my eyebrows my eyes going down to my ears nose the water coming down as I go up through my leaves my going down I feel all my head outside the water feeling
my neck is coming out until it all is over let's see I feel the heat of the Sun
it's light on me I feel
it dries my face my head my hair on my neck I inspire breathe in the air
is above the sea
I recognize
is my voice from the throat
moves the waves
vibrates bringing the sound towards each one of the oceans I recognize
this is the Sea of my expression
that only my voice can bring calm
clarity to
ocean take a deep breath as you allow the light of the Ayan to come inside your body through your crown your third eye
shine in your throat
when you start to make the sound you will Express
light
consciousness of the I am with its clarity bringing calm to your ocean foreign I keep pronouncing the sound a side keep pronouncing the sound I recognize
it's my expression
set free from the tension all
ocean of creation I feel the light of the I am as a spark bringing clarity to all expressions realizing
are my expressions bringing Consciousness
clarity to
I am take a deep breath I recognize I am the spark of clarity I am the spark of clarity I am
part of clarity foreign s to my heart I'd become aware
all
vibration
I have inside is waiting for the moment to go out to say the truth to express the truth of who I really am I realize
is the fear of being harmed fear of being alone those
are not allowing me to express the fear
repress
I am
I reckon
I am the only one capable to Enlighten
park to bring clarity to express
show the truth of who I am I am the spark of clarity I am the spark of clarity I am the spark Authority take a deep breath foreign set free from the heart all the sounds
I have inside waiting to be said
expressed right
foreign
Consciousness all over my body by caressing it stretching
yawning
each one at its own time come back
and
opening your eyes
remember
the task for today is to write down from
I express in my life
the second task would be just to express even if I am alone to say everything
I hadn't said in my life
I shut up
drink a lot of water
rest a lot
see you tomorrow at the same time for the heart
