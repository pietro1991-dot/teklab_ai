usually every uh totally date we connect 
um 
online with them to to be together 
connected uh this time we are all here 
together and we 
wear it to the pyramid to one of the 
pyramids today 
so 
we have been connecting the toroid 
physically so that's why i wanted to 
start today with the alignment that we 
are all together here i we will start by 
alignment first and then i will start 
explaining 
about um 
tomorrow 
i don't have battery so 
so i don't have um 
i don't have the 
music 
so um 
today we have been in sakara 
and um 
in the pyramids of sakara and we were 
all together 
there and um 
it's been um 
it's been 
uh 
really powerful and uh but we 
we just came from cicada so we didn't 
have the time to really 
share and to understand what what 
happened there so i will 
i will explain you and and share 
and share 
with you 
uh tomorrow when we finished 
um 
so 
today we were in sakara pyramid 
uh and sakara pyramid is was 
that was meant to be the place to 
activate the protector the cube so 
we 
download or activated all the frequency 
of the different elements uh from north 
to south time and space we connect them 
all to the void and from the void we 
expanded to the heart of each one of the 
people present there so 
now in a few hours just a few hours um 
we will go to the things to 
uh to the things to 
to activate the 
uh this information and then to spread 
it into the entire network 
um 
uh 
through the great pyramid of cubes 
so 
all of that as a preparation to go then 
to 
uh to aburab for the alignment uh in 
during the eclipse and remember that the 
eclipse tomorrow 
uh 
makes a new beginning for our i am path 
because it will be the season in between 
the eclipse 
uh until 
um 
till december 4th 
which is the path of the kundalini of 
the planet so 
the path of dragon 
so tomorrow begins a new 
path 
a new way or energy for the path 
let's do this all together connecting 
so 
we can prepare 
all of us as one 
for tomorrow 
we sit comfortable close our eyes 
and concentrate in our breathings 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
my 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
i become aware 
of my physical body 
[Music] 
honoring it 
[Music] 
here and now 
[Music] 
becoming aware of this body that i 
inhabited 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
i bring my attention to my feet 
it's going up 
to my legs 
[Music] 
waste 
all the back 
shoulders 
arms 
hands 
i relocate 
my body moving it softly 
so i move softly my head in circles 
until i find my axis 
[Music] 
so 
[Music] 
[Music] 
i imagine 
that i have 
a mirror in front of me 
[Music] 
and i can see myself in the reflection 
from the feet 
to the head 
[Music] 
through the legs 
the chest hands and arms 
till i can see myself 
staring 
[Music] 
watching straight to my eyes 
[Music] 
[Music] 
as i stare to my reflection 
i position 
myself 
as the one 
that is 
[Music] 
i recognize me 
the verb to be 
[Music] 
and in my reflection 
i can see 
all the things 
that can tell about myself 
not to be 
the void 
from this side 
i am everything 
from the other side 
i am nothing 
[Music] 
and i recognize 
that being everything doesn't allow me 
to create new things 
and i can only express a new 
being 
in my life 
a new way of being 
through the void 
of not being 
becoming aware of this 
i connect myself to the heart of my 
reflection 
and i spit in infinite spiral 
of be and not to be 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
i use my hands if 
i need them 
to connect from heart to heart 
to the reflection 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
i connect from heart to heart 
what i am 
and all the things that i am not 
[Applause] 
in order to allow me 
to become something new 
in a new reality 
in a transcendental 
existence 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
and i recognize these two forces 
the sun and the moon 
[Applause] 
i am the sun 
irrigating light 
being reflected 
on the moon 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
from between my darkness 
and my light i am able to create a new 
back 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
as i breathe 
i imagine this 
infinite spiral 
expanding throughout all my body 
from my feet to my head 
expanding the information of 
the i am 
and all the things that i am not 
creating the possibilities to become 
something new 
[Music] 
and from north to south 
from below my feet 
and upon my head 
[Music] 
i imagine this spiral creating a torus 
that surrounds my entire body 
and also 
my own reflection 
and i take a deep breath expanding 
histories 
unifying 
this 
center with all 
the others around 
[Music] 
as a unique taurus 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
and i expand the vibration throughout 
the spiral 
[Music] 
[Music] 
soon 
[Music] 
see 
so 
[Music] 
[Music] 
so 
[Music] 
[Music] 
soon 
[Music] 
um 
[Music] 
i am 
the eternal spiral 
i am the inspired 
eternal spiral 
[Music] 
i am the eternal spiral 
[Music] 
i think 
i think 
[Music] 
[Music] 
[Music] 
oh 
[Music] 
take your breath 
[Music] 
[Applause] 
[Music] 
and each one at its own time 
start to come back 
here and now 
stretching and yawning 
[Music]

[Applause]
