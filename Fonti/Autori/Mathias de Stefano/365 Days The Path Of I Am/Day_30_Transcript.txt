sorry i'm trying to put the hair
what we are trying to do is to not to follow the astrological calendar
we are doing is to follow the atlantean calendar

year was useful for you
that you could take some benefits to work with yourself
to acknowledge more stuff from you
from the universe
we have to remember
uh the concept of
month was to recognize the greatness of the i am
to recognize
i can't be
i am
this is
we had to to work with
many concepts of the greatness of the universe
from
i am thinking
perceiving of tomorrow is
this next month won't be about the greatness of the concepts of the universe
for most specific things
we are going to the month of virgo we have to recognize for for sure
those
knows a bit of astrology
the energy of virgo will take us to think about the specific
tiny things of ourselves not the universal things just the tiny things
to put order into those tiny things
the tiny details of life
let's see
the virgo energy will bring us tomorrow
i would just recommend something for tomorrow
for the whole month related to virgo we are not going to think about the greatness of the universe
we are going to go to the details
from tomorrow
i suggest is for you to have a notebook paper one a notebook with a pen or a pencil always assigns you okay

maybe maybe the last day of the month i will i will make you an exam um okay that's very bigger okay
so maybe you will have an exam of yourself
i remind you
um
we uh
i wrote today about plenitude or fullness as you want to call it
i wrote about
concept
i would like to just talk about
a little bit
plenitude or um fullness is i wrote about
today
it's like the one
wraps up everything
we have worked in
month talking a little bit about
concept of planitude
we have to know is
this whole month was about to well
each one of the months we are going to go ahead um it was about to put together the three concepts
are the mental the emotional
physical the spirit the soul
the body all together as one
plenitude comes from the word in latin
means complete to complete stuff all the things
were separated to put them together
complete them basically
we were supposed to do by putting all these concepts together is to recognize
coherence
yeah the coherence of these three aspects together they create the the feeling
you are full
you feel full yourself you fulfill your goals you fulfill everything within you
you feel plenty the concept of of plenitude
i was talking about today is about to recognize
the only way in
i will reach the or achieve enlightenment
clarity is not by going to the spirit is by acknowledging
the spirit the soul
the body are won
lived together
the concept of feeling plenty is to live fully inside my body
and
this is a very heavy statement for many of the people
are working with spirituality
we have been created in our lives
conditioned in our lives to believe
in our seek of the spirituality of enlightenment we designed our path trying to find the freedom to go to the spirit to get enlightenment to go outside to change the dimension to go into another dimension to another world to another star
we used to believe
we need to leave
to go away from
in order to find enlightenment
to feel full
pursuit of enlightenment has made it believed has made a belief
we are trapped
in a physical body in a physical aspect
we have to set ourselves free from the physical world
in reality the body is just another expression an aspect of the spirit
is something
pushes to change even the way in
we refer to our body
the spirit
one of the things for example we would say to ascend into another dimension
what we have to do is to open ourselves to perceive other dimension
a being doesn't change
go from one dimension to another a being just expressed changed its perception of different perspectives of dimensions
in reality each one of us is living in every dimension the spirit is not inside the body it's an aspect of the body the being
we call the higher self is not a superior being is just am is the verb of to be
every every projection we do into the outside is just the reflection of the inside
everything
we call spirit is not something external it's just the vibration
makes us exist
it's not
going outside the body we reach the enlightenment is totally the opposite is
you live fully present in your body you reach to enlighten yourself
to live in plenitude is to put the parts together is to unite the body the spirit the soul everything
was separated in one that's the concept of plenitude
that's the thing
we feel
i live
and
so we have to also remember uh
living
and
is not the present is the plenitude of the three times past present
future together the eternity
is
one of the most important things
we need to accomplish in our lives is to enjoy the creation the creation is not a jail a in
you have been trapped
you have to escape from
reality to get into the spirit
you have to realize is
the spirit has created
so everything
you live is the creation of an artist
we call the spirit
this spirit would be trying to escape from its own art
we have to acknowledge
the reason
we feel pain
suffering is just
we are not living plantly in
life we are always trying to escape from something
i know
these are difficult concepts
it usually breaks with our structure it breaks the concept the pre-concept preconception of
we believe is the spiritual path
as an example we can just think about a person like francis from aziz francesco de assisi
he could see the most beautiful light
the most dirty
darkness darkest reality i want to remember you all all those who are working for your own path of enlightenment
to connect with the i am
in order to do
in
last day of the physical body we need to remember
the only way to connect with i am is to live fully present in our body
the body is just the projection the external
most wide open expression of our soul
our spirit
i i used to say
that is very difficult
usually the people
is spiritual thinks
what is good is to feel fine
what is fine is everything
is celestial
invisible sorry i was trying to explain something
suddenly i lost the wi-fi um i'm just in blank everything went away it was about to say the most important
suddenly it went away um it will come i am i'm living
fully in the present
um
when i'm speaking i'm not i'm not thinking about
i'm saying i'm just expressing
i feel
suddenly
i don't feel anything i don't have anything to say
but it's weird
i was about to say something maybe it was not
important for the next for the next month maybe
let's read the information of today
we don't lose time
maybe it will come up
the vibration of today is simply like okay
the statement for today is i am the eternal path
is related with s
is the path
the h
is like the sound related to the eternity
that's
i am the eternal path
the code for today the information is the note
is f
it says family tuarum
means these servants of yours jacob's poem continues naming all the servants of the creator those who watch his wonders the alphabetic position for the pha note is f
and occupies uh the fourth place in the diatonic scale of c major at the same time following the scale of vibration of the being occupies the place of the plexus chakra being
way the note
calibrates the being
and all its bounds emotions
unifying the webs
creates us
that
we create everything is connected
let's start doing massages stretching yawning i thanks the spirit for being the anchor
i thank the body for being the anchor of the spirit in the matter
i relax the body taking deep breath i become aware of my breathing my body take deep breath

how it goes outside through the skin filling up the aura
all the magnetical feel realizing
this heat is the strength of the spirit
is within me i feel
energy coming out of my body becoming the energy of the soul in the emotional level
the spirit in the mental level i see
feel the fresh light of the soul coming from the moon my own moon
i feel the heat the warm light of the spirit shining like the sun all over my skin all the energy
is within me shines outside of me
i recognize myself as the temple of
soul
this spirit take a deep breath
be aware of each tiny part of your body of your own temple wow i become aware
honor my temple my body the physical expression of my soul
spirit my own self take a moment to think
do you see your body do you like your body do you accept your body do you judge your body try to feel to think if you accept your own body
take a deep breath breathe in
i will allow the energy of the i am to express itself inside my body to show me the potential of my own body
the beauty of its own natural biology take a deep breath
start to bring the energy the light of the spirit
the soul inside your own body feeling it going through the cupola in the crown through the roses the windows of your eyes towards the candles going down to the bells of your throat the sacristy in your heart the altar the plexus the hole
the choir in the sacrum the portal in the genitals the two paths in the knees
the horizon between heaven
earth in your feet feel the light of the i am shining inside your own body
showing the marvelous biology
is trying to keep you alive constantly in balance homostasis every molecule cell organ
is working expressing its own beauty to inner cosmos try to carry the tips of your fingers your hands softly fill in the skin the touch sensations
perceive the wonders of the microcosms
each cell is perfect shining the best of its potential trying to replicate the beauty of the universe in your temple in your own body they doesn't see the whole
they do everything for it to exist beyond
i see with my eyes of my body i allow me to feel
a cell could see the body watching all all the wonderful things
she was able to create to express as perfection take a side on yourself
now go deep within perceiving the molecules
compose
forms the cell
inside of them very tiny the atoms
between the atoms in
space you feel the waves
liberations
in
vibration you can perceive the spirit the essence consciousness
i allow myself to expand the spirit from the waves to the atoms to the molecules the cell every cell every organ through my skin towards the magnetical field around me as i express i say to myself i can leave the spirit in my body i can't express my soul in my body i can't live plantly in my body as i pronounce the sound i start to express around all the light of the spirit from every atom of my body i allow myself to feel the sensation through all my body through all my skin as i pronounce the vibration i allow myself to feel
in
expression of the sound i feel the spirit the perfection expressing itself from every cell i feel the perception the perfection of my matter of my body for i am the spirit expressed in a body
i recognize like
that my body is the path to eternity i am the eternal path i am the eternal path i am the eternal path take a deep breath i take my hands to my heart to balance i can't live plantly in my body i become fully aware
my body is an eternal expression of the spirit a fractal expressed from the eternity of my soul
