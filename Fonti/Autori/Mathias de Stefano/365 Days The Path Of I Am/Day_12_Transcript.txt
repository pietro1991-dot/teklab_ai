hi everyone good morning good evening good night i hope everyone has had a good day
we are going to integrate
today we're gonna use all
energy
these emotions to activate um the third eye remember
we are
to work with the coherence of the being
let's remember
in order to be coherent coherent uh
we have to do is to accept
see the parts
we have in our shadows
also in our lives
we are not going to judge anything
we feel or
helps we are just going to integrate it okay i was reading uh a comment
was asking is it possible
maybe um we are starting to feel uh
we are all connected doing
every day we are starting to feel
happens to um
happens to everybody like everybody is feeling mostly the same
what do i do with
i don't want to feel
they were asking
here's the the answer
the answer to
question is of course
that is happening
we start to feel mostly um
other people is feeling
not
they are other people
because we are balancing own energies
you have to imagine
we humans are like um like tuning forks
all these tuning forks um are vibrating different synthesis
imagine
each one of us is like constantly moving like
and suddenly
we start to make the balance since every day the alignments every day
movement starts to balance to find the balance until it starts to move in harmony okay
this is normal
we uh
we are working with the coherence
this is not about being coherent
is also being coherent in the network
this is
we build a network
um
we don't have to be afraid of being like um
if i am feeling something
is not mine every emotion is within you everything
you feel is okay
what we are doing by feeling the emotions of the network is like trying to balance in the case of
is one
move like harder
the other ones helps it to reach the balance again okay
is part of
it is to be in the symphony towards a planetary consciousness as i can feel sometimes the lower vibration
i feel in the network i can also be pushed to the vibration if the whole network is connected to reach the enlightenment or high vibration
good
um one of the things
are
this helps us to understand is
we are constantly connected our mind thinks
is disconnected from everything
we are not we are constantly we are not just individuals we are part of something bigger we are all connected constantly
what we are doing
um is
um is to feel
that connection
to to realize
uh everything outside constantly is moving
creating my insight
if i become aware of
connection i can be the one also helping to change
network
this is
we are practicing
let's read the information for today uh
one of the things
i have been getting around is uh
um
we are feeling some emotions
are not correlative to
is happening right
so for example myself today i was feeling really weird today
this is not
was nothing happening really to make me feel like
but
maybe is happening to to many of you
this is
we are working with the cleaning of the system
because we are cleaning
everything
was hidden stocked in our self in our being in our body our soul starts to perch
it starts to clean up okay
just feel it allow you to feel it
express it into the outside
it can be used
um let all these trans
things go out
we are used to repressed all these emotions
what we are trying to do is to let it all out okay that's the most important thing remember always we are in the first cycle the first month hollak related to the constellation of leo
its mantra
like the vibration of the day is ha
the sound high represents h the history
life
ah the sound i represents the um the consciousness
the mind
the thinking the thoughts in the third eye
the statement of today is i am the life of thoughts
basically means
i am the one
creates to nourish my thoughts
the code of today is the process of exhalation in the transcendence
the code of exhalation transcendence says
the universe with the certainty of being all
decides to free from itself launching itself to the deepest dream devoid
neutrality becomes nothingness
every potential brutality path pattern idea or dream ceases to exist it finds freedom in its mind giving itself the possibility to marveling again in a new site
means basically
the universe also dies
it leaves everything into the transcendence like nothing of
that i have experienced lived it's really mine
i let leave all of
away
when it comes to the to the nothingness
it comes to the void it takes again the possibility to breathe again to
to greet
side
to create a new reality
it's by leaving all away the patterns everything
you are able to create any reality
we are all ready we are going to make the alignment look for a comfortable position
remember if you can position yourself in the tetrahedron shape better
just relax
let it flow remember always try to be seated no laying down okay remember
the
we are like
is
we are not working with the earth
we are working heaven
earth the coherence of paul remember
the tetrahedron position is your back straight you cross your legs
put your arm straight
your hands resting on your knees
we start just caressing the skin along all our body to let the nervous system know
we are going to work with the energy i focus in my breathing caressing with the tip of my fingers all my body softly i start to relax my body letting the weight of my shoulders my arms my hands to fall down focus my breathing take a deep breath
with my imagination i go with the oxygen through my lungs my heart the blood towards the organs
muscles i become aware of my body
and
take a deep breath
recognize the hottest part of your body i recognize
part of my body
i become aware
this heat is
all my emotions today are stuck locked in my body without judgment i just allow myself to feel
emotion it doesn't matter if the emotion is low or high i just recognized it just allow myself to feel it without touching oh i become aware of
energy coming out from my body
creating the energy of my aura today without judgment no thinking i will watch the color of
energy i recognize it i feel it
