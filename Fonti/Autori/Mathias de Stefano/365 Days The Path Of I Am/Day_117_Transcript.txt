hi everyone how are you buenos dias 
good morning good afternoon good evening 
hi to all of you I think the signal is fine today so I 
hope you are listening well so if you want to know how I've how I 
how am I um so today um 
down here I'm feeling fine but I am headache today very headache 
and um well um I have never had so much pain 
in every different parts of my body since I don't know many times so I guess 
I don't know I'm feeling older I don't know or I I have been working too much 
with my inner self this physical week so so so so I went so 
deep that I took everything out and and that's it 
so we only have three more days of Scorpio so let's go to the so that for the topic 
for today which is pressure 
so when we speak about pressure um most of us can 
feel can can perceive that this is something that really hurts us that is really bad for 
us because we don't like to live under pressure but the reality is that we are 
constantly Under Pressure the reality itself exists because of pressure 
and this is why it's important to understand to be aware of what pressure 
means in existence so we could know how to handle it and how to understand its 
purpose so the main image that we have to acknowledge to understand pressure 
is to to go back as we have always picture the 
origin of the universe the universe expressed itself okay from within 
towards the other side and when it does this it is the inner and the negative aspect 
aspect of the universe expressing itself outside to project in the positive and 
then the positive is willing to go back as the heartbeat towards the inside 
this means that the negative is looking for the positive outside and the positive is looking for the negative 
inside this creates what we call the magnetism magnetism where the positive and the 
negative are trying to get together 
so the negative is trying to express in the outside and the positive is trying 
to integrate in the inside of the negative 
so when this happens the negative and the positive are trying to be together 
so they create like this friction that creates energy trying to match one 
between the other so with this they create a third Force which is the 
creation itself this is why positive and negative are the polarity that helps the 
universe exist these two um these two 
um forces positive and negative are looking each other in order to integrate 
one trying to express the other one trying to integrate itself and these two 
by force by pressure they create the Third aspect which is the creation itself so 
this pressure is the one that allows the universe to exist 
huh so this positive and negative the 
positive and the negative when they start to move they get waves of 
vibration so when this vibration starts to move faster and faster by frequencies 
different frequencies it creates a particle and the particle 
is a conjunction of different frequencies of different vibrations in 
um in frequency okay Express in frequencies so 
okay there are many things in the middle of course but let's go to the most known of 
all which is when we have this particle we have this particle in negative an 
electron and then we have the proton as the positive so they attract each other 
in order to be okay together 
uh this particles starts to join together to try 
to find balance in between positive and negative constantly trying to put all 
together okay again to try to to mix the energies with this 
energy they finish different types of positive and negative in between the 
different atoms creating molecules and the molecules are the ones 
starting to create matter okay so this particles that creates atoms 
that creates molecules that creates chemicals the matter 
they also are the ones that will create the structures of reality that will create that will create 
um the structures of life so the main four that we will have in order to talk about life will be 
oxygen nitrogen hydrogen and carbon those are the main 
four to create life so these four are just some of the most 
important but they are not only in our um bodies they are not only in our 
biological bodies they are in everything they are connected in um they are in in the stars in the Sun 
and they are everywhere so to understand this these are the 
the main structures that where the Simon created 
when the energy was trying to press in the very beginning so in the very 
beginning all the pressure of all this positive and negative creating these elements was 
so huge the pressure was such so huge 
that immediately it created neutrality in the middle and exploded and that's what we 
call the big bang the great explosion uh so basically the energetical world 
compress itself so much that give birth to the physical world 
so thanks to the pressure of the mental reality 
appears the energetical reality and thanks to the pressure 
of the negative of the energetical reality 
we have the physical reality so basically the universe exists due to 
the pressure to the pressure of Dimensions so all the 
dimensions pressing the universe is the one creating the physical reality 
imagine this we are vibration and energy that is being 
is being compressed so we are all that compressed that's why we exist what 
would happen if we just spread and the dimensions stop to put their pressures 
on us it spread and spread and spread and suddenly 
we start to see the light and we disappear we just stop being 
compressed by the universe and that's what we call Enlightenment enlightenment 
is when all your particles just separate each other 
throughout all the dimensions that's what happened when you get 
enlighted so this is kind of like taking out all the magic of enlightenment 
but it's another point of view of course to to understand what happened how how it 
happens um 
so the reason why the universe is trying to compress everything 
is because when it compressed the reality the 
the universe is able to see what is imagining in the mind 
and also is able to feel what is seeing and is able to live what is feeling 
okay so as much compress it is as much pressure it has 
we are able to perceive more and more 
specific points of the universe 
this is this is why the universe generates a system of pressure 
so pressure allows a black hole to create a Galaxy a Galaxy to create Stars 
stars to create planets planets to create life goes back to the planet 
the planet goes back to the Stars the stars go back to the 
Galaxy and the Galaxy goes back to the black hole 
so by pressure We Exist because a star explodes 
because of the pressure that it feels and then by pressure of gravity it 
starts to move all back again to the Core 
there are many other factors of why this is happening but 
we will speak about that in other moments let's picture these two words 
sharp and acute it's Sharp um we call it sharp like Gravity the the 
origin of Latin uh of of of gravity means sharp okay 
so something that is sharp is like going low in vibration like 
all and the opposite acute it goes up [Music] 
these two different vibrations if we picture it like like vibration like sound like music 
so we would understand that gravity is to going down 
okay and the opposite will be to go 
up with an acute sound so the explosion would be the acute in 
expression and then going back would be gravity which is 
the low vibration so we usually think that gravity the low 
vibration is going down we think that it's going down 
but it's not going down is to go to the center by a spiral of move or a spiral 
of movement okay so um so it doesn't need to go down 
the only reason why we call gravity the concept of going 
down is because from our point of view the force that is pushing us to the 
center is below so that's why we call it to go down 
because that's how we perceive it but it's not why it's already happening okay 
so what we call to go down which is gravity 
is thinking that we are going into a low vibration going down something that is 
severe okay but um but for the universe there's no below 
for the universe doesn't exist the concept of below this is from our point 
of view that we call gravity severe something that is bringing us down 
the reason why for us gravity and the 
concept of going in a low vibration is something that why uh pressure to be 
pressed is something wrong is because for us to be pressed to feel the 
pressure of gravity going down means to 
humiliate ourselves to go under someone to put yourself 
in a lower status okay so from our point of view the 
pressure is related to oppression is related to the concept of being under someone 
foreign 
this is why we have a negative connotation 
when we speak about pressure and going down 
so this is something only for 
our human point of view from our human point of perception this 
is something that in the universe doesn't exist in the universe all these words of being 
low gravity pressure um 
yeah all of those Concepts they don't have a concept of negativity 
even negative is something that doesn't have any sense for the universe as something bad 
so from the point of view of Earth this have a negativity point of view 
but negative point of view but if we go to the universe it doesn't have it 
anymore so this explains why 
um why we need pressure in our lives 
because pressure is the key for existence so that's why 
we reproduce by pressure we are born by pressure 
we uh we live our lives culturally emotionally 
uh in education in war in jobs under 
pressure our family puts pressure the religion 
puts pressure everything around puts pressure on us 
even blood pressure atmospheric pressure 
breathing everything is something of pressure 
sometimes we forget that the most easiest things that makes us be what we 
are like breathing like heartbeat 
are due to pressure we are alive because of pressure 
and we are here existing because of the pressure of the atoms 
of hydrogen nitrogen carbon and oxygen 
you are in the surface above in the surface of the world 
as much above you are the soft the connections of the of the particles 
in your atoms are so you live in the surface and it's more 
more spread and as you go deeper to the core of a world or to a core of a of a 
sun so the space of the particles will be 
closer and being together pressing one to each other 
just now imagine that for example this is the distance that I have between an 
electron and a proton in my body hmm 
because of pressure if I go under the earth going lower and lower and lower 
the pressure will be closer because of gravity until 
it gets very close and touch 
when they they create the same energy like the 
fusion so it's like um 
like the core of a sun creating a lot of energy 
too much pressure this is why also for the astronauts for example that goes in the outer space 
they they get older um 
um slower than people on the on the Earth because they start to expand 
not much gravity so this makes us understand that when 
you have something really expanded there's no need to transform 
because everything is floating softly but as closer it gets 
much more transformation much more speed so transformation 
this is why formation can only be 
lived under a lot of pressure 
so this 
when you have these two particles so remember 
transformation transformation means to change your forms to be able to 
go beyond your forms and in order to do that you need for your atoms to be able 
to change to modify its position so an atom 
that doesn't change its position because it's relaxed 
will never transform so in order 
to transform they need to get closer to be pressed 
to have pressure and that's how these two different 
energies starts to move faster and faster and change 
so this is why we may have heard the sentence we are diamonds in raw 
and this is because we are made of the same thing of a diamond 
um diamonds are made up with carbon we are carbon 
so but our carbon is organized in a very wide 
and relaxed way compare to the pressure of the carbon of a diamond 
okay so that's the only difference is the 
pressure so maybe if you want if we want to become diamonds what we would have to do 
is to go maybe like 30 kilometers underground and 
but just with a T-shirt and let's see 
what we have to understand from all of this is that when we are talking about pressure and we say I don't want to feel 
this pressure anymore what we have to acknowledge is that pressure is the 
thing that is trying to makes us change to transform ourselves without pressure 
we wouldn't be able to transform ourselves in a physical world so talking about pressure 
now we fight we find out that we have two different ways in which we can live pressure 
one is by Consciousness and the other one by the unconscious 
by Consciousness it means that you take the pressure and you put a goal on it 
you know that it's for your greatest good that you are gonna use that pressure to transform and to evolve 
in the unconscious way you suffer suffering is the choice of the 
unconscious person of the unconscious person that has no 
clue of why that person is living the pressure 
that's why there we can say that suffering is the choice but 
um for sure you have heard that people saying suffering is only a choice but it's not like okay if it's a choice I 
chew I I choose now not to not to suffer and I don't want her anymore I choose 
that it's not how it works basically that's not the way because when you say 
I don't want to suffer that that won't be a way out uh the way out of suffering would be to 
acknowledge why I am living what I am living why is the reason why is the goal 
of the things that I am living and try to put a meaning on the things 
that you leave okay and that's that's what we'll take you 
out from South and this would be the logic of 
pressure the vibration for today is Cho 
the statement for today is I am the use of emptiness 
the code for today conscious integration just as I have become aware of the 
integration process when instead of 
eradicating what I censored that was stopping me 
I use these tools forces patterns with a common objective coherent and with a 
specific purpose focusing in knowing that I am the final product of all that 
and denying it is nothing more than denying myself 
thank you [Music] 
[Applause] 
thank you [Music] 
[Applause] [Music] 
[Applause] [Music] I'm focus on my breathing 
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] 
[Music] 
[Music] 
and softly I start to massage and carries my body 
starting from the ground [Music] 
the feet [Applause] [Music] 
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
foreign [Music] 
[Music] I talk to my body 
saying to it that everything that I am doing is for its greatest 
[Applause] foreign [Music] 
foreign [Music] 
by a forest full of trees 
and I walk inside of it 
through the trees listening to the birds and insects 
[Music] 
[Music] as I walk inside of this Forest 
it starts to become like a rainforest each 
time more and more Darkness 
[Laughter] in the middle of this rainforest I find 
this huge tree than with its branches and leaves 
Culver's old sky [Music] 
and from above causes his little rays of light from the 
sun come through the leaves like stars 
[Music] 
[Applause] I get closer to the tree 
and touch the trunk Christmas Trust 
I lay down in between its roots to watching the sky 
[Music] 
I recognize that this is the Tree of Life this is the great tree of the universe 
[Music] All of the Stars the planets the 
galaxies they all consist within the street 
and I am part of it 
I've become one of its roots being absorbed by the mat around me 
[Music] 
I feel the mud swallowing my body [Music] 
my legs and feet my hands and arms 
my entire body the chest back shoulders neck 
and my head letting only my nose and eyes 
[Applause] out 
[Music] 
I absorb all the nutrients of this tree [Music] 
foreign [Music] 
I am part of this universe [Music] 
[Applause] and feel the pressure of my body 
the pressure of the mouth Earth and roots pushing me 
with all its weight towards the ground 
and I recognize I am the product of all pressure in the universe 
and I recognize that this is the same pressure that allows my inner seed 
to grow up to flower [Music] 
I'm fine we feature this seed Within Me 
and how the pressures the mud the water and Earth 
the universal Tree on the roots press towards it 
I feel the pressure on the seat and it starts to sing 
activating it's light 
[Applause] [Music] 
foreign [Music] 
foreign [Music] 
[Music] 
I am the universal emptiness 
[Music] 
and as I become aware [Music] that this void 
is watering the seed 
I began to bring this mod all over my body 
carries and touching spreading it on my skin 
[Music] and I recognize 
that I am water and Earth I am not 
promise for iron human [Music] 
[Laughter] foreign [Music] 
foreign [Music] 
thank you everybody for being there and as always see you tomorrow
