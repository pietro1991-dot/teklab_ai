hi everyone good morning good evening good night I hope you're listening me well
I hope you are okay um
we could start with the second day of
emotional week in the third eye I always want to say something
I forget
it was
first of all
I wanted to um
I wanted to tell you everyone
maybe there's new people
um just wanted to let you know
what we are doing daily is something
um is something
it would be a whole year okay um
if you just if you have has uh joined us right
so don't worry there's no problem um
uh it doesn't matter if you do it specifically as we are doing it day by day okay if you buy your daily work or or your inner process you need more time or you need to start again you can do it as you wish as you can okay
this is a process for each one for each one of you
if you want to join us
it's okay
you will go with the wave
if you want to start from the very beginning you can do it anytime okay
don't worry about the timings of
the important thing is
we are a lot of people doing it day by day for everyone too also for the people
maybe are joining us
doesn't believe in all these things
just they saw
and they they are watching it maybe you will think
we are crazy
but
we are just doing is like a psychological session with many with a lot of people trying to work with the inner uh with the inner part of ourselves
try to be more imbalanced
feel free to judge the third eye is related with the the projection
we have from the other side from the outer world something
we had spoken yesterday
yesterday we we've been speaking
we've been speaking
the outer world is sending us Vibes vibrations
change the inner energy
by by
Movement by
reaction of the energy Within um it activates
we call emotions
this is
we perceive
receive
we believe is an emotion
we have to remember
recognize
the emotion is a is an energetical reaction of the vibration
comes from outside
remember
um
reaction of energy due to the the vibration creates a reaction a chemical reaction in our body
activates the hormones
those hormones sense um pulses to our brain who is the one
understand the
uh yeah
understand
information as emotion emotions or feelings usually a lot of people from the spiritual world or emotional people used to think
emotion is kind of a magic thing
we are not supposed to analyze with the mind
we have to just fill it with the heart
we are not against
it is like
but you need to understand it also in order to know
to handle it okay let's remember
magic is okay magic comes from the in the European word
is
means power
was inherited by the by the Persians
created the concept of marush
is the one
has the power it means power okay
power
those who knew
to handle the reality
to manage the matter uh the chemistry uh the chemical they knew
to handle the chemistry
chemistry in Arabic languages we used to say it al-qamiya al-qamiya it's the origin of the world Alchemy okay
Alchemy is the ability to have the power to transform reality through science
magic is just a concept
we used to um to take to explain the science
hasn't been discovered yet or the science
we cannot understand
this is
when we try to understand the Magical World is just different aspects of the reality
we cannot comprehend yet
we just can't feel
is
feeling we usually related with the um magical we have to understand
um
is important to realize about
for to to get the idea
everything
exists the matter is just um the matter is just the expression of the chemistry
by understanding chemistry
you do is to understand the basis of the energy
the frequencies
vibration
is the language of the spirit okay
everything is one all is one emotion would be like a consequence of the mind
let's remember
the emotion comes from an interpretation of the world
emotions are the chemical reaction the potions of
magic
allows me to fill the world
we have two different ways in
we can relate ourselves with these potions of emotions
is from the outer side
we receive the energy to create the potions of emotions within ourselves or
we know
to do it by ourselves within
project it into the outside world
yesterday we spoke about
the
the outside world is the reaction to the inside
how from
today
we are going to speak about is
from the inner world from the inside we can react
make a reaction into the outside world as we spoke yesterday the energies from the outer world will transform the inner world
also we can use
energy from within to use it to transform the outer world
we usually do
we do it all the time
um
usually
we usually
we used to to do um is through the unconscious way we do it unaware of
so we do it maybe sometimes very bad
we naturally
we do unaware of
is
we provoke emotions in the people around we provoke actions attitudes in the people
we have around ourselves we have naturalized
but um
we don't usually realize
we are transforming people around ourselves just by being
just by sitting
just sharing the same space with people
power
we have uh it's a real power
we can use to transform things
we don't know
to use it
we just see the reactions in the outer world like someone got mad at me someone is feeling stuff for me
I don't know
it's the pulses of myself
are pushing
energy to create
emotion
for example it's it's incredible
we have materialized the fact
just me being
can affect the emotion of someone else
we just uh think about
as cultural
by tradition we just understood
it's normal
we can I don't know if I produce love in someone
that person will love me we just naturalized
as a cultural thing
it's not we have to go into the basis
in the quantum in the in the chemical aspects everything
that is very powerful it's very powerful it's something it's a power
you have Within
as we have to recognize
I am like a sponge
absorbs everything from the outside transforming
reaction into emotion I also create a pulse
creates a reaction
creates emotions
same energy
can come to me
transform my life is the same energy
I can use to give it
transform the life of others any emotion or any pulse negative or positive will create a wave of reaction something easy to see if we had really work with ourselves
we have worked perfectly with the coherence within is by just seeing the reaction of the people around us
those people will react according to the pulses of energy
I am sending we usually call
that the others are a mirror of yourself
are reflecting yourself
have you ever asked
this reflection works the way it works is by Echoes we have to remember
we are like in the middle of an ocean inside an ocean within the water
all
water
is around us is vibration
whenever I move myself the waves move
whatever I'm pulsing for myself it starts to pearls outside
all the bodies
are around they come back to me as Echoes like a sonar of a ship
this sonar comes back to me
that's
I see the reflection of myself
is
we see ourselves reflected in some people it's not
that people is just a reflection of me
because I am projecting
energy around
the body of
person is echoing my own energy
I see myself in
person you get it just to to understand
also um we usually are related with the people
we say is a mirror in my life
we say to
person
is a mirror
reflecting everything
I kind of kind of can blame
person sometimes
it's like an example of myself outside
no
really is happening is like imagine like
person is like like a wall like a like a rock
I am projecting energy Echoes
The Echoes just heat the rock or the wall
come back to me
this helps me to understand also
forgiveness means
forgiveness is not to forgive the people the person is to give away for give to give away the idea of
person being a reflection of myself
person with just the echo of
I expressed
has nothing in common with me
I have to let
person free from my perspective
everything
I have around are just objects
my own pulse goes
reflects myself constantly
is
in all the things
we see we see ourselves reflected
maybe
thing
we are seeing is in the same vibration as me
it's my own pulse
is receiving
energy
this is something
helps us to to be very responsible
I have to think about
I am reflecting to others
what I am I'm
what I am receiving as a reflection of myself everything
exists
every living being is creating a pulse even if it just had one cell huh just one cell it's sending a pulse
that's
every person everything is just making Echoes one to another picture yourself like if you are inside a cave
the cave has many many corners
many stalactites
so
you say something
you express a sound the echo of
will be resonating in every aspect of the cave
the sound won't be perfect
there are
many
each one of them will be receiving
reflecting a different pattern of energy
this is
every person is like an echo a resounding of the whole existence
usually we are repeating
Echo by being unconscious
is
we do every day just by talking by being we just move constantly all the echoes as if we are stalactus like in the cave imagine
like you being a stalacted
the other person another one they are like the tuning Forks okay
picture The Tuning Fork
one of them starts to vibrate the resounding goes to the other one
they start to resonate in the same vibration
this is
we used to call the mirror okay
it's not exactly a mirror
it is is
resounding it's a Resonance of the other one
when I become conscious I recognize
I am the one able to create originate one of those vibrations
suddenly by being conscious I realized
just by being the other people starts to express emotions attitudes something okay
we call mirror
the thing of watch myself in the other is better to say the other is echoing myself
we see some emotions from the outside
are coming from other people to us we have to think about
or
did I allow for myself to express
energy
it's coming back towards me in
way
of course we can put ourselves in the position of I am not doing anything wrong
I am I'm receiving people
is hurting me
is doing bad things to me
is
because it doesn't matter if you do something good or bad it's about low vibration or high vibration maybe you are vibrating
low
the only thing you can receive is low vibration don't fall yourself in the Trump
you may say um
you may say um uh there's bad people
good people um
and um I don't know uh I am doing good things
happened bad things to me don't think
bad things are low vibration or high Things Are good things okay don't fall down don't fall in
mistake the question
we have to solve today is
emotions I am receiving from the outside in my daily day my daily life
what is the pulse
I am emitting okay in order to receive
energy
emotion hmm
this is the task
we have to solve today everything
we are feeling from the outer world um is the energy
I am pulsing towards the outside
what am I pulsing to the outside
I can understand
am I okay
this would be the the idea of
is the mirror okay
is a mirror
how it's myself creating
mirror
then it's
we start to take to become aware of our inner power
when I become aware of the power
I have within I start to pulse differently I decide
to pulse in the outside
the response will be different too according to my polls today I wrote
when you do
acknowledging
you switch your energy you usually try to change
change is not the same as transform these two concepts would be explained like
to change is the concept of polarity
duality
transform is a concept of unity
Transcendence
to change would be easy to understand in a circle or a sphere
to make a 180 degrees change
would be to change
you switch from one side to another
you were looking into one side
then you are looking into the opposite we could say
they changes towards night
night changes towards a day transformation would be a turn of 360 degrees
you make the whole turn
you were in
spot you did the whole turn
you went back to the same spot
in
trip you saw all the perspective
you could possibly be
then you came back to explain to give
you have experienced
realize about yourself
transformation
for example a change of 180 degrees would be someone
was a scientist
that was um atheist
suddenly it has a Awakening
you just change your mind
sadly you became um I don't know yoga teacher Reiki master
you don't want to see anything about science that's a change
to transform would be the same scientist
instead of just changing get some ideas of the Reiki some ideas of yoga
from many other things to help him to improve its own perception of the reality
it can help himself or others through learning different things from science to help in science okay
that's transformation
I I am explaining these two concepts
those change
transformation are the most important
switch the idea of
we pulse into the world
I start to pulse change in my life sadly the rest from my perspective they changed too
they change in the opposite
suddenly I lose friends I lose family I lose everyone
I changed
by changing I just left just left I just turned the back to them okay
if I pause from transformation is different if I pull from transformation I can help the others also to transform themselves by watching
I am transforming myself step by step
I I share my change I'm not just giving the back to the others I hope
by saying
um we have clear
what is the pulse for the vibration
we are going to use today we have to practice like to blow
say uh ah
for the statement for today is I am the spark of vision
is the first light
we project outside I am the spark of vision
the code for today is the pattern yeah in every Dimension the inner evaluative process is found the different levels those
we can
we call steps governments kingdoms stages levels
is the diagram of the dimensions best known by us the one
tells us
is superior
inferior the Ascension
Ascension of the universal entities the LI sound reminds us
we all are in different comprehensions levels in each one of the perspectives let's go to
so remember
the task is to um uh to write down a sentence or a paragraph
you can explain from
you are pulsing by try to understand
emotions
what things are coming back to you okay
is the pulse of you
um sit comfortable
start to carries the body
let's go to
aside carries the body I thanks it for being the anchor of the spiritual world in the matter I relax the body I leave the weight fall down
focused my breathing take a deep breath bringing the oxygen through your nose lungs hard blood organs
muscles take a deep breath
allow yourself to feel the heat within your body
how it comes through your skin towards every direction around you I start to perceive the ocean around me with all the heat
I am an age I perceive
feel myself inside the water below the water
perceive
the waves of energy
the duration moves your body try to allow your body to move Softly side by side
front
back as if you are being pushed Softly by the waves I recognize
this ocean is made with all the vibrations
energies
creates the movement of the very creation has my own emotions it connects me with everything
then I allow myself to feel above the light of the Sun the energy of the I am take deep breath
start to go up until you can feel the limits of the water in the ocean to touch your crown I feel the heat of the Sun the light of the consciousness to touch my crown I go a little bit more up feeling
your head is trying to go outside like an island being bigger
bigger
I feel the water surrounding the head going down until I feel the limit of the water below my eyes in my nose in my ears feeling the half of my head outside in the air
the rest of the body below
water I feel the light of the Sun all over my eyes my hair my head ears
nose I allow myself to observe the limits of
ocean
divides the sea of the sky
all the waves around me I recognize
I can observe visualize contemplate all
energy
moves me
that I move I feel the light of the I am in my eyes
my crown take deep breath
start to enlighten the spark of my vision foreign keep pronouncing the sound I allow myself to enlighten the Fire Within Me
the light of it through my eyes projected towards the horizon I allow myself to see
ocean of Energies hi hi I recognize I am the spark of vision I am the spark of vision I am the spark of vision I recognize
with my vision my perception I can move the waves of
ocean with consciousness I take my hands to my heart I become aware
everything
I observe in the exterior is an echo of Within I recognize
I am able to move
to pulse from consciousness I recognize
everything outside is just a reflection of the inside of my perception
if I shine everything around me will shine I am the spark of vision I am the spark of vision I am the spark of vision take a deep breath
from your heart start to move caressing your body touching the water around you stretching yawning
I come back
and
opening my eyes
remember
the task is to watch
ocean around to see
it is related with you through emotions
then you ask yourself
or from
I am pulsing
reality
thank you all for being
and as always see you tomorrow at the same time for the throat drink a lot of water
rest a lot see you tomorrow
