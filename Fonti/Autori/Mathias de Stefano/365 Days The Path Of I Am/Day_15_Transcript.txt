hi everyone good morning good evening good night welcome to another alignment day i hope
the post today helps you to danger
to clarify some things
one of the things
i wanted to clarify from the post today is about our perception
it's been
long
much time
we had um have been taught about darkness as someone against us
reality darkness is just another creature
is evolving in
universe
we all are we cannot recognize the purpose of darkness until we face our own darkness our own things
we have within one of the main things
um we need to understand is
um we usually think
darkness is something against the light
and it's not like
darkness is not against light darkness is the distortion of light
this is something very important to understand
darkness is the distortion of light
we as humans used to we used to think to to to believe
everything is opposite
everything is just opposite to each other like positive negative no they are not opposite they are complementing uh one of the main things
helps to understand
um
is no forces in the universe
are against each other
all the forces are commendatory to each other um well
knowledge the acknowledging
will help us to realize
we we don't have to fight against anything
we just have to balance
one of the things
we
we are using to do um
that we are uh
this last period we are doing is to call ourselves like warriors warriors of light rainbow warriors
there's no war to fight we are not warriors i'm not a warrior um have come
for a different thing all the things
we have like fighting like um like uh yes like fighting um they are just a human perspective it's not the truth it's just a human perspective of fighting of trying to survive
one of the things
we fight or we are against each other is
we we fight to take control over the other ones
as i take control over the other ones is
i want to expand my territory
the reason
i want to expand my territory is
i want to have more things
i want to have things
i just want to have something to survive like food
i don't want to die everyone who is fighting basically is fighting for survival
there are many wars not only
on earth also in other constellations other dimensions not all the wars are fought with guns um or swords
it doesn't matter
war we are trying to fight um the last battle of all the battles is the one we have within is with ourselves
of course the only thing we have to fight for within is
war between our light
our darkness
as i said
the darkness is just the distortion of light
basically the war is the light fighting with itself in its different perspectives
darkness doesn't exist you don't need to find a balance between both of them
the darkness is just the light distortion distorted
we go towards our darkness they are
are just potentials
we had no idea
to use them properly any conflict
war
we have with ourselves within with someone in our environment or even the warrior between countries they are just potentials
has hadn't been really worked properly
it's normal for us
that we go into
path of evolution getting even more um confused
as more experiences we have more distortion
we lose the clarity once we realize
every darkness
we face in our lives are just our own light distorted we just realized
to be free we just need to lock our darkness to recognize it to honor it
to let the the light shine properly according to
darkness made us we make ourselves free from
all our history has brought us to believe
there are good things
bad things
the truth is
they are not things
are bad or
they are bad or good
there is only things unbalanced
the most important job
we have in our lives is to work with ourselves to achieve
i know it's difficult to accept most of the times
the most horrible facts
acts
used to happen in the society to accept the the worst thing
happens in our society the horrible facts uh
uh of course it's very difficult for us to understand
they happen
the truth is
there are no bad things by nature it starts to unbalance by the experience
is
our great possibility is to try to bring back the balance
i myself has have lived many of the darkness things demons possessions many things along my life
and uh i faced the darkness i i i know
they work i i know
they exceed they have force
um
was one day
i just felt them
i experienced the acknowledging of they are a part of me i cannot fight them
they are part of myself
i just talk to them
hug them
and say thank you i love you
now i understand
you are just showing me a part of myself
i couldn't see by myself
since
moment they don't bother me i sometimes feel them
don't bother
they are myself
then we have the other fight
fighting the outside sometimes is easier than fighting the inside
is to see your own darkness
how dark can you be to others that's more difficult it's very difficult to understand the darkness
how they work watching them from the side of the light
our normal perspective is to think
we are in the right side i guess
one of the uh best ways to understand
darkness
light works is touch planet the channel or maybe some discovery channel i don't know according to
um to
what i said of watching watching planet is like um you see two stories in one documentary uh one is the the deer
you see
they grow up
how they um i don't know you you just uh love the you just love the deer
how they grow up
also you see
the story of the lion
how the lion also mother
how the mother takes care of the of the child
of the of the lion uh the
do you say the the tiny lot i don't know the word in english um
um
you love with both of them
they had a cup cup they have amazing stories
they are beautiful
they you love both mothers
suddenly one of the mothers fights the other one
eats the child it's the deer
you just see everything you know in the documentary they show you everything the blood everything
suddenly you say who the guy
because the cop was hungry
he was about to die if he wouldn't eat anything
the mother went to look for lunch
who's the dark one
you watch nature you can just pretend
that thing
we believe is something cruel or is just an act of survival that's all
it is the people
makes terrible things
we say they are bad people they are just trying to survive
i am also talking about murderers rapers rapists um tyranny all the people
we usually say they are bad people they're all people
has suffered kids
have suffered
they were child people
weren't able to feel love to express their own truth people
were hurt it's people in the subconscious they believe
think
hurting others is the way of love
this is one of the most difficult teachings
even jesus even jesus said forgive them
they don't know
they are doing every every fact of evil is just a fact a matter of distortion
this is
what we are doing every day by the alignments is to try to balance to align
distortion
in order to help these distortions in the world with all these people
is distorted
we have to do is to start by our own distortion
i've seen many people asking
also the markers also
and
ever everyone they were all kids
were hurt okay
our goal is not to our goal is not to fight against
happened it's not to judge
happened is to heal ourselves
we allow the future not to happen in the future to be free from
so in order to make
possible in the future
we have to is to set ourselves free from the perception of fighting to forgive everyone in the past of everything
they did
to give love to the future's future children's you have to go through the same things it's very easy to put ourselves in the like judges of
is good
what is bad
it's not our task all
that i am speaking is important to make the alignment we are not connected to make a beautiful meditation whatever we are
to work with
so
we are going to align
is
we are speaking there's no need to integrate or accept
right
we have uh we have a lot of time a lot of um thousands of years if you want you will someday there's no rush someone asked even the network of people is doing pedophilia
eating children yes even them even them
if we are not recognizing
we are all one
we are all the same
we are not able to forgive
we are hating someone
we are inheriting
to our childs in the future to hate someone
is one of the most difficult tasks ever we call
compassion
is the most difficult thing
this is
we are
to try to align it
i'm taking my time to explain all
because the sacrament chakra is the one
absorbs all
all
pain all these beliefs all these emotions
remember
all darkness is just distortion of light if i am light
i bribe myself the distortion stops the vibration of today is
the sound
is h life
this sound is the represents the gestation the womb the statement of today is i am the generating life the code of today is the vibration e is not e with
vibration the singing
the voice originate with
sound it is beginning of the world the creative verve who with force elevates propelling the echoes of the cosmos like waves in the universal ocean is the truth coherence willingness to learn let's go to
sorry if i am like weird i'm not tired or or distracted just every day i'm just coming more in myself
my higher self is not like me i i have humor a lot
on
he he doesn't he's more straight i am more
this is
i am more like
i'm kind of putting both of them together
that's it take a deep breath i can massage softly to my body to thank to be the anchor of my higher self i just focus in my breathing take a deep breath relax in the body i feel the oxygen through my lungs my heart blood muscles
organs breathe in i feel the heat coming out of my body i become aware of the hottest party i observe the color of
heat surrounding all my aura breathe in i recognize all the things
i did today
take a moment to feel the emotions related to each one of them
is the emotion
i felt the most today i take with my hands all these emotions these colors
hot
i bring them all around my hip all around the sacrum i visualize the wheel the circle i allow myself to feel the heat around i take a moment to recognize
in
part of my body i can find the engine
creates every one of my emotions is the center of my creation without judgment i allow myself to feel each one of these emotions the ones
nourish me the ones
represent a weight for me is
within my intestines
the inner battle is hell is
where the forces of light
darkness create all the energy
makes me be who i am both of them are my creative potential my capacity to create depends on the balance in these two forces as these two forces are finished within me i would waste all the energy
i have unnecessarily both forces are the generators of my life i recognize right
that both of them pushes me towards action without judgment i allow myself to feel around me all these people all these persons
i believe they are my enemies in
life i just allow myself to feel them they could be very close people to you or famous people in the world or people from other dimensions without judgment i perceive
the emotions
they reflect they are my inner demons they are my fear my sorrow my hatred
again these emotions they only live within me they don't live on them is my energy the one
pushes them to be the shadows of my life take a deep breath ah i become aware
is their darkness their shadows
emotions provoked on me
pushes me to look for the light to transcend to begin my own path is
darkness
is guiding you towards the light we're only able to see your inner light
of their darkness is
crisis
conflict
makes me creative for i get enlightenment
i achieve the resolution to
conflict
i can only transcend
by honoring my masters they are just acting
of my need of transcendence
i descend the i am to my sacrum
i say to myself i can forgive the darkness i can't find the balance between the light
darkness i can't forgive myself for creating
darkness i recognize myself as the beautiful child of my fathers
mothers light
darkness i am the result of my emotions therefore i can be my own generator of life take a deep breath
still pronounce the vibration of the day making the wheel spin faster
faster each time until it swallowed by the light of the sacrum chakra um i keep pronouncing it i feel the heat as i pronounce the sound the irradiation of the brighter chakra i feel the expansion of the creator of my emotions i feel the inner light even more brighter taking the light to every direction
bringing clarity to the darkness
take a deep breath
pronounce i am the generator of life i am the narrator of life i am the generator of life i expand my light with my son expanding towards all the network the matrix watching all these beautiful lights like mine the wounds intestines shining all over
and
um the matrix the creator i can't forgive the darkness i can forgive my own darkness i can live imbalance between dark
light for i am the generator of life i take my hands to my heart i recognize the love light
of darkness as a father
a mother i honor both forces within me with all my unconditional love
i start to bring all the love my heart through all my body stretching caressing yawning
opening my eyes slowly come back
and
to recognize
i myself created the darkness thank you for thank you for being
and being part of the network
