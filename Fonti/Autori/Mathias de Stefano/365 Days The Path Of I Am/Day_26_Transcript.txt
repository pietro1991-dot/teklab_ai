hi everyone good morning good evening good night
we have just another day uh only a few 300 remain
no big deal
i hope
that the last day of
year we could be all very aligned or at least everyone really crazy i don't know
i hope it works
let's start with today
uh today um we are related to the sacrum chakra in the physical aspect
which would be the adrenal glands even if we used to relate the energy of the sacrum to the womb belly uh the intestines
region we have to acknowledge
the adrenal glands
are the ones
activate
chakra are on the top of the kidneys
that would be at the high of the middle back okay
yeah
that region
part of of your body
we have to realize
part of the body is the one
most of our frustrations
fears are stopped one of the things we have to to realize about
about
stock of energy is
frustration
fear are two of the emotions
starts in our body
our energy stopped
it's not working properly
we have to first acknowledge
um most of the energy
we receive in our body is created by the absorption of the nutrients
minerals
all the energy from everything
we eat
go through the digestive system the reason
we relate
the the sacrum is
important
is
by the food
is processed
we create all the energy of our body
this is
we relate
sacrum with the place
you create the energy by positive
negative
this is
it's
important to understand
this place is the base from
all the energy is created from
we create things
the reason we can work with
energy within is
we are receiving energy on the outside transforming it into our own energy
also in emotions
this is
from
center we receive the energy
allows us to have strength
to have will
is
by processing
absorbing all these nutrients
all formation the glands the adrenal glands creates the adrenaline
is the hormone
helps us to have will strength to take action
of course
at the moment i block myself
i cannot express uh
action
i
i am stopped to do the action
i do is to bring all
energy
lock it lock it sorry lock it in the kidneys in
region
this is
that same energy is transformed in frustration
i am i am not being able to act
of course all in fear
i am i'm afraid of doing something these two energies these two um the frustration
the
the fear
are
are these two emotions usually
what they
what they do um is to
i have
fear
that
that um
the frustration
i am doing is stopping the action of all
energy i i stopped moving
energy
when they stop they don't move anymore
i am i stop myself okay by doing
um i can get ill okay
if i get ill
i get ill is
i am not being able to move the energy okay it's like i'm i stopped you can you can relate
to be ill with stay still
you can really picture the idea by locking
energy inside of me i am not being able to give to move forward with energy by
is
we have spoken yesterday
we said um
we said you need to forgive yourself
forgive the others
you can move
energy
that stock of energy inside your body
this is
we also relate
um chakra with the sexual energy
um they are feminine
masculine creating life okay
this is
they um we used to relate
chakra with sexuality is the creation of energy
creates
we usually also relate
chakra with sexuality
two energies masculine
feminine they create life through
but um
is the ancient vision
the only sexual creation would be
someone creates life
this is another kind of mixing energies okay
of
sexual energy in the sacrum the sexual energy is in the other one we are going to see tomorrow in
one is the sexual energy towards vision okay of life specifically of life okay uh
is to make a difference in the both centers
center from
i res
we have behind the sacrum is through
we receive a lot of energy in our body the way we receive the energy from
part in our back can be received in two different ways the most sensitive ones can receive it in one way
the other one the more human sensitive person the more human perception perceptive persons receive it in different ways
there's no better
is the same they're just differences
the sensitive people must take care very well about of
part of the body
it is a portal
it can receive a lot of information
energy from other dimensions from other levels of consciousness
depending on
i feel if i have low fashion or a high vibration with high vibration i will receive creative information from other from other realities
if we have a low vibration we can receive dark information from other levels
uh
is um one of the parts to
you can know people
can channel or
experience possessions like demons
stuff
is another one we have
one
but usually the channelings bullet channels use
check right
the one in the in the back in the neck um
the lower vibration use the other one in the in the sacrum by the back those are the sensitives
um the other group of of people uh
is the normal humans usually are the people
just walk
go through the life
just live their natural lives
go to work
trap
then at the last moment of the day they had a very very heart pain in the back in the lower back
you don't know
because you had a good day
but heavy pain as information like uh like an um like a magnet like if you wear a magnet bringing all
information to you
both of them are balanced with the same tool
is rising our vibration
the main thing to to to clean
is by purging all the digestive system of the saccharum
the main thing
we have to do is to clean the kidneys
better more water stop with sugars know
to say no like coke
no um
do you say uh yeah no no sugar dreams uh no
others say no coffee um no dark drinks just water water water
water
water two or three liters per day if possible water
water
water okay
the other thing
the water
and
the water is to stop eating dead animals
you just start to clean the body of death death
everything
um has to die
there is a dead body uh
there is within my body uh lows the vibration any animal with an emotional um an emotional level you have to try to eat those things
are not heavy for your kidneys
your intestines
this is in
you start to clean your body some of the people were asking about it's possible to eat uh milk or whatever or those like cheese
so on
i said
i've won about
five meals food
we used to we used to call them poisons
are poisons
are the five white poisons food
is um sugar flour um milk i don't remember the others
um they are very white
um
um these elements
are
are white um are very healthy for you
what i was saying in spanish is
even though salt to too much salt is bad um one of the main things anyway is
there is no a perfect to do the perfect thing okay
each person is different
don't push yourself to um to eat different unless you first try okay
uh
is like time to see to feel
your body reacts
normally you would have to practice very slowly as the body is slow okay you you should not start like changing in just one day you need like a time to do
so for example to live for example you want to leave sugar for example the most difficult one
because we all need love
we all want sugar
um uh sugar you need like 40 days to make a quarantine without sugar the first three weeks you realize
you are an addict okay
you have an addiction your body has has an addiction
you have no idea
after 40 days your body starts to balance okay
you ask if you are better or if you need to go back to eat
don't push yourself to try to go slowly
as i said i am not nutrition nutritionist i have no idea about i'm just the clue of
is a lot of water a lot of water
don't eat dead animals yeah
um i am saying about don't eat dead animals
um if you are in a low vibration
you want to go in a high vibration you need to stop eating something
push you down
if you are like flying around
you don't know
to land sometimes you need um something um heavy like like meat
just allow yourself to to to see
is good for you
remember
it's not about if you feel happy uh eating okay
it's not
for example
you eat something um
you eat something you feel happiness
in the mind like oh
is good like eating a lot of chocolate like
of chocolate you will be happy
you will you will feel happiness
because you feel plenty
you will be dying in your liver okay
try to listen
brain not
one not
one the third one the third brain
this is to take care of the engine
activates the energy of our potential of our action our will remember
in order to know
to start yourself with
cleaning process remember to ask to your doctor to your addressionist whoever
can help you to know
i was just talking for the argentinians
because they were asking about the mate
is a national drink
uruguay
paraguay
sometimes some parts of brazil
the mate energetically is like coffee
when we are trying to make a perch of our body water water
just water okay
just to clarify
uh
is not
in order to make
purge you have to stop doing
eating
drinking whatever you are doing for the whole life no
is exactly like trying to glaring with a diet
going to the gym okay like okay uh sometimes some people will need just more some people a year until they reach the um the state in
they want to find themselves in france okay
then they can start to share to eat too i don't know to go back to eat some things
now you have accomplished to find
balance
you can hold it okay
you will take care
this is just to clarify
uh it's not like in the common life it's not like you are going to go to the gym
doing a diet for 40 days
then that's it you stop
say oh i'm perfect
so you stop going
you stop diet
just start to eat as always no it's a process of changing your way of life
you can keep the balance through your whole life
then made with some garbages you eat
you are
handling it okay
each one of you will know
to do these are just some little advices for
you don't have to exercise yourself with the demon inside
that's if you don't want to end like the like the girl of the exorcist
drink a lot of water let's go to the information the vibration we are going to activate today is the sound su
the s is the path

the statement is i am the path to the creator
the information of today
is not related with the sound we are going to work with is related with just some information of the day of the record of the activation
