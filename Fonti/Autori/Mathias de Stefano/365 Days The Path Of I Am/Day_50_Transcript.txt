hi everyone can you hear me 
so today is the last day we do it we do 
this outside 
um today is the last day we do it 
outside 
um 
but we have no other option right now so 
sorry 
and for sure there will be some noises 
around but anyway all the noise you hear 
you make call it 
Cairo 
and the wind 
is the dessert so 
let's improvise 
happy Equinox to everyone 
so if you are in the southern hemisphere 
so 
um 
Happy Spring 
and if you are in the northern 
hemisphere 
so happy autumn 
so today is the day 50 of our work 
so there's only 300 days left so all 
good we can do it 
so today we close with the Taurus in the 
emotional week 
during the month of uh Hugo 
so today what I wrote was about the 
order 
and 
um 
so this is related also to to give sense 
to give meaning to all the lists that we 
have done during the Virgo the emotional 
week of Virgo 
oh so basically one of the main things 
that 
um we can relate to the constellation of 
Diego is to put order to the things to 
our world 
so remember that Virgo is the 
constellation related to the Earth the 
element Earth 
so 
um that makes this constellation a time 
to work 
here to to 
to work in the Earth with specific 
issues of the matter 
the reason why we relate Virgo with the 
order and to work hard is precisely with 
what we are living today with the 
equinox 
so remember that to put order it means 
that we have to analyze each one of the 
aspects that we have 
so we could 
um so we could 
um 
understand everything that makes us be 
what we are so we we have to work with 
each one of those issues the concept of 
this constellation 
which is to to put order and to analyze 
the deepest things in our body in 
ourselves 
um usually are the things that we don't 
like the much the most because 
um because we don't like to go deeper 
and to analyze and to write down 
everything that 
um that maybe shows that we hadn't been 
working with ourselves 
we relate this constellation with the 
order and to analyze uh very well all 
the things is because in this time in 
the northern Hemi hemisphere we relate 
Virgo with the time with the equinox 
with the time where 
um 
where we are supposed to make the 
Harvest and to separate the seeds of the 
Harvest from the rest of the plant 
so what we do is to select all the to 
select all the 
uh the seats that we collected so we 
could have them to survive during the 
winter 
so this is why 
uh the the agricultures in the past used 
to call to this constellation the 
constellation of work 
the constellation that 
take us to separate 
the wheat from the 
shop 
from the shop 
foreign 
the concept of separate the the wheat 
from the chaff would be to 
um to for us today we would say that uh 
that sense that that sentence means to 
um to separate the good from the bad but 
it's not like that precisely it means to 
analyze uh what is the the use 
of each part of the plant okay in the 
in the Harvest 
so give the power the potential of each 
one of the parts of the plant 
to uh analyze uh to to realize 
um what it is useful for 
so basically the constellation of Virgo 
was the one called the constellation of 
the work and to make a specific work of 
separating and discern all the parts of 
the plant 
so Virgo is the month 
so 
um the constellation of vehicle and then 
the European languages we used to call 
it like 
um where and where uh is the origin of 
the for work in English 
so this means 
is is precisely that the word 
so it's the month where you have to work 
the most to analyze all the parts of the 
things that you had hearts 
so this is why doing all this month our 
work was to work very hard to separate 
the wheat from the chart 
the reason why we usually relate the 
concept of Virgo with the feminine 
figure of a young lady because I'm 
virgin is because 
um usually this 
um this work of separate the seeds and 
to and to uh and to how to say and to 
keep seat in in for the winter was 
something that the young ladies used to 
do it was a word for for 
women 
that's why we relate this constellation 
with the feminine the virgin 
this is why we 
um 
we relate vehicle constellation with 
order because it means to put every one 
of the things in its own place in the 
place where so they are useful for the 
winter 
basically to order is not to 
um to ask for something or to try to 
control something uh over the others to 
order means to put the things where they 
belong 
so this is why through all this our goal 
was to put order in between all the 
aspects that were mixed inside of us 
so it's not to give an order is to put 
order 
in ourselves 
so this is why is one of the most 
difficult months till now I still have 
10 days more 
so to put order means that you have to 
work 
in try to understand and to feel that 
each one of the chakras of the 
potentials that we 
are correlative and coherent with the 
other ones 
so basically Virgo to put order 
see the meaning uh 
um to organize all the things that we 
have Within 
the reason why we are going to work with 
the order today is because 
um 
today we have the 
uh the Taurus today is the Taurus 
so 
um the work of the of the Taurus means 
to just organize 
the system of everything that we have 
worked by emotions 
these past 10 days 
so basically what we are going to do 
today is to empower everything that we 
have been working with this week 
so I would like to share with you a bit 
about today what we have done in the 
pyramid 
so you could see that 
um we also worked with the 
um with the order today with different 
patterns 
um creating a Taurus 
as we are going to do in the meditation 
so what we did today 
um we are 25 people here well and me 
and uh so we put one in the center being 
like the center of the Taurus and then 
12th around the the center 
um and these 12 would represent the 
portals of the dodecahedron in the 
planet 
and 
a bigger circle around 
um with the people one in between the 
other one 
um 
representing the portals of the 
constellations 
so heaven on Earth 
and one Circle 
um 
moving the energy to the one moving the 
energy to the right so we created the 
Taurus the like a engine like mechanism 
of engine to create like for and 
um the reason why we did this today it 
was to balance the the process of uh 
here in the network with the process of 
Earth because Earth today was in The 
Equinox so it was trying to find that 
balance 
so by the movement of Earth we did 
exactly the same inside the pyramid that 
is a representation of Earth 
so because it amplifies the information 
um we just uh uh to benefit from that to 
spread it uh traditions of the network 
of the conscious Network so 
just for you to know a little bit of 
what we did 
so we did a really good job because it 
was very harmonic 
and that's very difficult because 
um to put on 25 people uh just three 
days working so 
and it was really really 
perfect 
we had a perfect work 
in the energy of Peterborough 
so I don't have much more to say now 
about 
this so 
if you need to know something else 
it showed to 
to the blog let's go to the information 
internet is not going well so be patient 
I forgot yesterday to say the sound 
but either I forgot something 
you just do it yourself 
trust yourself 
so today 
the vibration is just 
the blowing 
so the statement for 
um 
the Eternal Spark 
so today the soul pattern is precisely 
the sound 
it says the soul is the energy that 
ignites like a small Spark the intention 
that propagates as additional fire 
rejecting the feelings 
the feelings light 
the first sound is the Breath of Life 
the Soul's breath 
the soft beating of the heart that marks 
the pole of actions Through Time 
it is the pattern that enlightens the 
inner light that makes us go forward 
without stopping 
thing is that 
the wind is doing the same sound so 
if I forget it just follow the wind 
let's start again 
[Music] 
so as always We Begin by caressing 
massaging stretching the body and 
yawning

this ocean 
moves my body Softly 
one side to another 
above me

inhaling the light of the I am 
from all the directions

Lighting in my crown

[Music] 
each one of the fires of my chakras 
side blow activating igniting 
[Music] 
foreign 
that I am activating 
are those 
that pushed me forward 
to create to be

up and down 
and towards all the directions

heart to the crown up 
and from my feet 
the fire ignites my skin 
my body 
towards 
I Feel the Fire 
expanding around and the side blow 
[Music] 
I expand bigger and bigger activating 
the potential of my soul 
I become aware that now 
I can recognize 
my feelings and emotions 
all the things that I accept and I deny 
all my positives and negatives 
I recognize that everything that is me 
it's useful 
I expand the fire around me 
bringing Clarity and Light 
to all this of emotion 
I recognize myself 
[Music] 
as a new son 
star 
Shining 
over the water of my emotions 
I recognize that now I am able
