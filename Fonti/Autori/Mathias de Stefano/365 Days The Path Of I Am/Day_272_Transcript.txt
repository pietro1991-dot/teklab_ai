So I was just staring at me because I look into myself like M. I do n't know why it 's like if I just came from desert or something like this. But no , but anyway , but a bad way maybe to introduce a class , but anyway. So I 've been the whole day sitting and painting , so I 'm really happy because I needed to manifest to experience my artistic part. So Torres brought me the manifestation.

Let 's begin with the topic for today which is resonance. From where it comes from , from two words , the means again and songs , the means to make noise. So we have here the meaning of resonance which is to make a noise again. Easy.

So from where comes this concept of making a noise again. So to understand from where I came from , remember that in the universe there was only one thing that decides to divide by two , given origin to two different things. So this one will be called negative and this one here will be called positive. And what is going to happen with this one , they will divide again.

So they will divide creating other two. So from one to be two and then from two comes four and then divide again creating eight. And this goes on and on and on. Now once the first one is divided and we have this two , this two from the center.

So when these two were together inside of this one as one , they were in tension. But become an action , this intention will be called in tension. What is the intention is the action of being in tension. So remember that because they were both together in tension when they separate , they are still the same.

So they are connected by a line of tension. According to what these two particles are going to be , they will have one kind of tension or another kind of tension. Let 's think like the string of a guitar. As lower is the vibration , the string will be like this.

As higher is the vibration of the string , the chord will violate like this. So this is why something that we have already spoke once is the law violate because this here describes vibration. What is vibration is the very fast movement. So all this is what we call vibration.

All this is vibration , a fast movement. And this here , one going up another one , another one , another one , or the other one going down down down. Our phrase is , what is the frequency? A frequency is the frequency of something.

How long it takes to repeat? Long it takes to , for this point here to repeat here or this one to repeat again to repeat again. How long it takes to repeat? That 's what we call frequency.

So that 's what we call frequency. We can see it in this way. A high frequency is what this is repeating very fast in just one second. But that is very fast.

And low frequency is when the waves start the spots repeats in a long time. Every five minutes for some compared to this one. So that 's low frequency high frequency. So what is the vibration?

The vibration is the movement. So it can be a high vibration. Low vibration is as a matter. It 's movement.

The problem is that the wave is going up again. Taking this and count , let 's go now to the strings of a guitar or a piano. I forgot how it is like in time. So kind of like this.

So imagine like this. In this part here we create the tension because we put tension on the strings. And this spot here is where you touch the the chord the string to make the the The vibration. We have that in the negative we create the tension and in the positive we create the vibration.

In the piano we will have exactly the same. We have the tension here and we play the key and that would be the generator of the tension. When the in between the tension here and the vibration here. The strings will start to violate from low to high.

Like for example. No. No. No.

No. So we have the notes. From low to high vibration. So it was generated a note.

So what is the note is a songs. And noise generated by tension and vibration. So what is the principle of the re songs. The principle of the re songs is this.

Then we have the re mi fa so let 's see the that is the same one. It is the same in another octave. So it means that it is sounding again. The sons re sound.

So the principle of resonance would be that the vibrations will be repeated once and again after certain frequencies after certain times. They will be repeated again in a lower octave or higher octave. This means that the letter C , though. The letter C will be all the time looking for the other letter C. In order to close the system.

When I say this example of the sounds like. I say. No. And I end up there.

For sure you will need something like you need for something to finish. Like it can not be like that. You need to finish it to close it with it. That sound which is the other.

C. If you do n't do that it 's like if you are in comfort sound like if something is not right. So imagine that your life is kind of like this C looking for the other C. And in between you have many notes that are that are this student with the first one. But you have to keep going through all these conflicts until you reach the resolution in the next. So basically this means that.

If I am the note C. I am vibrating in one note in one vibration specifically. But I will try to look for my resonance through my life. Looking for that note that is like myself out there. And for sure through my life I can find.

Let us other notes that. That can help me to find it like when we form a chord for example. Okay so. With form a chord and that 's much more easier.

Yeah so. So we can play with that but even though we are going to look for. My resonance meaning that the same note that I am the same information that I have within me. We 'll be the one that I am.

Because it has my same truth the same truth that I have within. But in another level of consciousness. It will give me something you for me. When we understand this we can get that the truth that we are looking for.

We have related to what we have within for example. When we if we are the note C I 'm going to I 'm going to be looking for another note C for it to be Recent. And maybe if I only find the note A. And I dissonance to the note A.

That 's a mean that note A is in truth. It means that simply violates in a different way. So when we usually use to say I rebound with this or I do n't rebound with this. That you do n't rebound with something does n't mean that that something is not true.

It means that you rebound with this. And it means that your truth is in the C. In another note. So maybe you will need help from other notes to make the note C and E to some beautiful for a song. But it does n't mean that the other one is not true.

So taking it into our reality is to be able to rebound with the complete truth. Because everything has a part of the truth. Everything is resounding. So as you see it 's all vibration it 's impossible to have one that is the real one.

It reality is relative. What it means relative. Relative means a link that is repeated again. A link repeated again relative.

And that means that Relativity is the aspect of the things that are related to one another. Like the family relatives. Relation. So it 's about what am I related to.

So this explains that everything that we live actually is related to what we rebound. It 's not something bad that happens to us because why it happens to me I am a good person. No. I am resounding with that reality.

So that 's why it 's happening to me. And maybe sometimes we have some conflict. And the conflicts are decent. When for example we have two or four notes that does n't really sound properly for a mean for a song.

They are not perfect. So I need to look for another one , the next hit perfect. That solves the problem. The resolution of the sort of the court of the song.

So I have to look for it. And otherwise I 'm going to be. And I 'm going to be. Um.

Resonant. And distorted. But the reason why I got myself into that problem into that dissonance is because I was vibrating. And recently that.

Situation. So the reality we live is according to what we rebound. So this is why what we have to do is to rebound better. So in order to rebound properly what do we have to do.

The same thing as always coherence. What is that? To tie the courts , the strings properly. With the wisdom of the spirit.

That is. Wording. The strings of reality. To sound properly with the body.

Which is the sound. The manifested sound. And. To connect the courts.

The strings. Of the soul. This would be tuning. The resonance.

To tune their instrument. So we can stand here. That here we have. Thanks to.

So this is our instrument. Body , soul , and spirit. And tuning. The strings.

How can we tune all this with. In conditionality. So what it was. In conditionality.

In means negation. The nine. Con means. Together.

A group of things. Dicchio. Means to say. To action.

Quality. Means. A quality. So.

A condition. Condition. Is something that a group of people. Decided together.

To conform. As a truth. So our condition is a group of people that sit and debate and say. Are we all agree with.

Do we all with this. So this is going to be like that. Hmm. So.

Conditionality is the quality of that condition. So what is in conditionality. That things are not. Location by a group of people.

But things are simply. What they are. So how can I become. And conditional.

In wisdom. With the spirit. For that. I have to open.

To listen. To everybody. And to hear. Many other truth.

To learn something. Always. To be open. To receive.

The knowledge of others. Not staying with only what I know. How can it be. And conditional.

In love. So how can I love. With. And.

With. With. With. With.

With. With. With. With.

With. But. They sometimes go under. But.

And day. And and two. And. And.

And. And I think , and. Rather than be the third. And I have.

And so. And so. No. And so.

And so. And if you saw it. You saw it. And conditionality in will is what we spoke the other day , free will.

To set ourselves free from traditions , from the cultures , from the religions , from the beliefs of the clan , of the family that we inherit as something that we think is normal. But in order to do that , first we have to love unconditional and conditional and we have to be unconditional wise. So just to wrap this idea , in ancient times in the clans and times , why people understood that the universe was resonance and vibration and because of this , because of this , they tried to build a language in which they could speak with the universe and try to transform their relatives through the work , trying to reach that resonance and get out from the dissonance. So from those main languages , many others were born because according to the territory , they had to change because each territory has and the people has a specific vibration according to that land.

So that 's why through the music and through the way of speaking , they added the language in many others. So the one that I remember was here in camp in the Nile and we call it to that was the I study. So and this language is R1 that gives birth via of mantra to manifest the vibration and to correct the strings of ourselves. So today in the post , I wrote the letters , the specific letters , the meaning of the letters , what they represent.

But I would like to write it down here , so you have it and I can pronounce the letters so you know the specific sound. So the reason why I 'm going to explain this is because any of those letters and combining them in different structures , we can create a mantra , we can create a name , we can create a song , we can create a mantra that we can say or a mantra that we can sing. So according to the topics that I wrote there , the concept that I wrote in the post with the meaning of each one of the letters , you can create a mantra that you use for yourself to tune your vibration or also to sing to the water that you are putting in the seats that we were sewing from yesterday for the entire month. So just for you to know , remember that I say the vibration for today is whatever.

So each one of those vibrations are made with this language , with the meaning of this language. So we are going through all the vibrations nine times. We started , we started almost one year and there are 36 consonants that peat nine times. So it would be throughout the entire year the 360 days that we are going to that we are repeating this alphabet with the meanings.

And the affirmation , the statement that we made every day that we say , I am this or that is the meaning of that vibration of that sound in that language. So I am going to do this now so you have the letters organized because in the blog maybe you were confusing and I will pronounce them. I want to explain what they mean. I will explain the sound.

So if you want to know what they mean , you have to go and read the blog in the bottom with I explain it. So now you have it registered here then you can just stop the image. So nine vowels and each vowel will have four consonants. It does n't mean that this vowel can be only with those consonants , it 's just an organization of the language.

So we can divide it and we have the first three will go to the spiritual level , this one , the soul level and this one the physical level. So each one of these groups will be related with one sound which is the breathing. The first one is inhalation. The second one hold and the third one excavation.

So the names in the Thompson times to these three groups were called ham , ham. So these are not letters , these are sounds. So do n't look for the letters that your name has looked for the sound that they have. Each one of these letters will be one thing that will go through a process that we call expression , experimentation , integration , and transcendence.

So this is their organization that I spoke about in the blog. I will read it so pay attention. La Allah. Ah uh 1.

Sir. Bra. Bra. Bra.

1. Ha. Ha. Bra.

Yeah. Bra. Bra. Bra.

And. Bra. Bra. Z. Oh.

Sir. Sir. Sir. Oh.

Sir. Bra. Bra. Bra.

Bra. Ha. Ha. Bra.

Bra. Bra. 裝� can hear it again and I know the sounds. The idea is not for you to speak the language , of course.

You are not learning the language. What you are having is just the idea of the vibration , how to be able to share it with mantra in the singing. Just to have it. So , these letters were the ones used in this in the Nile to manifest the ideas into matter by sound and singing.

So , I guess that I thought that today would be nice to explain it here. Let 's go to the information for today. What? Why?

The statement for today is I am the origin of dimensions. Why is that? Because why? The letter , what?

It means origin and the , I mean the consciousness that opens in other dimensions. The code for today is the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean in the Pacific Ocean has all the islands from the Mariana 's islands up to Hawaii. Galapagos , Rabbani , Eastern , Polynesia , Fiji , Samoa , and all the other islands and adults that are in the area.

It is the biggest mass of water of the world contained between oceania , both Americas and Antarctica. Implications the portals that allowed information of heaven to descend to earth. Let 's go to the element. Let 's go to the element.

The element is the ocean. I take a deep breath and become aware of the space around me and the body that I inhabit. I use my imagination to perceive this space around me , become a deep dark space. In which I am levitating.

I start to move myself , my body , stretch and like dancing , touch in the air , the space around. Trying to reach the most comfortable position as I move. I start to hug my legs. In a meta position.

I turn myself into a seed , levitating this space. I recognize within me the potentials of the universe , the source , the power of the entire cosmos. For I am a seed of the tree of life of the snow which the cosmic tree lives in me. I am a deep-hand , my own intention to transform myself into another tree.

I observe the ray of light coming from above all over my body. I enter drop of water and light and falls my head being absorbed by my brain , my eyes , my ears. I am a deep-hand , my own intention to transform myself into another tree. I am a deep-hand , my own intention to transform myself into another tree.

I feel the potential inside of me , activating and rising up , and I use my hands to go above and expand on the height of my eyes. I turn my ears into little leaves , expanding outside. I go up with my hands on the sides. I start slowly open my arms and legs like two continents.

I see it , letting the roots go down through the feet and the leaves go up through the hands. I expand my arms as branches , my fingers as thousands of leaves and flowers. I extend my legs down , lay the root of this tree that I am. I feel myself resounding with the singing of the birds , the blowing of the wind.

I recognize myself resounding with everything. I recognize my singing of the birds , the blowing of the wind. I recognize my singing that I am the origin of the dimensions. I have all the dimensions in this tree of the universe.

I am the origin of the dimensions. I have the meaning to get it breath and recognize my hand by hand by hand. I take a deep breath and each one at some time come back here and now. I am the origin of the dimensions.

I am the origin of the dimensions. Thank you everybody for being here with me another day and see you tomorrow.
