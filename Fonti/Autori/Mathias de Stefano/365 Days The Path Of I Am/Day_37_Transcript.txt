good morning good evening good night to everyone
today i i i forgot the the mic for sure next month i will forget about the camera i don't know i know
maybe it's being hard the list of virgo i know for all the spiritual people working for the consciousness diego is very difficult
is nothing compared with capricorn
just wait for it
let's see
january goes for sure
will be a very strong year uh in every sense
let's begin today with our issue
is the root chakra in the mental uh the mind week
i i hope you you were able to to read the blog today um i know it's too much
um my intention was to write just a paragraph uh each day
month
um suddenly i can stop
so it's long sorry i i was trying to explain something
i am still waiting for the sign for the signal waiting for the wi-fi
i i guess
each day would be like like worst
each day
ha
goes on i forget even more things
it's like
as you see i i have no idea
i'm going to say i don't prepare anything
um we were talking about attributes
the two parts of it
are the weakness
the strength
we have
the image
i shared today in the blog i guess helps a lot to understand
we can get the idea of
are our strengths
our weakness
um
the image is related to the spectrum of light going through the space
um
this reality is moving like a wave the long longitudinal longitudinal it says wave at length wave length of wave thank you uh longitude or length of weight
why is important to understand
um spectrum of light
this um uh length wave or yeah
length wave
the importance of it is to realize
everything
exists is basically light
everything
moves through um the space
creates energy it's basically built by photons
are the particles the main particle of light
these photons are the energy
makes the atoms move
that creates everything through the
magnetism
this vibration
that creates everything um
creates every atom every molecule everything has photons
the photons goes through it basically creates us
we are light
to understand
everything
creates us basically is made of light helps us change the idea of
enlightenment means we in
kind of path usually are willing to get enlighted or to find the illumination
we are light
light goes through us
we should not go
look for the enlightenment we just have to go in the same vibration
waves of the light to see the enlightenment
basically the reason
we don't find illumination
we cannot reach enlightenment is basically
we are not balanced with the vibration of the light we are
dissonant to
wave
we cannot see it we cannot perceive it basically we should not make a path outside to find enlightenment
we have to make the path within to balance myself
so get enlighted
find the light one of the key words to understand
process of
to do it is the word frequency
here we have some misunderstanding about
frequency means
we usually think
when we speak about frequency we are talking about energy or the vibration we make
mistake
we kind of say the frequency of music the frequency of of my energy i am vibrating
frequency
we usually made a mistake believing
that means the vibration
it's not bad in order to understand
the frequency works we have to go to a short sentence
maybe makes the summary of everything
is
frequently you do
action in
sentence
frequently is talking about the aspect of
frequency means frequency doesn't mean vibration frequency means the period of time
you need in a process to get to the other point that's
we say frequency of time
frequent you do
that period of time happens
the process of vibration
that's
we misunderstand the concept
we could say
by vibration is space
frequency is time do you see the difference
just picture
image the frequency would be like
wave moving constantly
picture
when you have a wave like in an ocean like in the sea okay the lower one is having all the the strength the pressure to push the one up to move forward okay
when it goes up the one
is
down pushes the wave into
direction
would be like um inner sea inner inners
do you say it in english inertia okay i would say later um it is pushing okay inertia okay um
imagine
the c is
vibration
the c is like the c is a space something physical each time
one goes down press the other
the upper one can move forward
this is
this vibration is constant to understand the frequency we would have to picture the tides of the sea
imagine
the tides are those
goes to the beach
go down go backs again
once again goes back again once
again once
again to the beach
then to the sea
tide has a period of time between each other
we can count in the movement of the waves if i have a very low c a very quiet c the vibration would be very soft
imagine
when you have
like
is the wave okay if it's a column c you would see
the movement will be very soft
when
wave is moving pushing the others down the other one will take a
to rise up
then goes down again very slow
it will take a long time okay to make the process
imagine
of course the c yeah the c is uh the vibration
this doesn't matter
it moves is vibration okay
if i if i to to measure the frequency
i have to say
i have to do is to kind of count
many seconds i can count to uh from the moment
one starts to go down
this one starts to go up
for example i can count one two three four
then it starts again going down one two three four
all
process gives me the idea
each four seconds the cycle will be repeated
the frequency of my vibration would be each four seconds okay
this is the difference between vibration
frequency frequencies time vibration is space imagine
if the vibration rise if
is more vibration more vibration each time more
what happened is
the frequency starts to be shorter okay i don't have time to count
so it's
fast
i cannot keep counting
it's very fast
this is
we call low frequency low frequency is going too slow as shorter it gets the period of of of the waves the frequency will be more high
we have high high frequency
low frequency or medium frequency
because time
space are related to each other as one
is
we also say low vibration medium vibration or high vibration
uh we will have to understand
both of them act in a different way in kind of a different way do you remember
in another video i explained about these different universes one red the other one is orange
we have these different realities the meaning of
is
each one of them will have its own reality
they all will be different
all of them are all together in the same length of um wave wavelength once you got
idea just try to picture
you say you have to rise your vibration
you could go into another dimension
this is a kind of mistaken concept
it means to raise your frequency to your vibration to go into another um into another dimension is not to leave
dimension to go into another one
that you know the concept of
vibration works you just have to know
in order to change your dimension you just need to vibrate faster
when you vibrate faster the frequency starts to be shorter
you are able to see something different a new reality of yourself
this is kind of like saying um i want to i want to see the gamma rays or the infrared rays i cannot do it i'm not prepared for
unless i start to vibrate in the same frequency as them
is
there is no other dimensions apart from ours the only thing
exists is just one wave of vibration in
we all are vibrating in different time frames of frequency
this is
we also say
time
space are relative uh
are happening right
because
is not like saying the past has happened
past is just a low vibration
you cannot see it you cannot touch it
the future is
fast the vibration is like like
that i cannot even perceive it
now let's go to the tiny part
speck of frequency
we can see the one we call present
tiny part allows us to see different aspects through different frequencies
do we see
this part
part of the frequency we see it like a rainbow in our body we see the rainbow projected
as the the chakras
what are the chakras the chakras are just the expression of a whole wave
can be expressed
in
part the vibration is
medium
allows the vibration of the atoms to stabilize
to be kind of in balance
they has the appearance of matter
that's
we exist
we are just a projection of light the only reason
we exist physically is
through the vibration in our spectrum of light the atoms instead of being vibrating like
they started to calibrate
balance
we can see it we can see us
touch us just
the atoms are in order
now in
tiny aspect of light we have 12 waves
let's remember
we are in in
coming from a very low vibration
are like
the medium
then the higher one
already cares
we are in the middle we have
in
spectrum of vibration the experience of 12 12 chakras 12 waves of vibration
um each one of them are located in our body like the seven chakras within our body
the two in the legs
nine
the other one irradiating through the skin
the other one below our feet
the other one up on our head
we have 12 chakras in our spectrum remember
these 12 chakras will have 12 notes
also 12 colors
remember
each one of these chakras is a wave
now picture
that
wave
is coming okay rise up
as the upper chakra the one over a head
then starts to go down
at the moment it goes down it's pushing
rising up the crown chakra
when the crown chakra goes down the low vibration of the crown chakra starts to rise the third eye
then it goes down again
the low energy of the third eye makes up the vibration of the throat
so on you got the picture all the waves
means
our self our being is vibrating
symphony let's talk about the unconscious way of vibrating okay
if i am unaware of myself if i am unconscious if i start to vibrate faster
faster
i do is
i i am not able to do any process
i stress myself okay
i cannot manifest anything
i'm
fast one of the clues to understand these in our own lives is
we project constantly in the future
we are not uh being able to manifest anything in the present
if we through unconscious vibrate very low
the process to take the time
you need to get a process would take years okay
it's very slow
you usually are related to the past
you are always living constantly in the same way of the past
you're constantly saying like oh
it was better or
happened to me was terrible always thinking in the past
in order to normally live in balance
i have to do is not to cut the past
the future
i have to do is to realize
the energy
is coming from the past is part of the wave
i need to use in order to start to balance
to balance myself calibrate myself in order to be aligned with the future energy is a continuum
in order to be conscious
i have to do is to recognize my past the energy
comes to me recognize my present
then to put myself a goal in the future
we have seen all
so let's go again to the 12th in
specific moment
one of the main things
i have to do to understand
is first to analyze in
aspect of my life these chakras are in the top of the wave
would be my strength
which ones in the low part of the wave
would be my weakness
the image would be
i recognize the strength in the top of
wave or the hill
um i can see everything i can see every everything from above
when i have strength i can see
say
is the truth
i am higher
so i see everything
if i go down i'm in the valley
through the valley i only see these mountains around i cannot see perfectly
is happening
i am weak
i don't know
to do let's picture as if they are mountains okay these things mountains
valleys we usually want to stay on the top of the mountain
it's the one you have clarity
you don't have nothing to eat you cannot make grow anything
in order to get food you have to go down the hill pick up food
come back again to the top nobody
wants to stay on the top of the mountain look into everything
i can see everything will be able to survive
they don't have anything to to eat i have to make the effort to go down
this is the effort
we used to call the depression going down to
valley the depression is the act
we take in order to grab all the things
we need in order to have success on the top of the hill the biggest conflict
we have in
movement is
we go down the hill or going up the hill not knowing anything of
i am doing
if i have no idea
i'm doing
the next time
i'm trying to go up the hill i will be like weird
you wouldn't have any idea of
why did i came
why did i come
so suddenly i started to fight against going down the hill to going to the valley i don't want to go down anymore
this concept is like trying constantly to make us try to be happy
that's
we call the pursuit of happiness
trying to do
is like trying to jump from one top of the hill to the other without food without energy the thing
that we need to do is to go down the hill running
grabbing all
we need
with
impulse to go up the hill the strength
we have going down faster makes us go up faster too
this
this
we recognizing ourselves like our strength
our weakness are part of the movement of the wave
this is
when we go down the valley
we become consciousness we shouldn't try to escape from
reality
we have to do is to try to think about
have be
what have we come to look for
what do we need to find
you go
you do the inner process the uh
if you ever feel sad or tired with
and just can't anymore
you get into depression you shouldn't stop it you shouldn't stop
and say no i can't feel
i have to be happy no with consciousness you just sit down you just lay down your bed
just allow yourself to feel
and try to just look within
are you looking for
if you feel
energy
situation of weakness is
you have a lack of something
you need to find
something
the only way you can do it is by allowing you to feel into the depth
energy the people
are suffering from a very heavy depression constantly is
they have been their whole life or even through generations to stop
not to think about
they needed they weren't they were they were trying to hide their needs to be stronger if you wouldn't if all your history was trying to avoid
reality
suddenly you the last one have to go down the hill very fast the fortaleza
in order to be able to balance
to calibrate all these waves
we are first you need to identify
are your strength
where are your weakness
this is
the task for today is to write down a list
you can find
are your weakness
which are your strengths don't think about to calibrate
now it's just to identify we will pick
issue again
in the month of libra libra okay the vibration
we are going to work with today is no
the statement for today is i am the emissary of worlds
precisely for these all dimensions
connect us
today we initiate with the new list of 12 concepts
in
case will be related to the the sounds
um the abc of uh the atlantean language
we will talk about the concepts
each letter holds in it
the information of today is the spiritual pattern of m the doors of cosmos open the spirit of consciousness crosses the the threshold threshold uh
delimits internal from external the m sound is the vibration
defines the crossing to the other side pattern the portal between the subconscious
the conscious between the invisible
the visible the vibration
resonates in every cell unifying it to jump together
remember if
is something not clear um remember
i wrote it in the in the blog as always remember we start by doing massage caressing the body remember
we think to the physical body for being the anchor of the spirit in the matter
i focus my breathing allowing the weight of my body to fell down i become aware of the oxygen going to my lungs my heart blood organs
muscles i feel the heat of my body expanding through my skin towards all directions all my magnetical feel starts to feel complete with all
heat
energy from within take a deep breath
think about the i am as a light over your head
feel with your imagination bringing all the energy around towards
light making it irradiate brighter
brighter i allow the light of the i am to come down through my crown third eye throat heart plexus sacrum
then light my root chakra
the genitals i become aware
every one of my strengths
my weakness are all anchored in my root chakra in the genitals as an idea as concepts
just try to recognize those concepts
how they live together in the same spot i become aware bringing the i am
its consciousness to my root chakra
the weakness
strength
i have are just a continuum of a wave
creates who i am i accept these waves
moves everything within me
as i do
i start to pronounce the vibration to create balance
activate these waves no
now as i keep pronouncing the sound i try to feel
the strength
weakness are moving as a sea the waves of the sea quiet
peacefully um
the side take a i breathe very deep i bring the consciousness to
sea
holds every one of the realities of existence i am the emissary of worlds i am the emissary of worlds i am emissary of worlds i am emissary of worlds i take my hands to my heart take a deep breath as i breathe deep i recognize
my strength
my weakness are all of them part of my attributes
all of them creates the energy
moves the waves of who i am i become aware
each one of the waves of the resonance of my frequency connects each one of my chakras they connect each one of my dimensions of my worlds
i am the emissary of the world i am the sailor the messenger between worlds i am emissary of worlds take a deep breath from your heart bring all
consciousness to all your body massaging crazing stretching
yawning
softly i come back
and
opening my eyes
remember
maybe you will start to feel some weird emotions or some different emotions or sensations from all of
because we are beginning to move
information
these waves
what we are doing is to move all the things
were stopped
that's
maybe we can feel some things
we are not supposed to
don't ban yourself from feeling it just allow it
let it go flow
as always thank you for being
every day
as every day see you tomorrow for denise rest a lot
drink a lot of water tomorrow rest
