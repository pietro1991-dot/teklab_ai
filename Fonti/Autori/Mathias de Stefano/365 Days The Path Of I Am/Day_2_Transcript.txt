hi everyone
are you good morning good evening good night welcome to
second day of alignment thank you for joining um i invite you to to to read the last post
i did um related to the uh i can or i am power uh
is related with the whole month uh we are going to do together let's remember
we are in the middle of khan
remember
we are um
we are using descending the energy from the higher levels of consciousness to the earth the letter or sound m means portal
the sound a means consciousness
these two letters creating
sound the basis of our statement
is i am a portal of awareness or the the portal of consciousness as you prefer the task of course is is if you are not doing
with me
we are going to do the meditation
so um you can do it
or later it doesn't matter if you can't see me properly the important thing is
you can hear me
understand me
today the information of today the key of today
we are going to work with is to is the third eye the chakra the third eye is the observation of all the possibilities
i have for them the the main thing uh is
um the third eye represents uh the the projections
i do in to the world
uh also the perceptions
i have from the world
uh we are going to start right
uh to downloading from we were yesterday into the third eye
we start we have to remember
um we are working with the coherent we are not
to open the third eye we are
to align our inner self the inner being if someone starts to open the third eye to see things whatever is not the uh the is not the first uh the most important thing is not the key of
is to center
um that's it
um
i was saying is
um of course
are some people
would say um um i'm afraid or don't open your third eye or be be careful with
but the natural we are
to open our chakras
to open up our perspectives
if we do open it through fear of course the first things
we are going to see is something scary of course
don't be scared just center in yourself okay remember
pills
demons are just projections from the universal mind if i have my mind in balance they doesn't exist see i'm gonna put the music remember
we have to be relaxed um
um you don't have to be specific in any position
the best position to do
is the tetrahedron
this you just relax just be relaxed
that's it don't be very um don't think constantly about if i am in a good position or whatever let yourself go look for your position
remember never like
like laying down um always like
straight
um
relaxed
with the body as you prefer as you feel more comfortable first i'm gonna feel the physical body try to put it comfortable moving every joint
i go into the meditation position i start to remove the body the joints make a massage to the body until i find my proper position as i get relaxed i become aware of my breathing always through the nose inhale
exhale through the nose
i just focus on my breathing going with the oxygen through all my body my i become aware every organ every muscle every bone
i breathe very deep recognizing all my physical body i focus my attention in the part of my body
i feel the most whether it is for pain uncomfortable we're feeling good pleasure i become aware of
part of my body i just bring it into the present i become aware of the oxygen transforming itself into energy through all my body
energy is all the motion
lives in me without judgment i allow myself feel the warm energies in my body the cold energies in my body all the sensations
i have due to the energy the emotions no judgment i bring my attention to the first emotion
i feel right
in my body i recognize it i observe it in
moment without judgment i just take the first thought
crossed through my mind it can be something silly it doesn't matter i hold
idea i give shape to it i recognize it breathe in deep breathe out with my imagination or my physical hands i take these three concepts in front of me i take
part of my body as a sphere i take
emotion judgment as a sphere
i think yeah no judgment i rise the three of them to the height of my third eye with my eyes closed i observe them i recognize
that these three forces today represent my consciousness i take a moment of contemplation to ask myself
these three concepts represents today my consciousness
is patient my contemplation softly with my imagination or my physical hands i take the three of them towards my third eye i take them until i find them in the core of my head take your time take a deep breath contemplate within these three spheres be aware
these three forces are the tools to nourish the third eye artifices
my higher self gave me to work today i become aware of my energy from my higher self over my head i breathe deep allowing it to descend
through my chakra i become aware of
ground checker one by of it very wide open towards every direction
i feel i think i imagine life coming down from the crown chakra towards the three spheres in the core of my head i start to imagine
these spheres start to disappear
to nourish the seed
you have inside your head observe these three spheres of your body your emotion
your mind dissolving until they become one in the seat
is your third eye
feel the light from the ground checker coming down like if it is water pouring watering the seat of the third eye take a deep breath
with all the air inside of me i start to vibrate the sound
activates the portal of my consciousness keep pronouncing it the vibration each time
each breathing feel your right pin inside your brain in your third eye um maybe the vibration is uncomfortable at the beginning in between the eyes look for the position of the sound until you can feel it vibrating the third eye my breathe deep breathe i start to feel the seed of the third eye through my sound
it's opening with a deep blue indigo color i feel i imagine
flower opening towards every direction like a sphere every petal a spheric flower inside my head i become aware
from
flower comes every projection of myself everything
i see rejected in the outside my eyes contemplate flower is observing
i activate the potential of
flower take a deep breath i am the portal of awareness i am the portal of awareness i am the portal of awareness i can i can i become aware right
that everything
i observe in external world is the projection of my inner side i am the portal of awareness i can
now i observe all the flowers
are blossoming along the whole network of consciousness we are all fractals we all are projections of the consciousness softly i carries my forehead my eyes my ears my nose i make a subtle massage to the eyebrows to the ears the cheek
softly i start to careers all my body to the feet to the ground discharging all the statics of the third eye
when i reach the feet i start to make a massage to my body softly i open my eyes i stretch i yawn
i come back
and
welcome everybody to the third eye gracias thank you
