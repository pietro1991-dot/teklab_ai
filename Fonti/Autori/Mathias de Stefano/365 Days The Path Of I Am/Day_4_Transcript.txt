but um remember
each day i go to the pyramids i kind of download the information

it's just for you to have
information

we do every night at
time
remember
everything
we are doing each day you can find it in uh the blog
is yo soy dot red okay red is not the color red in spanish means network
we are already
today to work with the heart
let's go to the information of today remember we are still in the first month
is the first cycle called luck remember
along
whole month related to the constellation of leo
means
we are going to work with the aspect of the i am related to the constellation of leo
is icon the vibration with
we are going to work today in relation with the heart is the vibration me
according to the ancient way of seeing the vibration the m is related with the portal the door
e the sound e
you may say i the sound e is the balance the yeah the balance itself
is
it is related with the door the heart in between the balance
represents the arms
the um hands the statement for today is i am the portal of the heart
the code of the day is the inspiration related to the process of experimentation we have to remember
there are four stages of um four stages of the um of the time
is expression experimentation integration
transcendence each one of these four has a process of three
they themselves have to be expressing these three processes are inspiration contemplation
exhalation
gives us 12 steps
this is
we are going to be working with concepts of 12 a package of 12 concepts
we are going to work along the whole year
the code in english it is inhaling
the pres the process experimentation it says one by one the cosmos decides to leave every perspective turn it it turning it the president
allows it to enjoy every expression generated by experience becoming inspired in the energies
the experience creates
this means
the universe itself starts to create
reality
it it it starts to experience in the present
and
each one of these expressions
it had created remember
that we
for the period the coherence the goal along
whole year is to find a balance in each part of our self the reason
we are doing
bringing the i am into the eye
is
what we are doing is to downloading the information of the the the higher vibration into
world
and
one of the reasons
i'm doing
both spanish
english is
it's better for many people to have
at
at the same moment
also
um
i want is for you to have my vibration
i don't want the subtitles
i need to have the vibration itself that's
i don't have subtitles remember
one of the things
we are doing is download
information to change the energy of ourselves to open something new
of course maybe perhaps you will be feeling some changes
for sure you will be feeling something uncomfortable
um we are trying to take out our to take ourselves out from the comfort zone it's very common um it's very uh normal if you feel something uncomfortable in your body or with more energy than usual or more tired than usual
is
we are worth the changes of our body
of course who is not um used to change in in its daily life of course it would be bothering
let's remember
these are not uh meditation to feel beautiful
connected with the universe
and
on
let's remember
this is a work for alignment
to work with the energy
one of the things
um
what
i am explaining
is
after some of the works
we do suddenly people start to feel like they are they feel like uh like persecuted or with energies
are uh bad or they feel like scare or heavy or whatever uh
they
they say
it's
i am working with the darkness
i want to make
clear
sure uh about
is my job
why some people is feeling
we have to remember
everything
we are doing is to change the perception of
we see the universe
to change ourselves of course
when we are working with
it take us outside of the feeling
that we from the feeling we believe is being okay
this is showing us in the outside as a projection everything
we have within
everything
like the fears hate everything
was within like trapped they go away they go outside
this is
after an energetic work a lot of darkness
was inside comes out
this is
we interpreted
outside
is something dark we have to remember
we are
for the i am
working with
we have to acknowledge
we are just the reflection of one tiny particle
there is nothing outside we don't create first
we have to remember
the perception
we have from the outside are exactly
my perception
it is my level of acknowledging my level of vibration
allows me to see
so if i start to feel something negative it's
in my vibration in my reality was already
so
is
we don't have to take all the energy
i think it's bad to the outside
get rid of it
we have to do is to watch it observe it contemplate it
understand
it is
and
am i looking at it
i understand
i integrate
darkness as a part of myself
i am not scared anymore
i gave it a purpose
is something
is very important to understand in order to see
we understand the world we have to remember
nothing
no one can hurt you unless you allow it to hurt you
recognizement
we have to understand
because we are going
to the core
all of
go through let's uh sit in a comfortable position remember
the best position is like a tetrahedron
um it's just a suggestion it's not um it's not obligated to sit like
the most important thing is
we are seated like
with the spine straight
our head pointed to the sky
we look for a comfortable position as you feel more comfortable your hands your arms just let your body guide you to be comfortable someone is asking if
is a limit of age to do
uh
is no age to do these alignments
only if
other person ask for it
want to do it don't force anyone to do
unless they ask first
um whoever ever just joined us joining
um right
and hadn't do the other ones i just recommend to take five minutes to just think about the other ones
you didn't do
all together in just five minutes just say the alignments the mantras
that's it
then we keep moving let's begin as always we begin doing a massage to the body parasite above each part of it
we have to remember
touching the body
is to let the body know
we honor it
that we are doing
for it downloading
information begin to relax my body just pushing your body slowly into a comfortable position relaxing your arms your legs your hands breathe in through the nose breathe out through the nose very soft
strong no strength like if i am smelling a perfume i just focus on my breathing breathe deep i close my eyes stop writing i just focus on myself i become aware of my whole body i go with the air the oxygen from the lungs to the heart through all the blood towards each muscle each organ i recognize
part of my body right
is feeling more pain is feel uncomfortable or pleasure no judgement i just picture

part of my body i visualize its forms its limits i breathe very deep
observing it i recognize right
in my body all the parts

the parts with more heart are places with a lot of energy
