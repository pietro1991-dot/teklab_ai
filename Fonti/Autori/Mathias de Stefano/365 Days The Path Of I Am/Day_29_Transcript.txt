hi good morning good evening good night welcome to the day off the feet today I have my eyes very tired
if you see me do it like
is just
of
I hope it was um it was a good walk yesterday to move the knees properly
to connect with the mom
dad traumas
as the arm said today let's go step by step
we have too many things to process to understand um to assimilate it's just all like uh
do you say a matter of getting the Rhythm
today tomorrow is the last day of the first month
we have been working
uh today is the last physical aspect
is the feet
um
we will work the constancy
constancy is something
I must say
I don't have I don't know
it is for sure we share
with many of you um
today
I was talking with the higher self
writing I kind of got
is my lack of constancy for sure
is something
we can relate um
we can relate with um the uh the personal aspects each one is different
this is something
it has been happening for the whole Humanity not just for a few people
one of the reasons
this is a global thing
not not only personal is
now in our society we have built our reality thinking constantly in the future trying to um picture
the future is going to be trying to live the future trying to build the future constantly
we live more in the future trying to change every day as much as possible
not being in the present
fact
we have as a society right
of looking forward constantly
living in the future is something
shows us
we forgot
to stay in the press
how to live the present
here we have a paradox
is if I don't think in the future I cannot build the future
I cannot picture it
um if I don't leave the present neither I can build a future
I don't have the anchor to do
in order to build to create realities we don't even have to live in the future nor live in the past
neither to live in the present
this is something
the higher self wrote today in such way
was to have a
do you say
intoxication in English um detox yeah to have a detox of um time
for me was a fun concept it was a great concept um to to picture um our problem with time in our society
we used to do is to think constantly
to build future to create future to live the future
we forget to leave the present
we are still caring the past the heavier of the best
also
concept of time makes us believe
we need to leave the past in order to create future
when the I am said
we need to review the concept of time to get a detox of time
it meant was to transform our idea
we are heading to the Future
he was saying was
we are not moving through time the time moves through us we are fixed in just one spot
time moves like the waves in the sea
he was saying is
we are not we should not go to anywhere we should not go anywhere
we have to do is to focus Where We Are in the perception of the time
we receive
means
what we have to do is to observe very carefully in our spot all the things
go through us from the past the present on the future
this we can translate it like to be in just one spot
at the same time to be in any time
everywhere at the same moment um
the concept
represents to be in all times in just one spot is all of the times being in just one spot
the concept of
that in Latin is gone
is to be with Stan
is to be
tia
means the concept of
constancy that's the name of
fact the concept
we have today of constancy is to keep doing exactly the same or trying to to to hold just one line to reach a purpose if we set ourselves a purpose
a goal
we try to get into
point
we need to do like exactly the same things in order to accomplish
for a simple example is like for example I want to go on holidays vacations
in order to go to vacations I must be constant in my job
I can earn money to pay for the vacancy the holidays
that's um mostly
we relate to be constant to keep doing the same thing in order to reach a goal
if we picture
the concept of constancy is related to the idea of the West part of the world
is related with work
imagine
for our West civilization to reach something to get something um to be uh we need for in order to get something we need to be constant
it's about to work it's about to keep doing in order to reach a goal
this concept of constancy is not the one
us working for the Consciousness must work with
is the one
we inherit from the western civilization
for example for the Eastern civilizations in the past constancy is more related with observation contemplating the process of um the process the evolution of something from the Western point of view for example we can picture
idea
you want to plant a tree you seed a tree
um
you could get the fruit of the tree
you think about the fruit
that tree is going to give you
you need to be constant um constant to to water the plant every day to take care of the plants
it doesn't get ill from the point of view of the Eastern civilization
is not precisely like
but it's easier to understand these Concepts from the western eastern
let's picture
in eastern civilization there's someone
wants to plant a tree
instead of waiting for the fruit
the Eastern civilization would do is to observe
the tree is growing
is the process okay the process of growing the process of um of relating yourself with the growth of the tree these are the two different concepts of constancy
we can relate with
what the I am was saying was
both of them are related to a concept
is going through time one of the things
the I am was saying is
we need to detox ourselves from the concept of going through time
the thing
he was saying is
we don't have to think
the tree is growing is to think I am the tree the concept of constancy
this
the I am was saying is
not to sit
observe
the tree is growing up not to sit
wait for the tree to give fruits
to become yourself the process of the tree
realize yourself
the tree is growing within you
the ayam was saying is instead of waiting for something to happen
we have to do is to make step by step these things to happen to focus in our daily things as a process of growth
he was saying is
in the moment of
tree growing up
is the whole potential of
that tree was being other trees
the seed
the fruit
also the potential of every fruit
every seed
it is going to create in order to become more trees the concept
um
the I am was trying to talk about is not to do everything
you do in order to reach something in the future
to do everything
you do focusing in
you are doing every day
is the only way in
you can activate the potential of the future the concept is not to think or do our stuff day by day in order to create future to go to the Future to do stuff in the future
in the other hand
we have to do is to realize
that future is within us like the fruit is inside the tree is within us
when you do each day focusing in the present you are activating the potential of the future the concept
it was trying to share is
we should not leave the past behind in order to create future
what we have to do is to use the past Here
Now as an energy to feed the future
is also
and
and the only way to activate it is by the action in the present
that is core
is best present
future altogether stantia being
we call
eternity
is
he meant with a Time detox
what really means constancy is to realize
in every action of the present I am transforming my my past into future
this is
each tiny thing
we are doing day by day is the one building future if we do it through the consciousness foreign
it's important to understand the difference between constancy
present the person is just a concept
tries to explain
precise moment
the present is not the one we have to leave the person is just an anchor sometimes
we hear the expression to leave the present we may think
in order to do
we have to leave the past behind
stop thinking about the future
it's not
is precisely the opposite it's exactly the opposite is to put the three times together in just one moment
remember
when you say I must live in the present you must translate it into no I must leave the eternal constant or the constant eternity I guess
for sure
is a very different concept of the constancy
maybe you expected to work with today I think it's much more like a puzzle instead of a work line
let's see
we go integrating it
let's go to today
is the vibration of the day
the statement of today related to
sound is I am the path of learning
