foreign 
how are you good morning 
good afternoon good evening so another day that we meet here to 
work from the sacrament chakra in the emotional week of Capricorn so related 
to the frustrations so just I have to start with this 
um for the people that were asking because you are new remember that uh it 
doesn't matter if you hadn't seen the ones I did before the videos that I did before you can start today and going on 
so it doesn't matter um I would recommend to see them some other 
moment of course um but um 
it's not necessary to see all the others before in order to catch up with this uh 
videos when we are here so I I think 
there are some things that you were doing about the post and sometimes 
if I don't answer to some of those questions is because I already did in 
some other posts or videos okay so um if you see those videos you or or 
read the post remember that they are like kind of uh episodes or 
um or chapters of a book so you have to to check each one of them 
um to see how the story is going okay that's why I don't repeat many of the 
things unless I think it's needed and um according to this 
also I would say that some of the questions that some people is doing are 
very personal and they were asking me why why haven't you speak about this or 
that well it's impossible to speak about everything so uh the the post 
on the videos explained big pictures of the topics so then you 
can do the intelligent action of 
discerning that information 
to understand it according to your own life and experience 
okay so I it would be impossible to talk about all the issues of the world and 
even more more the personal ones so that's why I try to be 
much more open um so you can adapt 
hmm so I was said 
this thing sometimes frustrates the people 
um when you read something that others are reading uh writing so let's go to the 
topic for today which is frustration which is very capricornian by the way 
is that the the things that I am writing in the blog every day is a conversation between 
I and am and uh this is my 
I and um okay so each one of you has your own 
um so the things that I write 
there is a conversation with my own self so don't expect in my own self the 
answers we are all ourselves I'm just a reflection 
to show you that you can also have the same conversations with your own 
um with your own being uh so 
I am encouraging you to do exactly the same and the way you do it is exactly 
the same as I do it just write down the question and don't expect to understand 
the answer just start to write and write and write and write and don't touch it just don't think 
about it and sometimes could be difficult at first but then it would be easier okay 
so frustration we are surrounded by frustration today 
in our lives because we are constantly expecting for things 
to happen and they don't happen 
so here comes the frustration so frustration comes from the word Frau 
is also the word that that originates fraud so when someone is a fraud 
um when someone is a fraud is uh or something is a fraud is 
something that you expected to be different and suddenly you realize that it's not 
that um or you're expected for it to be 
something and suddenly you figure out that it was something different okay 
um so when you discover that 
that something is the opposite or quite different from what you expected 
you can see that that a cheating uh deception 
so that deception is what we call emotionally frustration 
which is the aspect of the fraud the fraud 
so we have two different point of views of of a fraud 
we can see it from the outside or see it from the inside when we see the perception of the fraud 
from the outside we say we usually say 
um that uh that someone lied to you that someone 
was doing um someone was hiding things from you 
um that uh that is a fraud because 
the because you cannot see what the other 
person was doing so you consider yourself like like frustrated because of someone lying 
to you so you can see that that situation or that person afraid 
um but let's look into the real point of view of this which is 
that is your perception that is what you perceive 
from that situation because normally normally 
you are perceiving the reality everything that 
you perceive that you see is a is a perception so because of this 
defraud is something that you perceive it's not something real outside 
I mean you are the one expecting for things to 
be different so it is all because of you that you see that 
in that way and you couldn't see that coming before because you were expecting 
for something different um 
uh for example usually we say or I've been a lot of people saying that 
um the States had of an election that was a fraud 
um but 
uh the real thing is that there was no 
a fraud in the election the system of the election in the states 
is a fraud and why because everyone accepts the LIE 
that they live in a democracy 
when they never have so uh 
so the fraud is basically because a lot of people is 
holding that lie because you believe in that thing 
let's see from two different point of views so we can see the fraud from two 
different point of views this two point of views is in one side I 
can tell that something is a fraud because when I see it 
I can see that this is not correlative with this 
so so I see the lie that someone was lying 
to me because this when I have been told this is like this and then I discovered the no it was the other way so I can say 
that was a fraud that was a lie hmm 
that's a perception from the external point of view but then I have the internal point of 
view of the fraud which is I refuse to accept what I see because 
according to my belief that is not what I expected 
so I consider that a fraud even if it is not just because 
it doesn't match us with what with my perception you know what I mean 
so these are two different point of views of a fraud the external one and internal one 
so the internal one is the most important one because everything is basically from the 
inside from within and remember that it tries to protect 
you so the brain will always try to say I am 
right and will never say you are right because the brain tries to survive 
so now from now on I must say 
I don't care if there was a fraud in the states I 
don't care if this was a fraud in a company in economics I don't care really 
because what I really care is why why we have created a fraud in the first 
place and the reason why we create that is because of our own perception of what is 
fraud we are the first fraud of all 
because we are the ones holding the system of 
living through beliefs that are a fraud 
is from our inner point of view 
so the only way a fraud becomes systemic in a 
in a civilization in a society is because the individuals 
are the founding themselves 
so why a person defrauds 
itself why it's just because of the need of 
survival why we 
decept commit deception on ourselves 
all the time we cheat to ourselves 
and that's because we are afraid to die to not exist anymore 
the greatest hoax of Our Lives 
our expectations our whole life is built based on 
expectations and why is that because 
we create this system to try to 
to reach something that is not real so we commit these hoax to ourselves 
in order to keep going to survive 
that's the biggest fraud of all that we do to ourselves 
so what happens what happened when 
you you arrived to the point 
to understand that your expectation is not true and suddenly the things you 
were expecting for it just doesn't 
come to happen they just 
don't exist or you can do anything 
what happens in that moment well the fraud you were living in 
becomes an emotion that you call frustration 
the frustration is the emotion that shows me that I was living 
in an illusion of expecting something from my self hoax 
my own created hosts 
every social and cultural hoax and fraud 
that generates frustration 
is born in the moment is born in the need of every individual 
to believe in something 
so if anyone here between all of you 
Believes In Me in what I say 
suddenly someday he will come up 
that I will be a deception for you 
that I will be a fraud for you 
and not because I am one it's just because 
your expectations 
so everything that we do in our lives 
that we see in our lives we see it through our own beliefs and expectations 
and if those expectations 
are not coming to reality as I expect for them to be 
so I will believe they are 
a lie 
so if I recognize that that was [Music] 
a fraud a lie then I will discover that I have been 
living through a lie and suddenly 
I get frustrated foreign so I just put myself but 
maybe you do it with some people around you some famous people 
Masters aliens I don't know 
you put expectations in maybe something different 
things projects 
and now let's go even further in this 
I cannot even trust my own senses because my five senses 
are just tools that my brain used to interpret the reality outside 
so it's not truth is also so 
a hoax so now think about this what if my sixth 
sense the one that can perceive the universe 
is also another tool to interpret 
that helps my brain to interpret the reality of other dimensions and all 
the other beings the interdimensional beings and Masters 
and lighter ones 
all those people they are also just a perception of my brain 
and they don't re-exist 
everything what my brain interpretates 
anything that my brain interpretates is a hoax 
is a deception 
because everything is an interpretation of the brain 
but it's not the truth 
remember what is a fraud a fraud is something that I expect for it to be in 
one way and it end up to be something different 
that's a fraud from fraus 
foreign so if nothing really exists 
the universal mind what it does in order for things to be able to exist 
it creates a destiny a purpose 
and because of the purpose it starts to create path towards the purpose the 
purpose gives meaning to the creation of the path so the universe doesn't create a path to 
reach and accomplish a purpose in your life no the universe create a purpose so you 
can create your path is the opposite 
the purpose is a deception it's a hoax 
hi is a hoax that helps us 
to be creators to manifest to expand 
and this is why every time that we put our faith 
on accomplishing the purposes a purpose when we get to it we get 
frustrated because it didn't really exist 
so it would be never expected for it to be 
imagine this for example 2012. 
December 21st that was something that was like a date like 
everyone was like oh that day we have been waiting for that date for a long 
time for something to do something because something would happen that day 
yeah what happened that day nothing 
happened anything it was a normal day in the planet nothing happened 
that day that a lot of people 
of the world believing in that date 
got ready in consciousness 
raising its Consciousness for that moment so there was so many people in the world 
connected to their own selves for that moment that it really worked 
but the date it's normal just another day in the calendar 
we have two people in that day 2012 December 12th 
December 21. 
there were some people that when the day arrived they're like 
wow yes it was not important to date 
now I know that I did all of this and I became this 
to be like this in this date so it's not important what was happening in that 
moment it was how I was going to arrive to that date so it was like yes I got it a lot of 
people got it and there was a huge 
amount of people saying I did all of this for nothing 
so they got frustrated for doing all these different things 
through many times and suddenly they got into December 21st 
2012 and nothing they were expecting something for like Hollywood 
nope and this is when a lot of people used to 
say you shouldn't believe in this spiritual spiritual things because 
what happened in 2012 nothing it was a normal day nothing 
really nothing it was the year when the most 
biggest group of people in the world God conscious aware 
so it really happened something foreign 
information today let's say this 
that we as humans have been living through 
expectations our whole life and when we start to listen into the 
truth of the universe we get frustrated because we are expecting 
for a god in the skies to give a meaning to our lives 
but we are the creators we are the ones creating that's why 
today we are in the sacrament chakra day 
there's this expectation of a god 
in the sky to give a meaning to what we are doing here 
to have someone that when we die can tell us welcome home my child 
so we are the creators of everything 
so that Celestial father will be there waiting for me after I die 
if I create him 
we frustrate ourselves because of expectations 
foreign so 
everything that we do is because of expectations 
we expect things from ourselves we expect things from someone in 
Disguise creating the purpose of my own 
we expect for people in the governments to do 
what we are supposed to do we live through expectations 
and that's why we get frustrated so fast 
so I live through expectations so whatever I expect from myself from God 
from a master from the president from an alien 
all these expectations are the ones that frustrated me 
I create them so remember this 
the purpose was only created so we could create 
a path the expectations 
to fulfill this purpose is the designs that the mind in its 
awareness create has different possibilities is 
to manifest the ways to reach that purpose 
but if I attached myself if I had touched myself 
to the expectation or the purpose ahead the only thing that I will find there 
is frustration remember purpose and expectations are 
tools tools not goals 
the only objective objective or objective goal of this universe is 
the creation itself so with this information each one of you 
do whatever you want So I myself have created my own path 
and purposes what I am doing but I know I created this 
in order to do things that I need for myself and that we all share 
okay the vibration for today is beer 
the statement for today is I am the home of The Matrix 
the code for today is path every line of the web 
sorry every Edge in geometry is a different path 
a specific path within the cosmos that relates different projected 
that relates different projected Concepts the key of universe's development is 
hence the transit on these strings of the web making the experience of going through 
them every string vibrates in a different tuning giving vibration color specific form 
making every section unique and and unrepeatable and thus making all of us 
endless apprentices and Masters 
let's go to the alignment
