hi everyone so we are here testing a new place so 
um I would for you to tell me if you are if you are listening 
and how it is I guess it's better signal here 
so um I did as much as possible to have 
light and sound here but we are in the middle of the garden with the trees and in the grass on the grass so 
um let's see what happens today so I hope today is fine because 
yesterday we were in a beautiful place but no signal at all 
so remember that we are in Google constellation and this is today 
we are going to work with the niece in the emotional week 
the issue to discuss today is about identity 
so the issue today uh about identity is also related with what we have spoken 
yesterday about um about denial 
which is this um reality that we have uh 
daily of not accepting um the things outside 
because we want to um keep safe and stable Within 
and the the reason why denial and identity are 
linked together um are because 
um and we accept and we deny in our lives 
uh they create what we are our identity 
so um personality and identity are related 
but they are like different things in the construction of the self of the 
being identity would be the ability to recognize the power of the self to 
recognize this is me this is what I am and personality would be what we express 
into the outside and how the people observe and interpret and interpreted 
what we are so everything that others perceive ourselves aspect of the personality but 
everything that I accept in me or deny in me are part of my identity 
so the importance of identity in our path is because 
um the identity is more related with the with who you are with I am so in order 
to be coherent in the I am we need to build a perfect identity 
so as I said before our identity in order to understand it 
how it how it works we need to realize that the that the identity was created 
by the things that I accepted and the things that I deny in my experience 
through life so we have to understand and picture 
about this is that if the identity is something that has created 
has been created but what I accept and what I deny so everything that I have 
denied in my life is not something away from me but it's something that also involved 
what I am right now so this is why to accept and to 
understand what we are denying is an important step to give in order to 
realize how are we formed we are created Who We Are 
so we are the result of our acceptance of experience and an 
existence and our denial of our existence and experience 
so this is related with the mirrors and how the creation is is worked by mirrors 
so what I accept is what I relate with what I am this is me what I am but 
what I observe in the mirror the opt of it but it's also me 
so the goal would be that um in the creation who I am the only way 
I can see what I am is by watching myself in a mirror so I have to see a 
mirror and I know and so I can analyze each one of the parts that creates me 
what I am but even though I can see every detail 
of what I am in the mirror the image would be the opposite of My reality 
so the reason why it worked like here is because 
um the universe is trying to evolve so the only way it can evolve is if myself 
I can see myself in the mirror in the opposite in that 
other energy uh in front so I can see what I have to work with the only way I 
can evolve is by is by acknowledging everything that I had created that I 
have denied so basically everything that is going to help me to evolve and to change in my 
life to transform myself in in my life is um it's just that what I am denying 
because is the hard work the things that I have to integrate to transcend so this is why I need to look myself in 
my opposite in order to understand what um I have been protecting and I have 
been denied so basically what we used to do is to 
willing to become something but uh what we do is to delay the tool 
that will help me to transcend myself to become that something so that is the key of the opposite the 
other one so to understand let's picture like the 
origin of the universe like exploding so it creates a wave of energy and this 
wave we can see it like this like this wave so the 
movement of this wave will create energy that we had already looking with this 
movement with this movement it's going to happen is that 
the energy will create light it will create all the colors and all 
the realities that we can see these waves of energy will create the light 
and the light will create the shapes and that shapes are the ones that we have here in this reality 
so the reason why the wave exists the one that goes up and shows me everything 
about the the situation and to be aware of everything and the one I'm willing to 
achieve only exist due to the 
one below the opposite the push of this energy below is the one 
that allows the one the other one to go up so basically this movement of up and 
down a wave is the one that allows the existence of the different vibrations 
the different lights and colors different shapes the Opposites are the only thing that 
creates the movement it can also say that the the part going 
up we call it acceptance and the part going down we call it denial 
so what shows this that every process of acceptance and denial 
acceptance through all the history both of them and all of them creates 
the wave of vibration so we could say that the self the being 
is that concept that is created by all these things that accept and deny accept 
and deny accept and deny this is why we cannot escape from what 
we deny inevitably the 
the things that we deny are going to be show up in our last big 
those are the only ones that push me forward to move and to accept who I am 
what we can identify about this is that um everything in the reality is like a 
chain that just copy the same Parts like up down up down up 
down like copy positive negative positive negative acceptance denial acceptance 
denial constantly the same even receive give and receive 
all the time we repeat constantly everything so this is what it means that 
everything is like a cycle where everything happens exactly the same but 
in different levels of consciousness or awareness 
so this is us that we really are doing is that the being what it really does is 
to copy and paste copy and paste constantly the same cycle okay so this 
self this entity is um 
is copying the same system once and again 
In etymology the being constantly the same in Latin 
we say edem and the self the the being we say and and 
ends so if you put both together you have 
identity identity is the being 
that repeats constantly itself and always is the same so this is why when we talk about 
identity we are talking about what I am constantly always 
what identifies me what makes me know what I am 
who I am we can see that in nature biology is 
constantly copying and pasting copying paste com copy paste copy paste of 
everything in the DNA the cells and everything it's copying information 
so basically for the universe there is no different individuals 
there is only one being that is always the same that the only thing that he is 
doing is copy paste copy paste copy paste basically 
um in this copy and paste sometimes we have some mistakes and those mistakes and errors that we have in the copy is 
what we call diversity but biologically 
we are all always just one being always 
what I'm trying to see is that um the identity is not only about who I am 
now it's about all the information that I have within from everyone 
that are in My DNA or my history 
this is when we make the difference between identity and personality identity is the result I am the result 
of something that has been copy and paste copy and paste 
and the personality is that thing that this individual is showing from itself 
to the world so basically what I have done with this is to just destroy the identity of of 
all the people from the world and the reason is because we start to 
realize that we are a Continuum we are not separated separation is just a perception but it's 
not a reality so this is why when we start to speak about the I am it's not that we are 
speaking about I am Matthias is about I am this entity 
so this brings us the idea that changed the concept of the philosophical concept 
of just look within you and don't pay attention to what is outside 
just look inside so why because from the point of view of 
the universe there is no outside the outside is also part of me 
do you remember the mirrors everyone that we meet in the world every 
person are copies so they are different identities 
Eden the same so what mean that 
everything that I cannot observe from my own perspective in the inside I will 
contemplate it in the outside through other people 
we come back again to the same concept of uh all of them are my mirrors 
but I am also a mirror of all of them 
so there are two different path of the uh of the Consciousness that we 
have to accomplish so the first step or the first path would be that acknowledging I am part of 
everything I have to watch outside and to understand all the parts that I am not 
watching in myself that I had projected outside the next step to that 
is in that moment to go back to myself watch within and start to see what I had 
within so I can find the balance usually what usually the reason why we 
start in the opposite side of the process is because the spiritual world we used to 
say that everything that is outside is not real so we have to understand the projections the projections that we have 
done from inside so we have to go Within but that's not the way in which is 
useful in the third dimension because we have this existence now 
so this is why I have to understand first what is outside around me 
so I can then go in the inside and to process that 
information to understand how I assimilate all that information 
so basically the base of all this is to understand that identity means that everything is 
equal that everything is a copy so everything that is outside is a copy from what is inside 
basically to watch outside and to watch inside it's the same but from different 
perspectives so to understand this is that we usually 
do this from the unconscious or the conscious so from the unconscious way 
what we start to think is that everything that is outside doesn't exist because everything that exists is inside 
but it's not like that and why it's not like that because 
uh everything that is outside is not separated from me I am the same thing I am connected to 
everything so it's not separated so the process of unconscious of this is to believe that we are 
separated and that everything that is outside is different from the inside 
so the conscious way would be to analyze the external 
by understanding that that's a process in the internal 
today I give a easy example to understand how we usually do this 
so imagine that that the reality is like a home where you live and maybe you have people living in the 
home with you family or you invite people to your house 
so as as much people you have in your house or you invite to your house 
um we'll leave you more stuff to you not only emotionally 
but also I'm talking about garbage and 
dust so basically they leave dust dust is 
dead cells so it's the skin that is dying so 
um it creates dust in home so basically if I don't realize that I 
have to clean the house I don't realize that as many people I invite the most 
dust I will have in the ground so I will I I will believe him in 
a lot of garbage or dust when you become a spiritual 
before you look into the dust in your floor what you do is basically 
boom basically what what you do is to create an altar for the broom 
so basically what we do is to honor this solution 
but we don't go to the cause of the problem and this is how we keep all the garbage 
and the Dust under the carpet the carpet we call it subconscious 
so family we live in this house with a family and family is living a lot of dust that we call Karma 
it's genetics it's dead cells 
so um by making an altar to the um I'm not cleaning the problem I'm not 
realizing about the problem I have to go and to what do you say 
brush sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet 
so in our knees we are bringing all the dust from all 
the generations so just by saying 
um I don't care about anything else I will just be myself 
focus in my identity I am I am just 
I am just building an altar to the group 
so this is why what we have to do is to acknowledge from where 
I took all the Dust from the side of all those 
um other identical uh beings around me 
so this is why the task for today is to make a list 
of the emotions and feelings with which I relate all the people the 
family that lives with me in uh conceptual concept house 
so the question would be what are the emotions and feelings 
with which I request each one of my uh familiars 
relate relatives so there I put Mom Dad 
Uncle Auntie grandma grandpa 
and I'm talking about the family because by genetics are the closest so it's more 
easy to identify foreign so basically what I'm doing with 
this is to recognize all the tools that I usually see in others 
that I also have within that but that I wasn't seen that it wasn't observing 
hmm so also brothers sisters Sons daughters 
the ones that died also of each one of them 
I hope you got it and if you didn't so watch it again 
so let's do the alignment the vibration we are going to use today is who 
the statement is I am the spark that propels 
the spiritual code of the spiritual pattern of today is 
after the energy has been consumed only rest remains 
neutrality the calibration of all forces returning 
within to the dream the raw sound like the purring 
sound of filling to lines who when our quiet and templined 
calibrate the world around them with the engine of the Divine dream 
thus the spirit harmonic comes back to itself 
to be able to Enlighten its inner being
