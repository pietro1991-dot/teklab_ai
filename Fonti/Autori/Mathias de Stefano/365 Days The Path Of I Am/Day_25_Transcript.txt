hey everyone
are you good morning good evening good night hope i'm speaking spanish slowly for those who doesn't speak spanish
under spanish
i hope i speak in english in such a way
people
doesn't speak english
understand english can't can get it
of course
i am using um i am using these two languages english
spanish
of course they are the most useful
spoken in the world
if i would have to speak at least five languages translating everything it would be horrible
a mess for me
thank you very much for um to all of those who are following every day
they speak other languages
let's begin with today
um today
day is related um with the pancreas with the gland of pancreas
this gland is the is related with the plexus
in one
um produces the glucose
is the main um fuel for the energy in our body
in such a way we can say
this gland is the one in charge of of giving strength to to our to our body to the self to the i am
one of the things of
gland is to try to make a harmony in everything
that everything every organ has the energy necessary to keep going one of the things
we have to understand from
um from
gland is
it receives everything
we inherit
we eat
then uh it's processed by the stomach liver everything the digestive system
all together with the pancreas they are spread to um to the body as energy
it's not only about the physical meals
we have the energy
also it's an emotional energy not only
we eat the information by
gland to the body
also
we feel the emotions we receive they are also spread from
gland
all
information
we receive has the goal to become the main basement for the i am for the self for us to feel with strength
integrated with integrity is
gland
helps the i am to be united
to process
information
everything
we receive from the outside the emotions people come to us through the links
we have in our plexus independent crest
this is
everything
we feel for others
that others feels for us for me is received
controlled by the pancreas
is
when we feel something for some we feel it in the pancreas whatever it is good or bad
those sentences
maybe um can make arrest me a summary of
what i explained are i feel butterflies in my stomach in my belly or i feel hollow i feel empty in my stomach
these two sentences are kind of a summary of
our plexus feels linked with other people
we could say
i am by definition the result of
i feel from the environment
this is
the pancreas in a good way can produce insulin
um the glucose of the
it it creates energy in the body or also
it can do is to feel low in in
glucose
and
insulin
so uh it starts to get ill every problem
we may have in the pancreas or around the pancreas is related with the emotions
we feel the most common conflict
we may have is
we have a lack of love
that creates a problem in in the pancreas
it's a lack of energy um yeah a lack of energy a lack of emotion
one of the things
we have to understand from chris is
we exist
we are
of these links
one of the things
i wrote today in the blog is
we used to think to believe
the
the goal
we have in relation with the plexus is to love ourselves not to depend from others
to feel to fill up the voids
we have with them with our own love
it's not like
precisely we need to understand
we exist
of the relationships we have in between each one of us
this is
everything in nature everything in nature has something to give
something
they need
this is a give
receive okay constantly the universe doesn't see two different things
are exchanging things or information the universe doesn't see separate things exchanging the university sees just one being flowing okay flowing constantly
sharing information in the same body
one of the things
the am the i am explained today was
we as humans are used to think most in
we need
when we are lack of
what we have
when we start to think about
we need we don't have it
we lose a lot of energy
when we enlighten
we have we give to the others
we have naturally the other ones
have
we need will match with us
they can see it
we have to understand is
we don't have to fill up the gaps we don't have to fill up the uh the voids
we have within
we have to is to give a purpose to
we have
naturally gaps will get filled with something else one of the things
we must understand in order to change our consciousness to make a transformation from ourselves is to realize
we we don't lack of anything we don't have a lack of anything we have everything
we are not paying attention to
everything
what we have to do is to open ourselves in service
when we start to become to do the service naturally
we need will come
when we are waiting to receive something we need in order to do something we want that's the greatest mistake we are doing
nothing in nature will give you anything unless you move
otherwise you're not useful for nature
is
in all the ancient cultures
relate
religions they say to be in service to others to serve to others
we have created idea
to be in service to others is like slavery not an exchanging of energy someone made the question
is useful to explain something
is the law of attraction is
the law of attraction no
we have a problem with the law of attraction
usually
we
we think is i can attract
i want
i want
the problem with i want with willing is
that it emerges from a need not from potentiality just from a need here's an explanation about the law of attraction
what i am explaining is the law of attraction
it's not sleep
the law of attraction the real one is to your potential in service
you start to move your energy
when you start to move you activate an engine
naturally will bring
you need in order to accomplish
you are doing
the path not by being sit down
asking for the universe i want
it will come okay sorry for the law of attraction to work i must set myself in action not in expectation for example sometimes we can for example say i i want to i want to to travel i want to travel very much
if i think in the law of attraction i would say i want a trip i want a trip i will co-create a trip
nothing happens
i say i want a trip
instead of waiting for it i walk
and
i start to do things like asking people about the places
they have been
how they went
and maybe you make a short trip
suddenly you meet someone
tells you about another place
you should know
suddenly they bring you
suddenly you are traveling
that's the magic
this is related with everything with love with work with whatever
we have to understand is
we are like a machine
we need energy to work
we always are in need of something
maybe some other person has the fuel for my machine
in order to my machine to work i need to think
do i have to give to
other person
that other person can give me the fuel
by
i start to move the machine
is
i receive
i need according to my service not
way around i cannot wait to receive
i can start i can start with the service
this is
it's
important
every one of us in a tiny aspect of ours to be in need of to be with some void with the lack of something
that's
makes you
makes everything move if we would have everything
now everything
we need
we are complete
we got it enlightened
that's it um i i was just saying in spanish
um i know
maybe some of you are looking for enlightenment of course
you want to get enlighted um right
but i i would recommend you not to for enlightenment
it's a waste of time
and um i was saying
i am maybe the first the worst guide in spirituality ever
i will explain
the reason
it takes
long to get enlighted is
enlightenment is something
you reach
you accomplish to be in balance accepting everything
you have within
everything
you are
everything
is around you everything
exists
in order to do
i need to learn
to love
enjoy the creation
the thing is
if i am willing to get enlighted to get out of the creation i am doing exactly the op of
enlightenment means
we have to do is to enjoy
we have enjoy
we are love
we have created
then someday maybe you get enlighted
don't try to get enlighted if you are not even able to handle your own emotions
um in order to reach the enlightenment of the self we need first to learn
to forgive our worst enemies to love everyone equally
most of all to learn
love means
is not to want someone is very different
let's go to the pancreas by the moment
to see
we can handle the in
the vibration of today's seal
the statement today is i am i am the path to the center
the center is the place
the path heads to head to
today we change the code of today the information into something very different
are the notes of music
the reason um the reason
we
sharing these codes
information is
um all of them are useful for us to understand with to understand many of the things we are working with okay uh many of the aspects
tools
we are using
the elements not we are not using
information for the alignment
we are using the tools okay
that's
i wanted to share some of
information
uh one of informations are related in groups of 12 is they are related to the month of the year
this is
first they were the 12 chakras
now is the 12 notes
of course each um every 12 days we will change the groups of 12 emissions
today we start with the mention of the note do
is c for english
means in latin may be loosened that's
the poem by paul de jacon in the eighth century starts
um stars
he sings
even him um
do you say him um anthem let's say anthem to saint john the baptist from
the monk gidodarezo took the first syllables to name the seven musical notes in the middle ages became the mirror for phonetic do
is the first one of the seven notes for it is the only scale
has alterations in the anglo-saxon scriptures the numeration was alphabetic naming
note c
note alternates with the lower center chakra the center below being the sound of unity within the earth
