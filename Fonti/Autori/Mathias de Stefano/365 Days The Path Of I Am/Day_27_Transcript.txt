hi everyone good morning good evening good night
another day talking from
in giza cairo egypt
i hope you all are ready for the alignment for today
today our work is related with the physical aspect of the root chakra
would be the genital glands in the male the testicles
in women the um ovary yes
for sure
we speak about the root chakra we all agree
we are talking about is about the um the energy of life the our vitality inside um
the problem comes
we try to speak about the physical aspect
is the place
the the information gets physical gets stuck in the matter
the reason
we have these problems with our genitals is
through the history as i wrote today in the blog we were willing to go to the skies to the heaven
leave the earth the reality
in such a way we were trying to let behind our nature
the animal side
we have in order to become spiritual
to go up
to think
we are superior to the nature
in
willing to go up to the skies
is a kind of um will of living the matter
everything
is related with
um reality
is having been born in
world
this is
from the
do you say in english the
from the belly button down um we have
um we're thinking
thinking
it is
um earthy
worthy um worldly i don't know
to say it um
is better not to oh naval naval never never heard
name naval okay
we um um from the naval we are attached with a militant umbilical cord um to the mother earth
everything
is related with from
point naval or belly bottom whatever below um is not good if you want to be spiritual
is
was the belief we have to be aware
this
belief
in order to uh go to the spiritual reality we need to live the material
the physical reality is something
even us the people
are working for spirituality
consciousness had still in ourselves we believe
in order to
in order to reach the heavens the other dimensions we have to disattach from
reality to live
reality
this is something
we have mistaken um it's not like
really
um the concept of
attachment is not to leave a way
leave
behind
attach is not leaving something is to accept the reality
when you accept the reality it doesn't affect you anymore
you already know
it works
you know
you can change it you realize
it works
so you accept you love the reality
you don't you don't need reality anymore
you don't need reality you are free from reality
that's
attachment it's not living one of the things
we have to do in order to reach
heaven is to love the matter love everything in the matter
we can see its darkness
its light
see the purpose
the magic in all
and suddenly
we love the creation
we start to love
we have created we understand
we have created
we let everything go we feel free from
we love the matter
i don't expect anything from mata
i disattached
it's totally the opposite to
we usually are doing to believe
in order to be enlighted we have to leave away the matter
know in order to to transform our reality into light we need to unconditionally love matter
the only thing
makes you free from something is
you don't expect anything from
something
that's unconditional love
people from the spiritual world
we are doing
and right
is not to work
we could
we could go into the fourth the fifth or the sixth dimension we are doing all
to awake the fourth the fifth
the sixth dimension
and
all those who have come through all the history um doing spirituality usually think
heaven
earth are separate things
that in order to reach the heaven you need to leave the earth
the earth is flying in heaven
we have to understand is
we are not separate from heaven matter is not something different from heaven matter is an expression of heaven
as more we want to go to the heaven the universe will bring us deeper
deeper to earth
this is
each time
we become more spiritual we are each time more um buried
why is
because matter doesn't exist matter is just an expression
a comprehension of mind i'm not speaking about
like imagination
we have to look into the matter
the matter is nothing
you look into the physics the atomic physics you can picture
everything
exists is made of atoms
atoms are 99.99 space there's nothing the other day i was talking with a friend about
these things the the size of atoms
she explained something
i could understand the sites picture
my friend was explaining me
we can take
example with a football ground picture a football ground it's very big a lot of people goes
and picture
rubber
you put it in the center
this is the size of the proton
you have a proton in the center of
big field
around the field of the same size an electron spinning around in the outside of
uh big football crown
in the middle of all
there's nothing just
and a tinier part in the outside
nothing
we have to understand
matter is just a perception that's the size of matter imagine
uh for sure you have heard about
but um some um if you want to put all the matter the real matter of the um eight
do you say in english all the inhabitants of the planet all the humans of the planet like eight point billion i don't know
do you say it
you say it different um
if you put the real matter of every human in the world it is
just
size of matter that's it all of them
all of us
the whole population of the world in matter the rest is just magnetism
space
when we speak about the earth the world
heaven is not real just a perception
is
to live the matter is also to leave the heaven the only difference
the matter has is
is the heaven
distorted it is like a mirror
was broken
so the light of the heaven is watching itself in different images
the light is fractalized
our job is not leaving matter is to balance the matter to set it again in balance in harmony it's just
so
is
in my path
in our path
we are sharing you will you will never hear me say
we are
to go to the fifth dimension
we are
to leave the earth
to i don't know to enlighten ourselves no i will always say
we are
to be responsible for those things
we have created
that we ourselves had distorted
that we ourselves must to balance
harmonize again
is the base of
we have to do with our awareness
is
through the history all the spiritual people
were trying to separate the reality of heaven
the earth um they were trying to leave the planet without realizing
these are not two forces
this is just one force
that as much you want to leave the world it's more difficult to live it
there's nowhere no place to go
for example we may can say
we can go to another dimension no we cannot go to other dimension it's impossible to go to another dimension
dimensions are just perspectives of the truth
you can become in another dimension not to go you can become
in order to go into
dimension to go to become
other dimension
i have to do is to reach harmony in balance with
perspective
for
we must be responsible imagine
what i was saying is
we usually believe
we have to leave earth
we think it's separated
we have to go to heaven leaving earth
what we have to do is to put both together
one of the main things
we have to understand
they both need each other is
the spirits are willing to be born
this is
they are looking for us to reproduce a biological way the spiritual mind used biology to be born to change our perspective about
is not
the spirit is coming down from another level or from another place the spirit is everywhere
the only thing
the spirit needs is to become the matter the spirit doesn't go down into the matter the spirit transforms itself into matter
in order to do
it needs energy
it needs to become um to become uh hormones
the hormones into spermatozoids
eggs
then the body we should not picture the idea of the spirit going down into the matter like you have a baby in informing for me
then the spirit comes
get inside no is the end the the spirit itself becoming matter
the process to get into matter is energy
we call the soul
this is not a separate process it's a continuous
this is the same not only for having kids babies reproduce it is also for myself to activate my own spirit
in order to connect to my spirit is not downloading the spirit is allowing the spirit to express through me
the point of connection between the spiritual mind
the physical aspect is the connection between the hypothesis gland inside the brain
the genital glands
this is
we can recognize the need of the spirit to be felt itself in the matter
the way
the spirit can feel
each one of the cells is activating the enlightenment of the spirit in matter we used to call
orgasm
i'm not speaking about the orgasm
maybe we can describe in in a way in an easy way like let's do a a quick a quick
and
then i go uh i i uh no touch
go you say in english yeah it's not the touch
go uh it's not the momentary sex it it is different
it's not about the genital energy is about the sensitive energy
this is not um like the feeling is only in the genitals it's also in each one of the cells of the body
if i if i don't need if i don't feel
energy uh in each one of the cells in even in my head is
i'm not really activating
potential of the spirit
in order to allow ourselves to feel the presence of the spirit inside our body
we need to do is to allow ourselves to feel
recognize
an orgasm is
is
it's
important to let free our sexual energy to allow ourselves to feel
energy to um let the blocks go away um
to allow ourselves to perceive
energy
otherwise we have nothing to compare to realize
energy
now i am not speaking about sex with another person i am always speaking about the own sexuality i'm not even speaking about tantra
tantra is like a doctrine
is helpful
you start to be a student in
to handle the whole energy not just the sexual energy you um learn about all the energy not just
i would leave the time trap for
the first process the the first things
we need to understand
we go to the handling of of spiritual energy in our body is to release all the stuck energy
we have in our body
the stuck energy we have is all traumas
we all have due to our society
of course uh everyone has one uh as our friend freud would say of course i i don't i don't like him much
he's he's um clear with these things all these different traumas
we have uh related to the genitals are the uh the main reason
we stuck these emotions
energy
we need for the meditations for the alignments for the planet for to work with the planet
this is
what we need to work with is with our own body
this implies to touch your own body to enjoy your own body
to feel
do you feel
do you have the shames
do you have the the the emotions the locked emotions
we have in ourselves some some i i'm reading i don't know i see just some words
some some people were saying to let's go to meditate
i think
we need to understand to understand these concepts
we are not going to meditate we are going to make an enlightenment
we need to understand some stuff
we do it
this is our the goal
we have i think is very important for us to understand
because is one of the most lot places
we have in our body
this movement of energy is very important
we will speak about all these things in many other videos of course
well
is uh important to understand the vibration of today is
s o
represents the path to life
this is
the statement of today is i am the path to life the code
information we have today is the node re
is
resonate the chords diacon's points continues like
asking to release the sound in the throat
lungs re is the d note in the alphabetic equivalence
it's a
it's aligned with the knee chakra
represents the history of every individual for
the node connects us with the tree of life
the family
crosses through all dimensions let's sit properly let's massage the body caress the body yawn
stretch if necessary
start to relax the body let the weight of your shoulders fall down i focus in my mind
my breathing my bring your attention
oxygen to your lungs heart blood organs
muscles take a moment to feel the heat in your body coming out through your skin filling up the aura
all the magnetical feel i feel around me the light of the mind
the light of the soul the emotional i feel the emotional light fresh as the one of the moon
the mental
spiritual light warm as the sun i recognize my body as the temple
leaves my spirit
my soul
i feel the light of the mind
the light of the motion caressing the walls of my temple oh with my hands i go to recognize the part of the body
the temple
the soul
the spirit anchors i take my hands to my hip
i start to massage by the sides of my head they go behind to the gluteus to the bottom
from the back i crease the spine
massage the spine trying to reach the coxes i go back putting pressure in the hip softly i massage below my belly puppies
in the sides to my legs softly i go down to the perine
from
i go up recognizing the parts of my genitals i recognize
here i can find the vital energy of my body i carries from the genitals to the heap
i relax my arms take a deep breath without any judgment i will picture in front of me the images of the traumas conflicts
repressions
i have related to these organs whether it is
i cannot use them or i use them a lot both of these realities come from the same origin the same conflict i observed
conflict in front of me no judgment i bring my attention to all the light
surrounds me
i invite
light to come inside my temple take a deep breath
allow the energy
light of the emotional on demand to go inside through the cupola in the crown the roses the windows of my eyes to the candles from
to the bell in the tower of the throat the sacristy
the heart the altar
the plexus the whole enquire in the sacrament reaching the door of my temple i recognize
this portal of my temple is the door through
comes the light
goes out the light i recognize
i open the doors
from my genitals gets in the light
i can see in the physical world
from my crown he had seen the light of the spiritual world
even though both of them are the same light
i have around me
is the sacred tour of my temple maybe
door is locked maybe
door is broken maybe
door was forced
i must realize
it's only me the one able to open them from within to let my own light come out take a deep breath
i allow myself to activate the potential of the i am in my genitals
i recognize i can open my doors i can't transcend the trauma i can't become life i can feel i can set me free i start to vibrate
activate the light my genitals
song songs take a deep breath i push
open my doors letting all the light come outside shining over my trauma my conflict my repression watching it to dissolve to become light disappear i observe these traumas to become neutrons for
light they become water
minerals for my roots i feel the light go out through my genitals through the doors bringing all my inner light shining outside bringing light to each dark corner around me bringing life vitality to myself i recognized
i used the same energy
was pushing me inside to open the doors to push
express in the outside
i recognize
i am the path of life i am the path to life i am the path of life i am the path of life i put my fingers on my genitals
i in light all the inner brightness i am the path of life i am free i can't transform myself into vitality i can use my sexual energy to create i am the path of life i take my hands to my heart to calibrate i start to bring
consciousness from my heart towards all my body creating stretching yawning
i come back
and
open my eyes all good
now
we have our door open i give you the task
task is as all the others um not for
moment
for your whole life
it could be fun in some way
the the task is to find your g-spot the one is not necessary to be in your genitals it can be in any part of your body
that spot is the one
all the energy is focused
concentrated
is a place
when you touch it
you massage it you can feel the tension the pain
then the release is like an energy
it can goes in every part
every cell of your body
uh it's not necessary to be as i said it's not necessary to be in um in the genitals it can be in any part of your body
is the place
the energy is stopped some people were asking
how do i look for it that's it you have to look for it
those things for sure is touching character
is touching erasing looking for places
maybe you have never touched in your own body
this is a task for today
thank you for being
and for trust
to
we see we keep going keep moving see you tomorrow for nice rest
