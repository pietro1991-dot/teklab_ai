Hi everybody , good morning and afternoon , good evening. Hello. So we went to Position today , the temple in the city of Abdul in the south. And what we did in this temple was something that we were not supposed to do , because our main idea was just to do a tiny meditation that was proposed by Wiki and Judith.

And it was to weave the NA so we can share the pattern of , we could share one of the crystals that we are , that I am going to deliver in the south pole , which is the closure of the entire thing , the entire trip. So that 's the last crystal on being delivered. And so we took that crystal and the idea that the activity would be to weave that , and create a net of NA between all the people inside the temple , 36 people in one side , 36 in the other. And the goal was to share it from hard to hard looking to the eyes and sharing this with all the love , within the NA of our new humanity , like the concept of , of delivering this love and conditional love in order to create something new.

And we 're something just for the beginning as a key to open the temple as always , of course , what we are supposed to , what we were supposed to do in each temple to open the information and to download the information to the crystals. So it was just an opening , but suddenly it turns out to be the two hours of that. And it was so powerful and amazing how everyone reincarnated the concept of sharing this infinite love with each part of the NA. It was so , so intense , so powerful that it took the entire time that we were there in the temple.

And it was like , so , and the difference that that we had here is that instead of being us in the center , the 12th of us in the center with the crystals and the people around holding us all , the difference in this , in this time was that , that the people were in the center , creating the NA by weaving this , this crystal sharing it with love , charging it with all the and conditional love. And we were outside and eventually we started to kind of like incarnate the idea of the shape of the archingials. We started to become like like their archingials with wings and I do n't usually work with the archingials. I 'm not related to the concept of the archingials.

I never been working with that , but today it was so powerful and so present. The essence of the archingials like the 12th surrounding the entire humanity as they were sharing this love. So it was completely different from what we expected , but was so powerful that it had to last all that all that time. So this , the incredible thing is that this , this 72 group of people that we were 36 and 36.

As they were sharing this , this , in conditional love to one another from the heart and they took all the time to do that. We were holding them from the outside feeling this marching celtic energy. Like if they are changes were surrounding this group of humanity. Like if we were like the earth and the other dimensions were holding the new NA , the new idea of this new information awakened inside.

And the great thing was the signals that we lived there because when we started to organize inside to begin the task there were two bats like this , and the bats started to fly around and then they left and when they left this tiny bird got in. And it was flying from north to south to north all the time going through the line of the NA along the temple and it would stare at us from one side and then go straight through the line where the people were connecting. So the bird was two hours doing exactly the same as what we were doing and it was amazing. It was incredible how we felt connected with what was happening with the bird and the marching well 's and the singing.

The singing was like many angels singing. It was so so powerful when it was expressed and as the people were the 172 were sharing this love to one another which took like almost the two hours. As they were sharing this love then they gave it to one of the notes and the notes that are the 12 us. We started to wave them over the or upon the the people so it was like if we were the planet we 've in this information holding the humanity and the information of humanity.

And so then the energy of the creator came and he started to connect the the people into like kind of a network connecting like hand with hand and hand with hand and they started to create the entire shape of the NA. And I felt like I was approaching doing the process of connecting the the chemical of the NA and when we were when it finished he did an activation and then started to open and divide the NA again like another protein and like like creating two new cells. So. And after it did that when it was like kind of the division of the NA could continue to sell.

The the time was over and everything was perfect. So it was it was amazing it was it was incredible. So. Also remember that all Syrian is a ten it 's a not London temple even if the Egyptian used it.

For for them of course this temple was used for the people to. The women to know how to give birth in awareness so we kind of did this of the NA there because. It was like like a place of creation to manifest the NA for a new being to be born so this time we we were n't there to make a birth but. And then we were doing the proclamation for the NA for the new ones to come.

So I was I was just saying that. Here 's max I was just saying that if he felt anything and he felt exactly the same like the winds and and and I said. I 'm speaking here with my ex husband. So how to do this go.

Well I just wanted to share this with all of you so you have the idea of what we were living and also to give you the concept of tomorrow of what we are going to do tomorrow so you can be connected. Tomorrow in Saka we will be activating the product through the four. The four lines of time and the four lines of space. And we will be the 12 of us around the the cube.

And representing the notes of course. The race of light everything and around and also of course the elements. Earth fire water. And we will be connecting with our 72 attributes all together which are the people that are here.

For those who want to connect with us we will be there between five to seven p. m. Five to seven p. m. all together in Saka. So we will be connecting. From there through time and space the four elements and all the attributes together. Through the 12th notes of the world.

So if you want to connect with us I would recommend you to. These two hours to connect and listen the the the the songs that we did that are called the 12 names. The 12 names. So it 's called alma with two ms and the the second name of the.

Of this is alma the 12 names names. So our 12 songs that describes basically all the concepts that we are going to be activating tomorrow. This music is in Spotify in YouTube and iTunes everywhere so you can look for them. So also I posted today in the in Instagram.

The image of the crop cycle that appears today in England that describes exactly what we are going to do tomorrow. So look the image and maybe with the image you can connect by watching by mediating on the image you can connect with what we are going to do tomorrow. So we are all working each one in what we are supposed to do and. It 's working perfectly.

So of course that I am not in the. I 'm not in the. I 'm not able right now to make. I 'm not.

I 'm not in. I 'm not able right now to make. I 'm not able right now to make a line to guide the element. So as we are practicing this week I recommend you to do the element by yourself.

Remember listen the music in the blog you find it there. And also. By thinking about the topic for today. Imagine the reflection of serve the reflection and.

Do the connection from hard to hard to balance your to parts. Okay tomorrow is. Toro day is the last day of our first week of Gemini. So we will be connecting.
