Hi everyone. Good afternoon , good evening. Everyone fine. I 'm sorry.

I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry. I 'm sorry. So yesterday was a bit hard , heavy.

And I 'm not still really well. I 'm really tired for what happened yesterday. I 'm not going to be able to speak much today about anything. But I did n't want to to let this day pass and meet you every day.

Sorry for those who are new in this. Suddenly you got like the widest experience yesterday. Maybe you are used to listen to me explaining things. And suddenly I was channeling in this meeting.

And of course it was n't an online which is because it was not information for to share. So basically the meeting yesterday was a meeting regarding everything that we are doing , everything that we have to do still. And the different points of view of different beings that we are trying to share. There are ideas.

For some of them we are in this moment to make a great leap to our evolution. And for many others we are kind of kids still. So they say that we need like two more cycles. Which two more cycles for them is 26,000 years each.

So more than 50,000 years. So there were like around 20,000 beings that they were speaking to each other. And when some of them started to talk to me , I just broke into tears. Because I felt the responsibility and some guilty.

Basically it was like kind of a meeting about the task that we have to do. So basically what they were saying. Some of them also they did n't agree with us sharing some data. Like more specific data unless we really know how to handle it.

But some others said that in order to handle it we need to prove we need to try it and to make mistakes. So basically they were talking about that. Yep , but not regarding the whole humanity , but mainly about the network , the people that we are working all together right now. Doing this.

Basically the reason why I felt guilty and what I feel guilty. It 's because I took part of the commissions in serious regarding the topic for today , which is the star series in the in the in the In the constellation of cans major. I was part of the commissions that in the moment when they spoke about the virus spreading in the system. We started to see to put the seats in the different worlds.

And kind of I was one of the people that point to the earth for many others. And that 's why I felt many times really guilty because even if many of the souls that came to leave here like you. Where we 'll into it decided to do it. I always felt like kind of guilty for being the one that pointed.

Kind of that was and is one of the of the weights that I 've been carrying. So there is a why I felt like this on which is because. Some of these beings they say. What you are doing is not enough and it will take like two other cycles.

For them to be ready for us to be ready because now. And one of those who need two more cycles. And living here. Is like kind of heavy.

And of course that we have decided this and is our very will. But in such a way. Being human makes you feel like you need to protect the family to. To push the the herd.

And I do n't know somehow to defend. And with this that I 'm saying I do n't want for you to think that this things are like kind of deciding over us or. Or trying to I do n't know to judge what we are doing. Basically.

I would I would like for you to understand that they just have different cultures and they have different ways of. Voices and sometimes what we perceive like they are angry they are not angry. It 's just. The ways and their emotions.

Basically something else that they said. Is that. Is important for us. That in order to grow up.

We have to be very responsible of this reality and this is not. So we have to try to transcend this. This ideas of. Like the kindergarten teacher.

I 'm saying. Oh you 're doing it great. I put you one star because you did a beautiful drawing. You 're doing it great.

No they said they said you have to grow up. And to remember that this is not. This is not. So basically you.

You have to grow up. And this being. So here to remind us that. We need to grow up like that.

So this is related to what yesterday we were talking about. The more fused. Dream. More fused.

Means shape. Form. And more fuses. The one that shaped the dreams of the people in the mythology.

And. One day. He just decided to show the truth. In the dreams.

To the people. So people started to wake up. But they were so used. To the dream that they started to leave the reality as if it were a dream.

And that 's what we 're doing. Still today. Opening our our eyes. Awakening from the dream.

But even though. We still live. Our reality like if it is. A dream.

Magic. And when you become aware. And when you become aware. And when you become aware.

And when you become aware. Magic does n't exist. You are responsible of what is magic. And the dream.

Was created by. The magic is created by vibration. The vibration of. The music of or fused.

This vibration is the one that. Creates all our realities. But the thing is that sometimes. We are touched so much to the melody of that music.

And we are creating the network that we are creating that we do n't want to. To give it away. Like. We are touched to the.

Music that we have done. And that 's the moment when you lose what you have done. Because you 're not there into. To transform to change.

So the great. Test. That we have to go through is to. We all something that is beautiful.

And to face the truth that. It wo n't work. That maybe. It just disappear vanished.

Just to learn to death from expectations. And to see what you have to do. So each one of you. Should n't know what.

You have to do. I 'm not the one. Then must tell you what to do. So according to the topic for today.

Serious has been always in human history the one given order. To everything that we. Have come to do they gave order to our civilization to our way of understanding the universe. That 's why they give us some clues and ideas of how to follow what to follow.

But we have to know exactly our way of doing it. By the moment my way is to share. One of the things that. Happened yesterday with.

The woman the feminine aspect that was singing. Some some of you ask why is the name of the song but. It 's it was not the song it was someone. Someone.

Speaking. In a way of a song. And. And.

So she basically felt like the energy of the mother. And. She basically said that. For her we will always be the kids the children.

But that maybe. That 's what we had to. That 's what she also have to give away the image of being. The mother of children so we can grow up.

And what I have to say is just that. It 's one of you will figure out. What you have to do. What is your own way.

And I say this because. Not because I say I do n't care you just do whatever. I say this because. If we are expecting.

For the others to do what we expect for them to do. Like. Like you expect for me to do something. I expect for you to do something.

So we are not going to be able to. To do what we have come to do. For ourselves. That 's why we are doing this path of the.

I am is not to do something all together. Is to. Remember what we have come to do by ourselves. And that 's the way to reconnect the network.

By connecting with the I am. So I invite you to make the questions to yourself. Not to me or to others. May the questions to yourself.

And in order to refer to yourself to put order. The question should not be. Like. What are you saying.

Is much more to ask yourself. What am I listening. What I 'm hearing. Is not about to say.

I do n't understand what you say. Or. Yes. Is about.

What am I understanding. Because the way. You listen to things and you perceive the things. Is the way in which you are.

Receive information. And this is what they used to say yesterday in the in the in the top. And they had that usually what we do n't like to hear. We can see that judgment.

That 's why we are not ready. We are still making questions to the outside and not to the inside. Yesterday the being that. Whole us all together.

Name name himself itself. Like. Ah , have up he. And I have no idea about Jewish tradition or.

The. Diva. Witnesses. So I just did.

What anyone in Aquarium time would do. I look for it in Google. So yeah , I have up here. Basically said.

Ted for a Grammaton. Which means. Four great letters. So the name basically.

Is a summary of four important letters that are the summary of four words. That basically means. The. Diva.

A year. A share. Yeah , but I do n't know. Some of the words I 'm missing.

The one that creates everything that is created. Which is translated like. I am. So basically nothing.

Nothing. So basically nothing. But. Missing decided to.

Use this for letters. Remember that what we are doing this path is to get. All things united. This is why usually we can.

Related to many different things. But they are all speaking about the same. So. The.

All the things that we are talking about. And we are related to the star of series. Series is basically the. The star that represent order for us that put all the things together.

That organized the being. And when you find the order. You find also freedom. And then you find the freedom is.

The freedom is basically. Riches by the order. If I ration for today is. The statement for today is I am the word of order.

The code for today is earth. In the aspect of mineral. The second aspect of the terrestrial. Trinity is mineral.

Which unified the different aspects of expressions. Generating by the magnetism. Pressure of gravity. That forces them to combine creating different.

Perspectives for that. They are the. They direct product of the soul of the earth. They are the result of their energies combined.

To generate colors potentials new energies and foundations of realities. I know that there are many things to talk about this. But I am not in the mood to speak them. Because I am not.

In this. Right potential to. To share to explain. I will.

I will call to. The concept that we spoke yesterday. Then we can find our own. Way to order.

I still need to process. Yesterday. The alignment was done in the middle of the. Conversation.

We set the intention we did everything in a different way. Of course , but their standings and their. The words were the ones trying to. Align us.

Today. Remember that series is a star of our. Solar lewis. Which is our own self.

And. So that 's why we have to. Do it today. On our own.

To ask ourselves the questions. And we have to ask ourselves. So we have to ask ourselves. If our own personality.

If our own self. Within. And so refer to ourselves to. Look for the order.

So I am not going to. Guide the alignment today because I 'm not. I 'm not able to do it. So I 'm not going to guide but I will put the music.

And. And. It 's one of us. We do.

The. The process. So. Let 's go to.

Make ourselves responsible. I 'm. The. The.
