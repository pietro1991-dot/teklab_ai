hi everyone 
good morning good afternoon good evening 
well in this beautiful place we have 
today 
two weddings and 
the guy in charge of music 
um it a little bit 
higher than normal so 
it doesn't matter where i am in this 
place um 
i can hear it everywhere 
so um 
so i hope it doesn't bother 
to you while i speak 
so sorry i i just forgot what was the 
topic for today and i was just saying 
in spanish that i had no idea what was 
the topic so um 
i'm really sorry for the new ones that 
is the first time that 
that you are listening to me and maybe 
you say this guy is not serious at all 
but um actually i have the license of 
saying these kind of things because it's 
been a year 
and most of all i 
well we are like family right now so 
so i can say these kind of things like i 
have no idea what was the topic for 
today 
and i'm really lost so 
um 
so but yes innovation 
people let me 
remember what it was 
so also of course that um 
that every day i have therefore to 
to to know what i wrote 
uh in the post because usually i have uh 
to write the poses like a kind of a 
meditation so when i finish the writing 
i don't i didn't check it again so kind 
of i forget what i wrote 
um so 
so sometimes i have no idea 
about anything actually it's been like 
many hours so 
um let's see 
one of the things that i mentioned today 
in the conversation was about 
resting 
when are we going to rest after all this 
task and all the things that we are 
doing when 
when is the time that everything will 
finish and we 
we achieved what we have come to do 
and um the answer of my 
um 
was 
never what are you talking about like 
the 
it was unexpected but it was like 
what 
what are you talking about 
why do you want to rest 
for what of what 
what for 
sorry so um 
so this is one of the things that we 
have to understand in order to go into 
innovation 
so let's begin with that 
so 
many times a lot of people asked me and 
this is why i asked that today 
too 
um 
about 
they said matthias when this is gonna 
end 
when 
when everything will finish and 
our process and all what we are doing 
will end and so we can 
rest after everything that we have done 
and uh i usually say that this is not an 
easy process that is sorry that is not 
an easy way to say uh eventually i don't 
know in five years or something like 
that 
that is a long process to do 
and uh but today my higher self gave me 
many more reasons to to understand 
what it meant 
um 
this process 
so 
sometimes 
uh when we look into our world with with 
the eyes of present 
when we see everything from 
our current days 
we look into people we look into 
ourselves we look into trees houses and 
everything that's that is around us and 
we kind of have the appearance that 
everything is constant there like if 
it's static 
like it's not changing like i can say 
i am myself since the moment i was born 
and 
that's it so 
the things are like that like if there's 
a moment of stability in the things 
that they don't change and then comes a 
moment of change 
well actually it's not working like this 
as we have seen many videos ago 
that 
change is constant it's something that 
is not for some periods of time it's 
something that is happening every day 
it's just that we don't see it because 
we just have a short 
vision of what reality is 
but when we see the entire picture of 
what reality is 
we will see that every 
stage of our existence is just 
a part of a big process 
the human that we are 
is not the end 
of the project humanity 
is not oh this is a human this is me 
this is a human 
and 
this this was what nature was meant to 
do 
with ourselves 
no we are just another link 
into a long process 
of development 
into long process of evolution 
but here is important to understand that 
the process of evolution is not heading 
to anywhere 
it's not the it's not something that has 
a project that has a goal to achieve 
so we never end changing 
there's no 
goal 
in what we do is a constant of change 
evolution 
doesn't have a goal because sometimes we 
we can't misunderstand when we say 
through evolution we achieve to be human 
and sometimes in that sense we can we 
can interpret it 
as if something in nature decided for us 
to exist so evolution was doing 
something for us to be humans but no 
basically evolution is the art of nature 
to adapt to every environment 
to every context 
so it's not about 
someone deciding 
what we have to be 
is about 
we adapting 
to the environment 
so eventually we as humans will have to 
change too 
to new environments 
this is why humanity is not a goal in 
evolution humanity is just another link 
in evolution 
eventually we will have to change 
so this is why when we 
when we say 
when is coming the moment of resting 
after this process 
we should rethink the sentence because 
there is no moment 
of ending in this process is something 
constant 
so it's not about something ending in 
order for me to rest for all the things 
that i've done 
but i have to discover that the process 
of resting 
is just the moments of earning 
and gaining 
energy 
during that process 
so let's 
visualize it 
let's draw here 
evolution 
evolution 
so what is evolution is basically a path 
in which the energy the particles are 
following a resonance 
throughout 
the wavelengths 
let's take this line if it is 
as if it is the neutral 
point 
so let's have these two these two words 
in one side of the line we will have 
action 
and action will be like 
equal to contraction 
and in the other side we will have 
reaction 
that we will call it distension 
distress 
so these parts from the top the heels of 
the wave will be equal action because 
are the moments when we 
we create the action the energy 
so 
we can relate it to contraction in 
muscles in the matter and everything 
because 
it's like the contraction of the muscle 
of a structure so much that you generate 
a lot of energy and then boom it's 
released with a lot of tension okay so 
that's the contraction 
so we can 
as an example we can understand this 
here like with your fist you close your 
fist create like this 
and 
by doing strength you will feel all the 
heat and the energy created and then you 
release it and you will feel all the 
the power that is released 
the moment of reaction is basically 
the result of the action 
that will be 
completed by the values of the wave 
so 
once we have the action 
the reaction will be open in your hand 
and when you open your hand right now 
you will feel 
this tension like 
like the energy is released and you 
have no energy in your hand it's like 
soft 
so this distinction is the is the one 
that that allows the body to restore 
the energy in the hand so you can close 
it again 
so these two 
sides is what us in our common life 
we call um 
we call to be in alert or to be relaxed 
to be awakened or to be asleep 
sleeping 
so this is what we could call 
state of alert which is to be 
awaken 
or the state of relax which is to be 
slipped 
so as we see here this is a 
evolution and sometimes we have some 
crisis when we got some crisis for 
example here um 
it can create like a distortion in the 
entire way um 
in the entire wave 
um 
of a vibration 
that can create distortion in our state 
of alert and relaxation so sometimes we 
can be asleep a long a long time or 
sometimes we can be 
sleepy 
much more than usual so throughout 
millions of years of evolution this 
process of awakening and sleep and so on 
was 
controlled by the nerve system calling 
being called like the sympathetic and 
the parasympathetic system 
that we already spoke 
in another month 
so 
we have these two ways in which the 
nerve system is in charge of this state 
of alert and relaxation 
so these cycles are related to of course 
the light 
the movement of 
a planet so in our world the earth 
this system will be related according to 
how many hours of light how many hours 
of of night we will have 
and according to if we see the sun or if 
we see the moon 
so along this process 
our 
our mind 
has designed 
a way to 
understand 
our way of life 
like when do we have to sleep and when 
do we have 
to be awakened 
so now 
when we are awakened 
is the moment in which we have the time 
to find food to find a place to sleep 
to feel secure so basically during the 
those hours that we are that we are 
awaken 
are the time 
we need we have in order to put our 
energy in to look for 
our main needs 
because then we sleep 
we know that 
we also have to because when we sleep we 
earn energy 
so 
we must sleep so we can have the energy 
enough for the next day to look for the 
basic needs 
until that until this moment is very 
logic it's all logics 
so eventually when we start to get 
aware and intelligent 
as as a being as in 
as a human 
we start to 
find the rhythms 
in all this night and 
day 
so the hours in which we have to sleep 
the hours that we have to 
um to work to find food 
so eventually to understand how the 
starts moves in the horizon what are the 
the 
the best dates for 
for the moon for the sun create a 
calendar and suddenly we celebrate those 
days and suddenly we create a culture to 
live to for our life we create a culture 
to understand this process of finding 
the needs 
eventually this culture 
started to be 
like a way of understanding 
that 
everyone needed to do something in order 
to 
have food 
everyone needed to 
work 
so 
they started to create these cultures 
that they said 
we 
need to work during the day 
as much as we can 
because if we sleep 
we will die we don't have the food for 
the other day so 
speaking about the 
the past 
they start to think that 
to sleep it was a lose of time 
it was something that was not useful for 
for everyone 
so after a while of doing this 
hard work 
every day 
suddenly some people start to ask 
why am i 
to do this 
is my life only for work 
is my life only to suffer 
and just to have 
a little time to sleep 
so 
is this kind of a 
of a 
punishment from someone that we have to 
suffer every day and we cannot enjoy 
life 
will come eventually a moment of to rest 
in which we don't have to work to 
achieve our things 
so this was very this question was very 
useful for agents 
that 
kind of got the idea 
that we have come to this world to 
suffer 
and we have come to the world to 
do a hard work to prove to someone 
that we worth it 
and 
that we should not be punished 
and to 
and if we do the right job 
we can go back to 
heaven 
to the paradise 
to live happily ever after 
and to rest 
not having anything to do 
so basically this vision 
of 
of suffering 
and to do the hard work 
to reach the 
divine um 
in the paradise 
is a semitic point of view 
the semitic cultures 
that they of um 
monotheism 
uh which is they believe in only one god 
were the people from the middle east 
that they created this uh this vision 
that we were here as a punishment 
and uh 
this was not the problem for the people 
that were politicistic that they 
believed that the gods were part of the 
nature so 
being alive was kind of a 
joy a gift 
so they were celebrating everything 
for the politician 
it was not the punishment to be alive it 
was a gift 
this idea 
the hard work and the suffering to get 
the things 
from the semitic 
religions 
was brought to the roman empire 
and then spread in all europe with the 
culture of work 
that then was brought 
to 
the entire planet with the colonization 
and 
of course now globalization 
the concept of 
we have to work 
really 
hard to deserve 
a moment of rest 
um 
so 
there was a um 
a very 
christian idea that 
if we do a hard work a very hard work 
during our life 
the gift 
the price of this 
will be heaven will be the paradise 
after death so you have to wait until 
you die in order to rest properly 
until that moment you have to do 
everything right 
to make the job 
so that's why it's something that it got 
stuck in us that we 
believe that if we do our homework now 
we will have the time to rest in a 
beautiful place after we die 
and i'm so sorry but it's that's not how 
it is 
this was one of the greatest ways 
of 
slavery 
of promote slavery 
in 
most of the human beings 
so 
basically it's a it's a slavery that 
nobody 
had to put it on us that we decided to 
follow which is i have to do my best and 
my hard work so when i die i can rest 
and 
do my 
um 
and to be free 
so even though we start to look for new 
tools to understand this and we 
transcend the idea of religion 
in advance we still have this concept 
that 
we 
have to find a moment of rest that 
eventually 
all these crisis and all this process 
and everything that we are doing for the 
awakening it should end and suddenly 
eventually we will find this moment of 
rest and everything be fine 
and uh 
we got that concept from religions 
we got that concept from 
a very 
old 
idea 
that after a work 
comes the rest 
so basically 
what we have to get from this is a 
different point of view 
which is not that we have to wait for 
a process to 
finish to end in order to rest because 
this is eternal 
it's a constant process 
so 
the process of testing is not the final 
process 
the process of resting 
is something inside the process 
which gives me energy in order to take a 
new action 
so 
the process of resting is something that 
we decide how we are going to live it 
according to how we act in our life 
according to 
which energy we put in our process 
which intentions 
the energy that we 
create in our actions 
is the one that will define 
our relaxation or life 
when we have the idea that 
the process 
is something that begins ends and then 
rest 
we are making a mistake 
because the process is eternal 
it's constant it's always 
so 
i can be 
all the time relaxed 
if i act 
in balance if i act 
coherence 
but 
if i act 
willing to finish something in order to 
rest i will be constantly in stress 
never finding the moment of rest 
so i propose to you something 
for this new age of aquarius 
we have to stay thinking about paradise 
or the eternal rest 
the word that will 
be used 
instead of paradise 
will be innovation 
innovation is the only word the only key 
that can help us understand 
that 
is an internal process 
that is something constant 
innovation is not only related to 
technology 
innovation is basically to leave the 
action of living in this in the new 
things 
innovation the action of living in the 
new things 
when we 
think about a process as something that 
we have to finish 
we will never see the end 
we will be always stuck in the same 
process once and again 
repeating and that's what makes us feel 
so 
terrible 
karma 
but 
when we 
instead of 
aiming to finish something 
we aim to start something new all the 
time 
we will be constantly living in the 
paradise 
and we have to have something very clear 
about 
how to innovate 
that if we want to innovate 
if we want to transcend into something 
new 
we should be flexible 
into 
the new 
things 
so we have to 
allow ourselves to change to transform 
ourselves 
and transform ourselves 
means to change our points of view 
which means that 
when we become conscious 
consciousness is not a synonym 
of morality 
so remember this 
morality 
morality 
is related 
to the quality 
of 
a specific place in a specific time 
specific place and specific time that's 
morality 
so when we see the future we cannot 
judge the future with morality 
we should be conscious 
which is wide open 
let's not mistake morality with 
consciousness 
in order to live the future 
in order to leave 
this new reality 
here and now what we have to do is to 
innovate 
innovate all the time to learn something 
new constantly and so we can leave the 
paradise here and now
