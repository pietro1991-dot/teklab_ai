hi everyone good morning good evening good night
does
find you you were able to do the list ah today i was uh in the morning doing my my homework of uh write it down the least inside the pyramid um it's a very bizarre uh bizarre um situation the people coming inside was like watching me like i'm in an office writing
working
it was inside the pyramid
um it was fun um i i've been i've been reading some of the comments today
i've seen
some of you may have some conflicts with doing
list
um i would like to clarify some of them
the whole month will be like
a teacher giving homework uh every day not even the
won't be
won't be weekend no holidays for for
month
the first issue is i hate doing
so one of the of the reasons
we maybe have a conflict with doing
is
for sure maybe
we were childs we had like
kind of a big tiny trauma uh at school
they were pushing us to write down to correct our mistakes by uh by repeating the words
um
uh all
this kind of task
they were pushing us to make
list to write down uh maybe those things can create us a conflict
we have to write down to
we have to do
kind of things
uh
can we transcend
um
the reason
we have a trauma is
usually
was something
we hadn't do for ourselves all the pressure of
or all the the the hate
we have on doing
specific task is
usually in our lives we were pushed to do it by for others not for for myself
um
task is for yourself
this is something
you have to do for your self it's not a homework i am asking for you to do if you don't want you don't do it
simple it's not something
will i don't know
will be bad for the exam
there's no exam it's just for yourself
it's something
helps you to vocalize to put your attention
to make it physical
otherwise
you just think in one your your mind just go away
starts to fly around
when you write it down it is
and
you can go
check it again
watch it the reason
we maybe have
much problems doing
concrete task is
for sure
we were kid someone was constantly saying put order in your room um order your your your book order
and
and
would be like kind of a trauma for some people of course
for the people
is more balanced no balance for the people
is more mental
um
analytic for sure it would be like very easy
it was like it's something
calms the mind to write down
it's totally the opposite for the people
just flies around myself for example i i used to do a list every day of
i was supposed to do
i was supposed to do
day even if i wouldn't do
i would write down a list for every day just to just to have it to to feel comfortable
uh for the analytic people uh would be um would be very difficult to imagine for example maybe
when we reach the month in
we will have to work with imagination
would be something hard for those people
this is one of the main things
we need to acknowledge
we realize
we want to put order in our lives if we want to put order we need to write it down to organize it to put each one of the of the issues in its own place
this is for ourselves for our own order
it's just a tool to do
imagine
what happens is
um i was i was looking in the in the comments
was
difficult
we usually say about um yeah we have beliefs
i have a lot of beliefs in my life
this is my belief blah blah blah
when you are supposed to write down your beliefs suddenly it's like if your brain is saying wait a moment
what is my belief
do i believe
it's very difficult to acknowledge
are my beliefs
what is worst is
ones are positive
which ones are negative if you cannot figure out
one is positive
which one is negative at first just make a neutral list of your beliefs
then by thinking about them you just difference each one uh by trying to understand
one is positive
which one is negative
the reason
is
difficult to write it down is
the beliefs is like the essence of who we are
our body is trying to protect who we are it's like the blood the body is trying to hold the blood inside
you need it for to be alive
imagine
the blood of your mind is the beliefs
this is
it's
difficult to understand
is the belief
one is my belief
to write down the belief the mind is trying to protect itself
of course we are not even speaking about
we
we have to transform i believe
remember
i believe
is positive is the one
pushes to do something to
helps us to express ourselves to expand
the negative belief it is the one
pushes back
limit ourselves for example a positive belief is something
maybe we share
which is to believe
we have been sent by someone in the universe to change
to help the planet earth
we have a purpose that's a belief
then
could make
could happen or not is different
that's a belief
that's a positive belief
it helps us to move forward
do stuff for the world for example the universe is just expressing vibrations
atoms
molecules
makes it
makes me believe
makes me be
alive
uh for example not even me i know if
that i know from the universe is real
it was just translated into my beliefs for
is positive i believe is something
helps us to make meaning to put a meaning into things
to order things to put an order in things
that anyone has its own belief
this is just one of them
there's the other belief from
same uh from
same thing
maybe you can say nothing has any sense i am just a formation of molecules
i don't worth it i don't have nothing to give i don't worth anything
i
it doesn't matter
i do or i'm useless
imagine
this belief
you see it from the biological or physical aspect of the universe is not real
everything
exists in the universe is
it creates balance
everything in the universe is trying to organize
attach in such a way
creates harmony in the creation
if you are worth if you don't work
you wouldn't exist if you exist it's
you are
important
the universe needs you to exist
imagine
it's not just talking about god or a beautiful um um i don't know expression of the of the masters
beings in the universe
are given a sense
meaning no no it's just three atoms
join together
say if we don't create
person we all die look
this position creates a positive a positive belief
helps us to do stuff for the world
the negative belief
is something
pushed me down unnecessarily the most the most funny thing of all
is
none of them is true no one of the beliefs
we have is true no one
are those beliefs the ones
give meaning
understanding to the reason of
i exist
what we are doing
is not trying to understand
it doesn't have any meaning nothing
why do we do
we are doing
is
we we are not judging
now we are working in
we have in our beliefs without judging
we are working with virgo
virgo is not asking
is the sense the meaning of all
virgo is saying okay i have all
mess
how
do i organize all these parts
what is the meaning if i if i i am if i am um doing all
but doesn't matter
belief uh
belief i have uh is not real anything is real
what do i do
uh that's a philosophical concept philosophical concept
we will leave it for scorpio okay not
so virgo doesn't matter for birgo about the meaning of life for birgo is let's put order in life don't do existential questions right
what we are going to do
is to just focus in the tiny things the specifics
what i was trying to say about the beliefs are not going to tell you um the truth
their only perceptions of the truth is
we are not
to look for the truth
the only way you will reach to understand the truth is through the tools
you have
so we have to understand the tools in order to picture the truth the task the homework
i gave you
i will give you all
month is not just for these days it's for the whole life
we go from one belief to another
if we cannot acknowledge each one of the tiny things
forms us
made us through life we are not going to be able to find
truth in ourselves
to understand
to handle it that's br
brings us to our day uh today the crown chakra is all about beliefs
third eye chakra is about qualities remember
um third eye is a chakra
goes to sleep
that awakes okay
goes to sleep
awakes remember
that qualities also can be called abilities characteristics well all the things
i can have
i can express qualities abilities characteristics
we can have these attributes these qualities these abilities awaken or sleeping the qualities or capacities are not related to i know
to find
to paint very well qualities above all are related to the things
you
your personality have it's not about
you can materialize or do it's about
are you in your personality are those things
is not necessary for you to be doing it
people could understand it is something
you just simply are
people can notice by just watching you it's not about to think like in astrology
it is an astrology of course
but don't think about the things you learn from yourself in the outside i'm speaking about the qualities
you know
you have within
that you express even if you don't know about astrology or whatever
also we have to acknowledge
the qualities usually usually the qualities are things
others see in us
others says to us like you are
you are
there are things
usually other people tells to you
most of us are really ashamed to say or to acknowledge
qualities we have
we think
that would be very selfish to say
one of the reasons
we have to write down our qualities is
recognizing the qualities is not to be selfish is to realize
do i have as i have some beliefs i also have some qualities
we have qualities
are positive
qualities
are negative
of course qualities
are awakened
quality
i have
qualities
are slipped
i don't have the qualities
i have are the ones
i share with others
the qualities
i don't have are those
i admire in others
the positive qualities would be those
helps me
nourish me
also helps the others
nourish the others
the negative qualities would be those
helps me
doesn't help the others
let's write down all these qualities
we have
don't be ashamed don't think you're gonna be
be sincere with the positive
the negative
you may have for example i write the two main ones
i wrote for myself for example myself as a positive i believe i think i think
i am
i have a quality of a good communicator
a good educator i think
i feel
this is one of my qualities my positive qualities
i recognize
and maybe some of you or some people would say no you explain yourself as hell i don't understand anything okay anyway i believe i am a good teacher
for example as a negative i recognize in myself
i am i have a lack of empathy
um for me sometimes it's very difficult to feel the pain of other person i cannot understand it i don't understand
people may be suffering for example
um
when i look uh
i look someone
can hug someone
he's suffering
put all the energy in
person for me it's like wow i would like i would love to have
so those are like two examples
then of course you will reach yours
remember qualities are not things
you have learned in your life are things
you have with yourself from since
you are born okay it's like for me uh uh explaining
teaching i did
since i was a child nobody teach me
to make speeches or
to talk or
to teach that's something
isn't my soul okay that's
it's not qualities
i at queer acquire through life they are qualities
you have from the moment you were born each one must to work with
as its own time
when you feel yourself like i cannot do it i don't know
to write i cannot do it it's like okay take the double effort to write down maybe stay one hour go back again
try it okay i know
for some people like for example the cancer people they would be like like one month trying to complete the list
he will meditate he will cry a bit you know
the iris people would make the long list in just five minutes
asking what's next okay
each one at its own time okay
remember
the qualities are attributes of our personality
what we are doing
is trying to understand each part of our personality to understand who we are the vibration we are going to activate with
we are going to activate
third eye today is na na the statement of today is i am a conscience emissary
the information of today is the note sol or g solve it says forgive our faults apologists apologizes diacon in his poem for he knows

all the projections
perceptions
the outside world has from myself i also recognize
here it is
my consciousness awakens or sleeps is the center of my personality who i am who am i for myself
who am i for the world
it's like
with my vibration as i activate all my qualities of my personality take a moment to realize
each one of the qualities
creates my personality
are awakened or those who are asleep are the tools
help me realize who i am i recognize them i pronounce my qualities the first
comes to your mind i pronounce them to myself to recognize i simply say them i am i am i recognize them i am
and i activate them with my sound um no um as i pronounce my sound i allow the light of the third eye to expand bringing light clarity to makeup to my qualities recognizing
each one of them are those who make me who i am are those qualities
helps me to understand in
aspects i am aware i am conscious
this is
i activate it by recognizing
i am the emissary of consciousness i am the emissary of consciousness i am the emissary of the consciousness i am the emissary of consciousness
take a deep breath as i take my hands to my heart i recognize
i am capable to analyze my qualities
by understanding them i become aware conscious
i am the emissary of consciousness
softly i take
awareness from my heart to all my body causing stretching yawning i come back
and
opening my eyes
like
we anchor the qualities of the third eye the i am in the third eye
remember as i said
that the beliefs are those
push us to do things in our life
the qualities are the tools
we have to achieve those stuff
this is
after all
we can say
someone tells us
you are saying is not true you can say yes i know
