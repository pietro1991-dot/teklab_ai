hi everyone good morning good evening good night i hope you can hear me well
good thing if you can hear me it doesn't matter if you don't see me well the part of
is to hear to listen
it's fine
today we have to work with the knees
uh the knees are um those
are connected to our history to the path
everything
we have done all over history everything
we um
we haven't as information from the past is anchored in um is anchored in the knees
today
we have to work with is about the steps
we give in order to move forward
the steps
we give coming back walking backwards
i i'm reading some people
says it doesn't they can't hear it
everything is fine
so you you will be able to hear it later anyway
there's a lot of people
hear me well
it's not my problem to understand from
the energy of the knees are um are coming from we have to picture
we have spoken yesterday about the root chakra um
about our weeks
about our strengths
uh a picture uh about
we had spoken yesterday
we are like in an ocean of information
the top of these waves of the ocean are strength
we have
then the points going down are the weakness okay
both of them are called our attributes
these attributes are potentials
we have
um potentials
we have
are being created through the movement of the ocean okay
it creates energy constantly such as um uh as the uh strength
the weakness both of them are creating the attributes
the potentials
that made us be who we are
and
this would be like the energy
helps us to um to manifest everything
we have around
we can create if you want more details about
just go to the video of yesterday
taking the video of yesterday let's remember
if we take
ocean
layer of the ocean will work like a um like a launch length wave okay
let's remember
in
layer of the ocean we will have a part coming from
that is a low vibration or low frequency
a normal one
then a higher one
let's remember
in
ocean the ocean itself the water would be the the in
example of the ocean the water would be the space
it's all separations
vibration would be the space the special special aspect
the frequency would be the time aspect
is measuring the amount of time
it goes from one wave to another
let's remember
the vibration is space
frequency is time a low vibration would be a vibration
takes a long time to make a process of something
this is
to
low vibration
frequency we usually call it as the past
the medium vibration we call it present
the higher vibration like
we call it future
let's be aware of
that past present
future time is not something real just a perception of the vibration okay let's picture
that
we have a low vibration or
something
we are living takes a long time to be processed
means
the energy is in the past
something is balanced
harmonic we can say
we can see it
it's happening in the present
when something is vibrating very fast
means
it is in the future to all
process we call
history we have usually the idea
when something vibrates very low is something bad
bad um that's just a concept
we have of
is good
what is bad
being in a low vibration is not bad it's just being in low vibration we als we also believe
to vibrate high vibration is to be good or to be fine
no it's just to vibrate higher
it's not good for normally the animals they vibrate low they had a low vibration besides maybe the whales
normally they vibrate very low
are the animals bad
they're very very low
picture
in a high vibration we have the karmic console thank you the karmic console
the karmic console you have dark ones
light ones all of them
they are vibrating high appear to
we have a very misunderstanding of
it means to vibrate high
what it is to buy very low to vibrate low means
i have a very long a very long time to process something
when i vibrate it means
can catch a lot of vibration
information in just one moment
picture
animals usually they live to survive
mostly
they do is to eat sleep look for for food
so on reproduce
it's a just one process constantly in a long period of time
is the life
picture
the beans like in like the dark ones
the light ones both of them
are able to spread in the network of consciousness
to catch a lot of information from many points in the same moment they are vibrating high
they can't catch many data
take a deep breath
just leave the judgments in the side
let's go step by step location is a long period of time to process something high vibration means short period of time to process something see i am in the medium
in the medium i have a medium time process to process information
let's go more clear
because someone said
about a blood butterfly or or a fly
they live shorter time is not about
long
long it takes a life
it means the frequency of time is
is
you are taking a low moment to just do one thing it doesn't matter if it is just one day or if it is like years of your life if in
day or in or in um uh 80 years you were just focused on eating the process is
low
so slow
it means
just doing one thing that's one of the waves
imagine
that a being
is leaving only one wave it doesn't matter if it one day or 80 years it is just one wave in the universe
is low
it's just one process
in the middle we have many waves
we have many processes many things
we are living okay we live for food for relationships for projects
the beans
lives in
vibration constantly they can see everything they can see the whole they can see the future the past every possibility
they live too fast
now let's go to the false idea
we have the false idea
we have
the low vibration is bad
the high vibration is good basically the words to explain
we think
one is bad
the other one is is by two words resonance
dissonance i can be in a low vibration okay
in
low vibration i can be resonant with environment or dissonant with environment
picture
that i am a very low energy vibration person
i am living stuck in the past
for example i can be in a low vibration like
live an anchor in the history
in order to be resonant
i have to do is to pick up
history
way
i have to make all
process
maybe become an archaeologist a historian someone
can um someone
can um i don't know um
can write us a story
by
help many others by um by helping others to understand the history
for example picture
you have a low vibration
you're stuck in the 40s for example you say oh the the good time of history was the 40s
i want everyone in the 40s
i would do everything to push all the others to live in the 40s
by
i am just pushing everyone to live like
so i become like a dictator
we could live like in the 40s
what i did the same low vibration i made it resounding for the environment or
sun end or dissonant for the environment the same thing happens with the high vibration
for example i can high vibration
turn myself into master a guide
i see
everything is
fast
everything all the possible path
we have
i decided to guide people to find the most harmonious path through history or i can be a very high vibration being in the darkness
can be everything all the potentials of the future of every one of the being
i just by looking into them i say i will make them get confused in the history
they can create energy for myself
i can survive
do better stuff
this is
we have in the high vibration a guide
is resounding
um one
is dissonant
now in the middle reality we also have
we are all in the same vibration
we are resident or dissonant
in order to eat for it to find the balance in
process the stability we have to find harmony we have to harmonize the process
this is
we in the middle we are the consequence
the cause of all
history
according to
being in the middle we are the consequences of the low vibrations from the past
also the cause of the high vibrations in the future
here's
we become responsible
first of all i am the only one responsible to calibrate the vibration
comes to me from the past
it's me the cause
must be calibrated
the vibration
goes to the future
all these high vibrational beings are harmonious
resonance instead of dissonant
this is
we are the responsible to create the energy for those beings of the darkness or the light ones to use our energy or not
if i am unaware
conscious i would be giving my energy for the for the in the to the future to dark ones
if i am coherent
in balance conscious i am giving my energy for the future ones in the light that's terrible we cannot blame the low ones in the past
we cannot play the high ones in the future
both of them to get in harmony they need from from the for they need the present to do
so
is
what we call the beans of the high vibration they could be dark
light
the low vibration they also can be light
dark as we hear in our life we have people living in the dark
people in the in the light
let's picture
that there's no people good
bad there's only people resonant or dissonant
both of them
they need harmony
this is just to take us our side outside from
idea
we need people in other dimensions to help us or um or
we are um
just um i forgot
i said in spanish um basically
there are no good people by bad people
we are not fighting anything
we must be respond to go outside from the idea
there are good things
bad things to go outside the idea
we come from the past
we go to the future to recognize
we are the only one responsible everything to take outside take away
we judgement
we have put in the reality it's just a system
when i understand the system i just become responsible to order the system not to fight the system to put orderly on it
is
when we start to put order
is
we are doing
in virgo
we put order into a system we can realize we can know
to use it
to make stuff with it
let's try to understand
now
also
we have to recognize
when we usually say to live in the past we may think
it's bad
it's a low vibration
it's not bad living in the past the past is just the past that's it
are good things
bad things in the past
the same thing happened with the future is not
the future is a high vibration is all good the future could be hell it could be horrible too person 2 it could be a mess maybe we can blame uh we um maybe we don't like it
this is
we can understand
some of us maybe live in the past
the ideas of the past
the past we we love the
we live good things in the past
we would like to for it to be as always as it has been
it doesn't matter if it's a good thing
we lived in it's a low vibration anyway
for example
maybe you like
much your your childhood
you just think constantly
i can't be a child anymore i would like to be a child constantly
you live your life through
thing
you miss that's to live in the low vibration on the other hand i can also be constantly watching
i can do in the future the future i want to create stuff in the future
i cannot um be i cannot anchor or manifest anything in the present
we have good bad things or resonant
dissonant things in the past
in the present future
biologically we can picture
idea
every time
you make a step ahead you're losing ability
you don't know
you're going to put your foot forward
in
moment of insta
stability you will reach your strength
your your stability in the feet in the foot behind okay the foot behind
that foot is in the past
you find um the strength in the past in order to give a step ahead in the future
the only way we can um the only way we can uh do
is if we recognize the things
we have in the past
it's in the past from
we have the stability to build future consciousness would be the one recognizing the strength of
i can be
still
straight with
food giving a step to the future
from the unconsciousness
step would be fear
i don't know
i'm going to put my feet my foot is in
foot of the stability
i have the information from consciousness or unconsciousness
makes me make a step ahead into the future to go forward or to have to be afraid
to make a step backwards remember
the the energy from the past is the wave
pushes from
we are the consequence
then we are the cause of the pushing of pushing the wave for the fear
this strength
is coming from the past can come from the consciousness or the unconsciousness
this whether it's um or unconsciousness it could be good
bad it doesn't matter i will make an example with my own life
for example i have a very happy fact in my life in the past
was the death of my grandmother
affected me a lot
for me something negative
i would say calls me in the past picture
that
i worked with consciousness of
my grandmother has to die
i just recognized
she died
of something
she couldn't handle
by consciousness i realized
was
so i decided to transform
so her death was for me something
set me free to go ahead with without
heavy okay
something
um maybe come in the common life would be something
holds us back in the past was is was in the other hand something
took me ahead
for example in the other hand i always talk about
um beautiful love
i experienced in 2018
helped me a lot to feel love again um
i always remember
because it was really nice
really good
that's precisely
good thing
good feeling
is not allowing me to move forward
i'm just thinking about
what would have been
what would could be
that fact
are two things
all of you could live in your lives
this is
we can picture
sometimes the good things
happened in the past
is not allowing me to go ahead
bad things
happen are precisely the ones
push us forward
for example the list
we have to do today is
are the things
happen in my own history
allowed me to go ahead to move forward
what are the other things
happen in my history
aren't allowing me to keep moving see
when i do the list it doesn't matter if you have good or bad things in either column you will just recognize the source of the energy
comes the past
is pushing me forward i guess that's it okay
let's go to read the information of today the vibration of today is new
the statement for today is i am necessary of the wise ones
the wise ones are those who had lived the history
the code we have today is spiritual pattern n the leap is delivering yourself to the inevitable experience to the possibility of giving everything
is in the nucleus to be in the surroundings the n sound the end sound reflects the consciousness the conscience talking with the soul providing its view to be felt it's the handshake between the subconscious
the unconscious
i say
today
this um
in virgo we are working with the information uh of analyzing the information
is
we are talking much
the alignments are shorter okay
we have to focus the attention i i hope
uh all of you are uh are realizing about
but i have done my my task
this is
maybe you don't feel
i am coughing much as i did
so it works
now
i set it for sure i will cough let's go to do the alignment
let's start to massage the body okay to caress the body remember
i say massage the body
stretch the body i am thanking it for being the anchor of the spirit in the matter
take a deep breath relax the body i become aware of my breathing take a deep breath
with your imagination start to bring the oxygen to your lungs your heart blood organs
muscles i allow myself to feel the heat within my body feeling
it goes through the skin filling up my magnetical field my aura take deep breath
imagine over your head the light of the i am
start to bring all the energy around your body a fire going up towards the i am filling up the center with all the energy making it brighter
brighter as the sun take a deep breath
start to imagine
this light of the i am goes through all your body entering through the crown chakra going through the third eye the throat the heart plexus sacrum root
from
it divides into big rays of light towards the knees i recognize my niece the energy of all my history i become aware
in my knees are anchored the facts
circumstances
made me move forward towards the future or
hold me back towards the past i recognize
both of them show me in
stage of my path i find myself i can find the wisdom
i achieve through all the experience in my history
is
i set myself to activate the potential of
center to activate the wisdom of all these wise
bring me their knowledge to move forward take a deep breath
start to pronounce the vibration
activate my knees um
um um take a deep breath recognizing the consciousness of the i am in your knees i recognize i am the emissary of the wise ones i am the emissary of the wise ones i am the emissary of the wise ones i take my hands to my heart take a deep breath
recognize
every fact of your past good or bad positive or negative has the strength to help you move forward
all the past is full with all those wise ones
brings you their knowledge to build your path to move forward towards the future take a deep breath i am the emissary of the wise ones
all my energies will bring the messengers to the new ones in the future i am the energy of the wise ones i am the emissary of the wise ones i am the emissary of the wise
so knifeless insert probably
i talk to i begin to take
consciousness from my heart to all the body carries him massaging stretching
slowly i come back
now opening my eyes
in
way we anchor the ion in the knees as always if you feel charged with energy or dc or something just try to walk outside
to lay down on the floor uh move your body okay
drink a lot of water
um rest of course as always
um i remembered
um if you have some uh emotion
you don't know
you are feeling it just let it go
we are moving with
a lot of things
let it um all go out don't judge just allows you to feel it uh
it was um some people were asking if i was channeling no i was not challenging is it was just information from two different life
i had
they were they're very important for me
they were separated
so with the work they kind of shake hands
said we are
so that's
happened
rest a lot
see you tomorrow at the same time bye
