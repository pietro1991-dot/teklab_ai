- 230VAC models: L + N (no PE connection to sensor)
- Fuse protection: 1A slow-blow per TK3+ unit

**Relay Wiring (Safety Chain):**
- Use NC contact in series with compressor contactor coil
- Wire gauge: 1.0-1.5 mm² (18-14 AWG) for 230VAC @ 2A
- NC contact: Closed during normal operation → Opens on alarm
- Typical wiring: NC contact interrupts compressor contactor supply

**Multi-Compressor Systems:**
- Wire all TK3+ relay NC contacts in **series** (safety chain)
- Any unit alarm → stops all compressors
- Separate relay outputs identify which unit alarmed (optional)

### 6.3 Commissioning

**Pre-Startup Checklist:**
1. Verify power supply voltage matches TK3+ rating (24VAC or 230VAC)
2. Check all electrical connections secure
3. Verify oil return line connected and isolation valve open
4. Confirm relay wiring correct (NC contact in series with contactor)
5. Verify adequate oil in separator

**Initial Startup:**
1. Power on TK3+ units
2. Observe LED indication (should show red initially if crankcase empty)
3. Start compressor system
4. TK3+ valve opens automatically (yellow LED)
5. Oil fills crankcase to setpoint
6. TK3+ valve closes (green LED)
7. Monitor for 30 minutes to verify stable operation

**LED Indication:**
- **Green**: Normal operation (oil level adequate, valve closed)
- **Yellow**: Filling mode (oil level low, valve open, oil flowing)
- **Red**: Alarm (oil level low despite valve open for 60-120 sec)

### 6.4 Service & Maintenance

**Routine Maintenance:**
- **Quarterly**: Visual inspection (check for leaks, verify LED indication)
- **Annually**: Functional test (verify valve operation, relay output)
- **No scheduled component replacement** (replace only if failed)

**Electronic Module Replacement (5-10 minutes, no depressurization):**
1. Disconnect power (lockout/tagout)
2. Remove mounting screws (typically 2-4 screws)
3. Lift electronic module straight up (disconnect internal connector)
4. Install new module (align connector, press down gently)
5. Secure with mounting screws
6. Reconnect power and verify operation

**Valve Coil Replacement (5-10 minutes, no depressurization):**
1. Disconnect power
2. Remove coil retaining clip or screws
3. Slide coil off valve stem
4. Install new coil (align with valve stem)
5. Secure retaining hardware
6. Reconnect power and verify operation

**Complete Sensor/Valve Body Replacement (requires depressurization):**
1. Isolate compressor and oil return line
2. Recover refrigerant from crankcase (if necessary)
3. Remove electronic module
4. Disconnect flange bolts
5. Remove sensor/valve assembly
6. Install new assembly with new gasket/O-ring
7. Reconnect oil return line
8. Reinstall electronic module
9. Evacuate and test for leaks
10. Return to service

### 6.5 Troubleshooting

**Alarm Activates Immediately After Startup:**
- **Cause**: Oil separator empty or pressure too low
- **Solution**: Verify separator oil level, check separator pressure adequate (> 5 bar above crankcase)

**Valve Won't Open (Red LED, no oil flow):**
- **Cause**: Coil failure, wiring issue, insufficient differential pressure
- **Solution**: Check power supply, verify coil voltage, measure MOPD (need > 5 bar minimum)

**Continuous Filling (Yellow LED stays on):**
- **Cause**: Oil return line restricted, valve stuck open
- **Solution**: Check for blockage, verify line sizing adequate, inspect valve seat

**False Alarms (Intermittent Red LED):**
- **Cause**: Foam in crankcase, low refrigerant charge, undersized oil separator
- **Solution**: Check refrigerant charge, verify separator size adequate, check for liquid slugging

**No LED Indication:**
- **Cause**: Power supply failure, electronic module failure
- **Solution**: Verify power supply voltage at terminals, check fuse, replace module if needed

## 7. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

### 7.1 Product Classification & Comparison

**Q1: What is TK3+ - sensor or regulator?**
TK3+ is an **oil level regulator** (not just a sensor). It combines electro-optic level detection with an integrated solenoid valve and control electronics for automatic oil level regulation.

**Q2: TK3+ vs TK1+ - What's the difference?**
- **TK3+** = Oil level **regulator** (sensor + valve + control integrated, automatic operation)
- **TK1+** = Level **switch** (detection only, requires separate valve and external controller)

Use TK3+ for automatic plug-and-play operation. Use TK1+ for BMS/PLC integration.

**Q3: TK3+ vs TK4 - What's the difference?**

**Configuration Method:**
- **TK3+**: DIP switches on device (manual parameter adjustment, panel access required)
- **TK4**: NFC wireless configuration via smartphone app (no panel opening)

**Connectivity:**
- **TK3+**: None (standalone operation, local control only)
- **TK4**: Modbus RS485 for BMS/SCADA integration

**What's Identical:**
- Same IR optical sensor technology
- Same pressure ratings (46/80/130 bar variants)
- Same automatic valve operation
- Same refrigerant compatibility

**Choose TK3+ when**: Basic automatic control sufficient, no BMS integration needed, cost priority (50-80% less expensive)

**Choose TK4 when**: BMS/SCADA integration required, NFC smartphone config preferred, remote monitoring needed

### 7.2 Operation & Configuration

**Q4: How does automatic operation work?**
1. Sensor monitors oil level continuously
2. Level drops → valve opens automatically → oil flows from separator to crankcase
3. Level rises to setpoint → valve closes automatically
4. If level stays low despite valve open → alarm relay activates (60-120 sec delay)

**Q5: Does it need programming?**
No. Factory programmed and ready to operate. Just connect power and relay output. No PLC, no configuration software, no field adjustments.

**Q6: Can I adjust setpoints?**
No. TK3+ uses factory setpoints optimized for compressor crankcase operation. For field-adjustable setpoints, use TK4 model with NFC configuration.

**Q7: What does MOPD mean?**
MOPD = **Maximum Operating Pressure Differential** (separator pressure minus crankcase pressure).

**Example**: 30 bar separator - 10 bar crankcase = 20 bar differential

TK3+ 46 bar handles up to 26 bar MOPD.

### 7.3 Installation

**Q8: What is dual LEFT/RIGHT mounting?**
The same TK3+ unit can mount on either left or right side of the compressor. Electronic module and valve rotate to match installation orientation. This eliminates need for separate left/right models (50% inventory reduction).

**Q9: Do I need adapters?**
Yes. Adapters are **sold separately** and match TK3+ to specific compressor flange types (3/4/6-hole). See Teklab Adapters Addendum for selection guide.

**Q10: Can it replace my sight-glass?**
Yes. TK3+ mounts directly to sight-glass flange locations. The fused glass dome allows visual inspection while also providing automatic electronic control.

**Q11: What clearances are needed?**
- **Above**: 120-150mm (for electronic module removal during service)
- **Sides**: 80mm (for cable/piping access)
- **Below**: 30mm minimum (glass dome immersion)

### 7.4 Service & Maintenance

**Q12: What is two-part serviceable design?**
- **Part 1** (permanent): Sensor adapter + valve body (stays on compressor)
- **Part 2** (replaceable): Electronic module + coil (remove/replace in 5-10 min **without depressurizing**)

Most failures (electronics, sensor, coil) = quick component replacement without system downtime.

**Q13: How do I replace electronic module?**
1. Disconnect power
2. Remove mounting screws
3. Lift off electronic module
4. Install new module
5. Reconnect power

**Time**: 5-10 minutes, no refrigerant recovery needed.

**Q14: What maintenance is required?**
- **Quarterly**: Visual inspection (check for leaks, verify LED indication)
- **Annually**: Functional test (verify valve operation, relay output)
- **No scheduled component replacement** (only replace if failed)

### 7.5 Pressure & Applications

**Q15: Which TK3+ variant for CO2 systems?**
- **CO2 subcritical** (differential < 26 bar): TK3+ 46 bar (rare, typically need 80 bar)
- **CO2 subcritical** (differential 30-50 bar): TK3+ 80 bar
- **CO2 transcritical** (differential > 50 bar): TK3+ 130 bar

**Q16: Can I use TK3+ 46 bar for CO2 subcritical?**
Only if differential < 26 bar (rare). Most CO2 subcritical systems require TK3+ 80 bar due to 40-50 bar typical differentials.

**Q17: R410A hot climate - which model?**
R410A at 50°C condensing creates ~30 bar differential. Use **TK3+ 80 bar** for safety margin (MOPD 52 bar). TK3+ 46 bar works but operates at maximum rating (less safe).

**Q18: What does "46 bar / 80 bar / 130 bar" mean?**
This is the **maximum working pressure** the TK3+ can withstand. It refers to the separator/crankcase pressure, NOT the differential.

**Example**: TK3+ 80 bar can handle 70 bar separator pressure with 20 bar crankcase (50 bar differential, within 52 bar MOPD).

### 7.6 Multi-Compressor Systems

**Q19: Can I use TK3+ for multiple compressors?**
Yes. Install one TK3+ per compressor. Each operates independently.

**Power**: 3 compressors = 60VA (use 100VA transformer), 6 compressors = 120VA (use 150VA transformer)

**Q20: Wire relays in series or parallel?**
**Series** (for safety chain): All NC contacts in series with compressor contactors. Any TK3+ alarm → stops all compressors.

### 7.7 Troubleshooting

**Q21: Valve won't open - what to check?**
- Power supply connected and correct voltage?
- Check LED indication (should show yellow when filling)
- Verify oil supply pressure differential adequate (need > 5 bar minimum)
- Check for blockage in oil return line
- Coil may be failed (replace coil without depressurizing)

**Q22: Alarm activates immediately**
- Oil separator empty or pressure too low
- Oil return line blocked
- Pressure differential insufficient (< 5 bar)
- Valve stuck closed (service valve)

**Q23: How to verify correct operation?**
- **Green LED**: Normal (oil level adequate, valve closed)
- **Yellow LED**: Filling (valve open, oil flowing)
- **Red LED**: Alarm (low oil persists)
- **Relay**: NC contact closed during normal, opens on alarm
- **Oil level**: Should stabilize and remain steady

### 7.8 Refrigerant Compatibility

**Q24: What refrigerants work with TK3+?**
- **TK3+ 46 bar**: R134a, R404A, R407C, R410A, R290, R600a, CO2 subcritical (if MOPD < 26 bar), Ammonia (approval required)
- **TK3+ 80 bar**: All above + CO2 subcritical, R410A hot climate
- **TK3+ 130 bar**: All above + CO2 transcritical

**Q25: What oils work with TK3+?**
All oils: Mineral, POE, PAG, AB, and all synthetic oils. Fused glass and nickel-plated steel provide universal compatibility.

**Q26: Can I use TK3+ with Ammonia?**
Consult Teklab engineering for approval. Materials compatible but application review recommended.
