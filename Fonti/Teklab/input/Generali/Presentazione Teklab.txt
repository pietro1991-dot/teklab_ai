In 2019, Teklab secured funding through the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator under Horizon 2020 for the TEM (Teklab Evaporator Management) project. This initiative aimed to develop an innovative system for optimizing evaporator performance in refrigeration and air conditioning, targeting a 15% reduction in energy consumption, 25% decrease in refrigerant charge, and lower system complexity and manufacturing costs. The project, valued for its potential in sustainable cooling, ran from 2017 to 2025 and highlighted Teklab's role in energy-efficient technologies.
2020s: Achieved UL recognition for the entire family of oil level regulators, a significant milestone for market access in North America. Expanded presence at global events, including ATMOsphere conferences (e.g., ATMO America 2023-2024, ATMO Europe), Euroshop 2023, and AHR Expo 2023-2024. In 2024, Teklab exhibited at Chillventa in Nuremberg (Hall 7, Booth 7-439), showcasing solutions for natural refrigerants. The company has also sponsored World Refrigeration Day and aligned with eco-friendly initiatives, reflecting a commitment to sustainability.

Over the decades, Teklab has evolved from a local electronics firm to a global exporter, with a workforce focused on R&D and production. Its history is marked by consistent innovation in response to environmental regulations, such as the phase-out of high-GWP refrigerants, positioning it as a forward-thinking entity in the green technology space.
