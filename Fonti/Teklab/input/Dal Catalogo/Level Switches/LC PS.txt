Optical Level Control Unit  
40
LC-PS up to 46 bar 
Main Features   
• The absence of mechanical moving parts ensures   
High reliability  
• Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology    
ensures no leakage and good chemical compati 
bility   
• Electronic sensor can be easily replaced without  
emptying and/or depressurizing the plant due to 
the two parts design 
• No need for calibrations on the field   
• Direct mounting onto various types of compressors      
(M20x1.5 or 1”1/8 – 18 UNEF adapter) and tanks 
(1/2”NPT adapter), etc... 
• Customizable delays on request 
• Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and  
2014/35/UE. 
Application Description 
The optical level switch LC-PS has been designed for use in level monitoring applications for the control of low viscosity liquids. It comprises an optical sensor and an output switch. It is realized in two parts to let it possible to replace the electronics without the needing  of emptying or depressurizing the plant. 
The sensor is suitable as minimum or maximum alarm. 
Delays can be introduced in order to satisfy particular needing or avoid false alarms. 
Operating Principle 
  
  

The sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.
