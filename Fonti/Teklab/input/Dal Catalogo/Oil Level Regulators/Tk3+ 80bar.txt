TK3+ @80 bar 
Oil Level Regulator 
  
CONNECTORS VERSION TWO MOUNTING POSSIBILITIES WITH THE SAME PRODUCT (LEFT/RIGHT) 
Some advantages of this solution: 
• Extremely compact dimensions  
• Left/Right mounting possibility with the same TK3+ • Reduction of the number of junctions in the circuit with less possibility of having leakages 
• Usage of less components (simplified circuit and easier warehouse management) 
• Simplified Installation (cost savings in terms of installation time). 
Main Features 
• High reliability ensured by absence of mechanical moving parts. 
• Sight glass and electronic LEDs can be checked on the same side  where is more comfortable to do inspections. 
• Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology with absence of seals ensures no leakage and good chemical compatibility. 
• Direct sight glass replacement (3/4/6 holes flange connection). • 24 VAC / 230 VAC power supply options. 
Application Description 
CABLE GLANDS VERSION   
TWO MOUNTING POSSIBILITIES WITH THE SAME PRODUCT (LEFT/RIGHT)     
Integrated filtering element in series  
with the valve. 
Please contact Teklab for more info. 
• Easy maintenance of the coil of the valve and of the Electro Optic sensor that can be easily replaced without emptying or depressurizing the plant. 
• 230 VAC /2A alarm relay output suitable for direct connection in  the security chain of the system. 
• Adapters suitable for various types of compressors. • Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and 2014/35/UE. 
HIGH PRESSURE OIL RETURN LINE SYSTEM EXAMPLE 
The TK3+ is designed to control the oil level in the compressor  crankcase in order to avoid the compressor to run without oil and so  improve its lifetime. TK3+ monitors the oil level with the embedded  electro-optic sensor and comprises a solenoid valve for oil filling  and a relay output contact to give an alarm.
