Innovative Communication  8
Technology 
NANO INTERFACE 
  

Main Features 
TK4 combines the established reliability and ease of installation of  TK3 and TK3+ with revolutionary connectivity capabilities which  opens new and interesting usage scenarios for the product. TK4 in fact integrates a wireless near field communication protocol that allows users to interact with the oil level regulator to expand  product’s features. 
The communication technology adopted is: 
• Extremely easy-to-use: data accessible without disassembling  enclosures and connecting cables. 
• Powered / not powered operating: several information accessible  also when the electronics is not powered (useful for quick and  easy in-house customization). 
• Highly compact and cost effective: the product keeps its very  compact design and there is no need for expensive devices. • Highly safe: password protected point to point single link with  limited range of operation to avoid unwanted changes from  unauthorized personnel. 
• Really Flexible: possibility of modifying functioning parameters  and verify working conditions (also in real time) to optimize  system’s operation. 
• Open for the future: Teklab is continuously in contact with  customers for adding features to the product. 
Typical applications are: 
• verification of product operation status and system operating conditions during  normal maintenance operations.

• functioning timings customization. • alarm timings customization. 
Note. Customizations possible both “off line” (factory setting before shipping and installation) and “on line” (on the field system  adjustment / optimization).

TK4MB

Enhanced Oil Level Regulator 
with integrated Modbus RTU Connectivity Main Features 
TK4-MB combines the established reliability and ease of installation  of TK3+ with revolutionary flexibility of standard TK4 extending  its connectivity capabilities through the introduction of wired serial  interface based on Modbus RTU protocol.  
TK4-MB in fact integrates two possibilities of communication interface: • A wired serial interface based on Modbus RTU protocol. • A wireless near field communication protocol that allows users to  interact easily and directly with the oil level regulator using a Windows  based PC or an Android device (Mobile Phone or Tablet). 
The TK4-MB is designed to be connected to widely diffused Modbus  RTU networks as a slave node opening the possibility of having the  availability of info about working conditions of the product and thus  of the system. Consequently it is possible to have remote monitoring  of the compressor pack even further reliable and effective letting it  possible to optimize systems performances, to prevent and manage  alarms and to elaborate accurate maintenance plans. 
Here is an example of typical connection: 
  

Reading and Writing Register Commands are processed according to  standard Modbus RTU protocol (www.modbus.org) to allow easy inte gration and maximum flexibility. 
Example of parameters accessible on the serial bus are: Valve and  Alarm contact status, Functioning Timings, Time to Alarm, Logging  info, etc.

The wireless proximity communication with the TK4 is established simply connecting the supplied USB  
dongle to the PC or to the Android device (Tablet or Smartphone) and launching the dedicated App. 
This solution is:  
•  Extremely easy-to-use: data accessible without disassembling enclosures and connecting cables. 
•  Powered / not powered operating: several information accessible also when the electronics is not 
powered (useful for quick and easy in-house customization).  
•   Highly compact and cost effective: the product keeps its very compact design and there is no need 
for expensive devices.  
•  Highly safe: password protected point to point single link with limited range of operation to avoid 
unwanted changes from unauthorized personnel.  
•  Really Flexible: possibility of modifying functioning parameters and verify working conditions (also 
in real time) to optimize system’s operation.  
•  Open for the future: Teklab is continuously in contact with 
customers for adding features to the product.   
It can be used for direct customization of working parameters and working serial settings of the Modbus protocol (like Device Address, baud  rate, etc) letting it very easy to integrate the product on any system.  
  
  

  

Typical applications are: 
• verification of product operation status and system operating conditions from  remote control rooms (using Modbus  interface).  
• verification of product operation status and system operating conditions during  normal maintenance operations directly  on the unit without the needing of any  connection (using wireless interface). 
• functioning timings customization for system’s optimization. 
• alarm timings customization for better system’s monitoring.
