Please contact Teklab for more info. Some advantages of this solution: \n• Modbus RTU Serial connection to system controller • Extremely compact dimensions  \n• Left/Right mounting possibility with the same TK4-MB • Reduction of the number of junctions in the circuit with less possibility of having leakages \nMain Features \n• High reliability ensured by absence of mechanical moving parts. • Sight glass and electronic LEDs can be checked on the same side  where is more comfortable to do inspections. • Well consolidated steel with fused glass technology with absence of seals ensures no leakage and good chemical compatibility. • Direct sight glass replacement (3/4/6 holes flange connection). • 24 VAC / 230 VAC power supply options. Application Description \n• Usageof lesscomponents(simplified circuit and easier warehouse management) \n• Simplified Installation (cost savings in terms of installation time) • Revolutionary connectivity capabilities. • Easy maintenance of the coil of the valve and of the Electro Optic sensor that can be easily replaced without emptying or depressurizing the plant. • 230 VAC /2A alarm relay output suitable for direct connection in  the security chain of the system. • Adapters suitable for various types of compressors. • Unit conform to directives 2014/30/UE and 2014/35/UE.
