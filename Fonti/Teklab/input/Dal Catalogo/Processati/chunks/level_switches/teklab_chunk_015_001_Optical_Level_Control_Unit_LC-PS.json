Application Description \nThe optical level switch LC-PS has been designed for use in level monitoring applications for the control of low viscosity liquids. It comprises an optical sensor and an output switch. It is realized in two parts to let it possible to replace the electronics without the needing  of emptying or depressurizing the plant. The sensor is suitable as minimum or maximum alarm. Delays can be introduced in order to satisfy particular needing or avoid false alarms. Operating Principle \n  \n  \n\nThe sensor contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the  liquid and the sensor senses its presence.
