TK1+ series is especially designed for use in level monitoring for HVAC&R market. TK1+ can be mounted directly on the crankcase of the compressor, on the oil reservoir, oil separator or liquid receiver. This product is very reliable and suitable for working in heavy environments. LEDs integrated in the electronic module allow to verify the liquid status. The two parts design allows the fast replacement of the electronic parts without depressurizing the system. The electronic module of the TK1+ contains an infrared-ray emitter and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted  is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the liquid and the sensor senses its presence.
