Advantage TK3+: available in 3 pressure versions (46/80/130 bar) for full application coverage with UNICO SKU. Danfoss requires separate models. TK3+ has built-in solenoid valve for automatic plugging + alarm relay for compressor protection. Technological level: EQUIVALENT. Setup: easier TK3+ (full stand-alone solution). Application: Oil level control compressors HFC/HFO, ammonia, CO2 Q: What pressure versions TK3+ exist and when to use them?A: TK3+ available in 3 versions: 1) 46 bar - Standard HFC/HFO systems (R134a, R404A, R410A, R407C). 2) 80 bar - ammonia R717 (food industrial plants). 3) 130 bar - transcritical CO2 R744 (supermarkets, cold storage). Advantage: same mechanical design, same installation, only differential pressure difference supported. Reduces SKU warehouse and simplifies product selection. Application: Any low-to-high-pressure refrigeration application Q: TK3+ vs Emerson OLR: Which one has better diagnostics?A: Emerson OLR has advanced built-in diagnostic versions (superior), but TK3+ offers 3 multi-application pressure versions (more versatile). Trade-off: Emerson better for sophisticated monitoring, TK3+ better for versatility and stock reduction. TK3+ has standard alarm relay for basic protection. Technological level: TK3+ EQUIVALENT for basic adjustment, Emerson Superior for advanced diagnostics. Application: TK3+ for standard applications, Emerson for critical plants with Q monitoring: Can TK3+ replace mechanical Alco OLR? A: Yes, TK3+ replaces Alco OLR with significant technological upgrade. Alco OLR uses mechanical float (mobile parts, wear, false alarms), TK3+ uses electronic capacitive optical sensor (no moving part, greater precision, 2x duration). Retrofit: Easy - standard compressor threads. Technological level: SUPERIORE (electronic vs mechanical floating).Application: Upgrade compressors with mechanical OLR legacy Q: How does automatic oil filling TK3+ work?A: TK3+ integrates optical level sensor + solenoid valve + logic electronic control. Operation: 1) Sensor detects oil level dropped below threshold. 2) Active electronic solenoid valve to open the plug line. 3) Oil flows from reserve to compressor carter. 4) Sensor detects restored level, closes valve. 5) If level remains low (anomaly), activate alarm relay for compressor protection. All automatic 24/7, no manual intervention. Application: Compressors with low oil risk (long plants, racks) Advantages Competitive: UNIQUE with 3 pressure versions (46/80/130 bar) = 100% coverage applications with reduction SKU 66%. Electronic optical sensor superior to mechanical competitors (Alco). Complete stand-alone solution (sensor + valve + integrated alarm). Equivalence to premium electronic brands (Danfoss, Emerson base). Easy Retrofit: Easy - Standard compressor threads, simple electrical connections (universal SPDT relay). Minimum configuration required. .",
