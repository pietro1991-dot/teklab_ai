Both are digital capacitive sensors with comparable performance. LC-PS advantages: simpler setup, stable digital signal. Retrofit: Easy - standard thread 1/4\" SAE or M10x1, universal 12-24V DC power supply, 2-wire wiring. Technology level: EQUIVALENT. Application: Standard refrigeration systems HFC/HFO up to 46 bar Q: I have an Alco FS-C installed, can I replace it with Teklab? A: Yes, the Teklab LC-PS replaces Alco FS-C/FS-J with technological advantage: Alco uses mechanical microswitch (wear over time), LC-PS is capacitive electronic (no mobile part, longer life). Retrofit: Direct - same thread. Technological level: SUPERIORE (electronic vs mechanical). Application: Mechanical to electronic control Upgrade Q: Difference LC-PS vs Sporlan OLS-C? A: Both digital electronics with PNP/NPN output. Equivalent benefits. LC-PS offers universal PLC compatibility and simplified setup. Direct retrofit thanks to common industrial standards. Technological level: EQUIVALENT. Application: Standard oil level control Competitive advantages: Electronic capacitive technology (superior to mechanical competitors such as Alco, Saginomiya). Equivalent to premium brands (Danfoss, Emerson) with simpler setup. Universal PLC compatibility. Easy Retrofit: Easy - Standard threads, universal voltage 12-24V DC, 2 wires.",
