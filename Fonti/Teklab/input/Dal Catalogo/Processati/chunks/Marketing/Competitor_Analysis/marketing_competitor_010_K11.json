  "original_text": "COMPETITOR COMPARISON: K11 Category: Marketing - Sensor Comparison Competitor Equivalent: Danfoss AKS 33/38, Alco ELS, Sporlan ELS-C, Saginimiya SNS-C110 Q: What is the __TECH15_ and what is its unique feature?A: __TECH15_ is a compact capacitive level sensor (60 bar) with OUTPUT COMPETITOR. Unique feature: SINGLE device configurable as NPN, PNP or AC via integrated DIP switch. Competitor (_TECH14_, __TECH8_, Sporlan) require order 3 separate versions. Advantage K11: reduction SKU 66% (1 product instead of 3 in stock), universal PLC compatibility (sink/source/relay), simplified retrofit (same part for any plant). Technology level: Superior for smart design. Application: Generic industrial applications refrigeration/HV_AC 60 bar Q: How do I configure output K11 NPN/PNP/_AC? A: K11 has DIP internal switch accessible (front screen). Configuration: 1) Unscrew front cover. 2) DIP switch set: Position 1-2 = NPN (sink, common negative), Position 3-4 = PNP (source, common positive), Position 5-6 = AC (relay output, universal). 3) Close lid. Time: 2 minutes. No special tools needed. Configuration keeps memory (no battery, mechanical). Check PLC type first (sink or source) to set up correctly. Application: On-site adaptive setup to existing system Q: K11 vs Danfoss AKS 33: Why is K11 more versatile? A: Danfoss AKS 33 available in separate versions: AKS 33-NPN, AKS 33-NPP (you have to order specific version). __TECH15_ is UNIQUE device configurable for all 3 outputs. Practical benefits: 1) __TECH6_arehouse: stock 1 SKU instead of 3 (realised capital reduction). 2) Retrofit: same device works for any replacement (no order errors). 3) Flexibility: On-site configuration change in 2 minutes if PLC changes. Sensor technology level: EQUIV_ALENT (both capacitive). Design level: SUPERIORE (smart configurability). Application: Distributors with reduced stock, multi-client installers Q: K11 AC output: when to use it? A: Output AC (relay) is universal, works with any PLC/controller (_TECH37__C/DC, any voltage within 24-250V limits). Use AC when: 1) PLC type unknown (universal). 2) Mixed voltages implant. 3) It requires total galvanic isolation (relay fully sensor-insulated from PLC). AC fail: maximum current 2__TECH37_ (NPN/PNP up to 200mA). If load >2A serves external relay. AC is the safest choice for retrofit legacy plants where PLC specifications are not clear. Application: Retrofit old plants with missing documentation Q: ROI K11 configurable output: concrete savings? A: Distributor/installer savings: STOCK REDUCTION: 1 SKU K11 vs 3 SKU (NPN/PNP/_TECH37__C separated) = -66% stock immobilized warehouse. ERROR ELIMINATION ORDER: No risk ordering wrong version (cost reorder + project delay). FLEXIBILITY RETROFIT: Same device for any replacement (reduction parts inventory). CONCRETE EXAMPLE: Distributor with stock 30 sensors for 10 customers. Traditional: 10 NPN + 10 PNP + 10 AC = 30 pieces. __TECH6_ith __TECH15_: 30 pieces configurable = same cover with great flexibility. ROI: Reduction 66% risk obsolescence + 100% flexibility. Application: Business case for distributors and multi-customer installers Competitive Benefits: OUTPUT CONFIGUABLE 3-in-1 (NPN/PNP/AC) UNIQUE in the standard level sensors market. SKU 66% reduction, PLC universal compatibility, order error deletion. Capacitive sensor technology equivalent to premium brands. Compact design M18x1 industrial standard thread. Easy Retrofit: Maximum - Thread M18x1 industrial standard. Configurable output = suitable for any installation. Installation 5 min + DIP switch configuration 2 min. .",
