Materials: 316L stainless steel (compatible R744). Connectivity: LC-PH offers DOUBLE cable option + M12 IP67, Danfoss only M12. Retrofit: Easy - standard thread 7/16\" UNF-20 or M14x1.5 (CO2 standard), M12 connector A-coded plug-and-play. Technological level: EQUIVALENT. Certification EN 12263 compliant. Application: High pressure transcritical CO2 systems, supermarkets, logistics centers Q: LC-PH can replace Emerson PSL in CO2 retrofit? A: Yes, the Teklab LC-PH is compatible with Emerson PSL Series (130 bar). LC-PH supports up to 120 bars, suitable for most CO2 applications. LC-PH advantage: M12 IP67 connector available for heavy industrial environments. Direct retrofit with same standard CO2 threads. Technology level: EQUIVALENT. Application: Retrofit existing CO2 plants Q: Difference LC-PH vs HBControls HL-CO2? A: Both specialist CO2 with comparable pressures (LC-PH 120 bar, HBControls 140 bar). Equivalent capacitive sensor technology. HBControls is specialized German brand CO2, Teklab offers connector flexibility (cable + M12). Retrofit direct. Technology level: EQUIVALENT. Application: Subcritical and transcritical CO2 systems Q: LC-PH vs Carel LEVCO2: Which one to choose? A: Carel LEVCO2 (150 bar) has RS485 integrated for bus supervision, LC-PH is digital standalone. Choosing depends on architecture: if you need native PLC/SCADA integration, Carel is higher (tech level RIGHTLY HIGHER). If you need plug-and-play standalone solution, LC-PH is more practical for retrofit (easier installation, no bus configuration). Retrofit LC-PH: Easy, Carel: Medium (Requires RS485) configuration. Application: LC-PH for fast retrofit, Carel for supervised systems Competitive Benefits: Double connectivity option (cable + M12) unique in this category. Materials 316L certified CO2. Pressure 120 bar suitable for 95% transcritical applications. Technological equivalent to premium brands. Easy Retrofit: Easy - Standard CO2 thread (7/16\" UNF-20, M14x1.5), M12 A-coded plug-and-play, EN 12263 certification.",
