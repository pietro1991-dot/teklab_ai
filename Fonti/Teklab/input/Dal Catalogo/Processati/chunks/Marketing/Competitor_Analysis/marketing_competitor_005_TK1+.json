    "original_text": "COMPETITOR COMPETITOR: TK1+ Category: Marketing - Level Switch Comparison Competitor Equivalent: Danfoss OLS-H, Emerson OLS, Alco FS-J, Sporlan ORIT Q: TK1+ can directly replace light-glass compressor? A: Yes, TK1+ is specifically designed for retrofit sight-glass (glass level indicators). Assembly: 100% drop-in - glass sight-glass screws, TK1+ screwed (standard thread M18x1.5 or 3/4\" UNF-16). Installation time: 10-15 minutes. Transform manual visual inspection into 24/7 automatic monitoring with electronic alarm. Pressure: 100 bar (adapted for 90% compressors). Technology level: COMPETITOR EQUIVALENT (Danfoss OLS-H, Emerson OLS). Application: Upgrade compressors with sight-glass legacy Q: Difference TK1+ vs Danfoss OLS-H? A: Both designed for retrofit sight-glass compressors. TK1+ supports 100 bars, Danfoss OLS-H 90 bars. TK1+ has higher pressure (+10 bar). Both have SPDT relays configurable NO/NC for universal alarm. Technological level: EQUIVALENT. Retrofit: Direct for both (same standard compressor threads). Application: Compressors Bitzer, Copeland, Frascold with sight-glass Q: TK1+ vs Alco FS-J: Which is better? A: TK1+ uses electronic optical sensor, Alco FS-J uses mechanical microswitch. TK1+ has a longer life (100k+ cycles, no mechanical wear), Alco has moving parts subject to wear. TK1+ has superior vibration resistance (important on compressors). Technological level: Superior (electronic vs mechanical). Retrofit: Easy for both. Application: Compressors with high vibrations Q: How do I configure alarm TK1+ NO or NC? A: TK1+ has configurable relay Normally Open (NO) or Normally Closed (NC) via internal jumper or DIP switch (check specific model). NO: Active alarm when low level. NC: alarm active when level OK (fail-safe). Compatible with any 250V AC / 2A electrical panel. Test polarity before connecting central alarm. Application: Integration centralized alarm systems Advantages Competitive: Pressure 100 bar (over Danfoss OLS-H 90 bar, Alco FS-J 70 bar). Electronic optical technology superior to mechanical competitors. Native design for retrofit sight-glass (100% drop-in). Transform manual inspection into automatic monitoring. Easy Retrofit: Direct drop-in - Standard compressor threads M18x1.5 or 3/4\" UNF-16. Installation 10-15 min. Compatible: Bitzer, Copeland, Frascold, Dorin. .",
