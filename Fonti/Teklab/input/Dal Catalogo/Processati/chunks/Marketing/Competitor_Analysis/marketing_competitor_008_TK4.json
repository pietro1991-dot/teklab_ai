It maintains all functions TK3+ (optical sensor, integrated valve, alarm) + adds NFC for setup/diagnostic via Android/iOS smartphone. EXCLUSIVE INNOVATION Teklab. Advantages: configure parameters in 30 seconds (vs 10 minutes with traditional DIP switches), advanced diagnostics (historical alarms, bouncing cycles), no need to open electrical panel. Technology level: UPPER for user interface. Application: Quick field maintenance, fast commissioning Q: TK4 NFC vs Danfoss AKS 4100 BLE: Which one to choose? A: Both wireless, but different technologies. TK4 uses NFC (tap&go <5cm, no pairing, also works with off device), Danfoss uses BLE Bluetooth (range ~10m, requires pairing, device needs to be switched on). Trade-off: BLE has greatest range (distance monitoring), safer NFC (impossible to intercept from distance) and simpler (instant tap). Technological level: PARTIAL - BLE best for range, NFC best for simplicity/security. Choosing depends on use case. Application: TK4 for quick configuration on-site, Danfoss for remote monitoring Q: What parameters can I configure with NFC __TECH16_ app? A: Parameters configurable via NFC app: 1) Late alarm: 10-300 seconds (avoid fake transient alarms). 2) Bubble time: 5-120 seconds (adapted to oil line flow rate). 3) Level threshold: 10-90% (customize for specific carter). 4) Diagnostic visualization: historical alarms (timestamp), total number of bouncing cycles, real-time sensor status. Free Android/iOS app, no cloud subscription fee. Data stored locally in the device. Application: Fine customization for each Q compressor: Does TK4 work if your smartphone doesn't have NFC? A: No, it serves smartphones with integrated NFC chip (standard on 95% modern smartphones since 2020). Aternative: If you need to configure without NFC, use __TECH13_ (traditional configuration with DIP switch/jumper). TK4 also maintain default factory base configuration working out-of-box, __TECH40_ only serves for advanced customization. Application: Check smartphone compatibility before purchase Q: TK4 NFC ROI: Is investment worth vs __TECH13_? A: ROI depends on number of installations. Saving commissioning time: 30 sec (TK4 NFC) vs 10 min (_TECH13__ DIP switch) = 9.5 min saved per device. __TECH6_ith 10 devices: 95 min saved = 1.5 hours cold labor (90-150€ savings). More installations = greater ROI. Adictional advantage: Remote diagnostics reduces on-site visits to troubleshooting (transfer saving). Recommended for: installers with >5 devices, maintainers with distributed systems. Application: Large multi-compressor projects, retail chains Competitive advantages: FIRST oil regulator with wireless NFC on the market - exclusive innovation. Configuration 30 sec vs 10 min traditional (95% time saving). Advanced diagnostics (historical alarms, cycles). No cloud costs. Superior for ease of use, equivalent for oil regulation. Easy Retrofit: Maximum - Same retrofit TK3+ + benefit instant configuration NFC. Zero additional wiring for NFC (wireless). .",
