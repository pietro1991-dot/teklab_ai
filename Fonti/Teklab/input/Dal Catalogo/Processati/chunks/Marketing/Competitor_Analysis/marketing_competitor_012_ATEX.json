    "original_text": "COMPETITOR COMPARISON: ATEX Category: Marketing - Sensor Comparison Competitor Equivalent: Danfoss AKS 38 ATEX, Honeywell Smart Sensor ATEX, Saginomiya SNS-ATEX Q: What is the ATEX Teklab sensor and when is it mandatory?A: ATEX Teklab sensor is certified for areas with potentially explosive atmosphere (ATEX Ex ia IIC T4, Zone 0/1/2). Legal obligation when using flammable refrigerants Group A3 (ASHRAE 34): Propane R290 (commercial refrigeration), Isobutan R600a (domestic refrigerators), Ammon R717 (in certain configurations), Hydrogen (chemical/petrochemical industry). Certification guarantees electricity/thermal energy insufficient to trigger explosion even in failure. Pressure: 20 bar (appropriate for R290/R600a, check for ammonia). Output: Open Collector (compatible inherent safety barriers).Application: Commercial refrigeration R290, domestic appliances R600a, petrochemical industry Q: ATEX Teklab vs Danfoss AKS 38 ATEX: differences?A: Both ATEX certificates Ex ia IIC T4 (same intrinsic safety class, maximum protection also for more flammable gas IIC group as hydrogen). Danfoss supports 25 bar, Teklab 20 bar (minimum difference, both suitable for R290/R600a typically <15 bar). Technological level: EQUIVALENT. Output: both Open Collector. Selection based on: availability local stock, price (check distributors), familiarity installer with brand. Application: European ATEX compliance Q: ATEX Teklab vs Honeywell Smart Sensor ATEX: which one to choose? A: Honeywell Smart Sensor ATEX (30 bar) has advanced diagnostics NAMUR NE107 (autodiagnostic, signals fault sensor, wiring, power supply). Technological level: Superior for diagnostics. But significantly higher cost and requires NAMUR-compatible supervision system. Teklab ATEX is reliable basic solution, Open Collector universal, standard Zener barrier. Trade-off: Honeywell for critical plants with advanced supervision, Teklab for standard basic compliance applications. Application: Teklab for economical compliance, Honeywell for safety critical + diagnostic Q: Does ATEX sensor require intrinsic safety barrier? A: Yes, COMPULSORY. ATEX Ex ia sensor (intrinsic safety) must be connected via Zener barrier or certified isolator between dangerous zone (field) and safe zone (electric panel/PLC). Barrier limits maximum electricity that can reach explosive zone even in case of failure. Barrier cost: ~50-150€ depending on brand/specifics. Barrier must be installed in a safe area (electric panel) and certified for the same ATEX class as the sensor (Ex ia IIC). Complete ATEX certification system. Application: ATEX compliant installation with Q certified barrier: Which refrigerants require certified ATEX sensor? A: ASHRAE 34 Flammable Refrigerators: GROUP A3 (high flammability, low toxicity): R290 Propane (GWP 3, eco-friendly, commercial), R600a Isobutan (GWP 3, domestic), R1270 Propylene (industrial), R441A (carbon blend). GROUP A2L (light flammability): R32, R1234yf, R1234ze (new HFO, regulation may require precautions). GROUP B2 (Ammonisation R717 in certain configurations). Always check local regulations and specific plant risk assessment. Area ATEX classified by safety engineer. Application: Compliance with eco-friendly natural refrigerants Q: ATEX Teklab 20 bar: sufficient for ammonia R717? A: ammonia R717 typically operates 10-25 bar (high pressure side). ATEX Teklab 20 bar is limit, reduced margin. For RECOMMENDED ammonia use higher pressure sensor (40-60 bar) for safety. Max pressure check specific plant (depending on condensation temperature, system design). Alternative: Consider ATEX certified industrial sensors specific for ammonia with adequate pressure. ATEX Teklab optimal for R290/R600a (<15 bar), sufficient margin. Application: R290/R600a optimal, ammonia only if tested pressure <18 bar with margin Competitive advantages: ATEX Certification Ex ia IIC T4 complete (Zone 0/1/2, gas group IIC maximum protection). Equivalent to Danfoss/Saginomiya certified. Output Open Collector universal (compatible standard barriers). European compliance for natural flammable refrigerants (R290, R600a). Typically competitive cost vs premium brands. Easy Retrofit: Easy (technically) - Standard thread. WARNING: installation requires certified ATEX skills, mandatory safety barrier, full regulatory compliance. Installation time: +50% vs non-ATEX sensor for barrier wiring and verification. .",
