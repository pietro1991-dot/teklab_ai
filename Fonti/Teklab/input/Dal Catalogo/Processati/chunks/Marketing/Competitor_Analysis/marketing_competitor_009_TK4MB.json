    "original_text": "COMPETITOR COMPARISON: TK4MB Category: Marketing - Oil Regulator Comparison Competitor Equivalent: Danfoss AKS 4100 IoT, Carel LEV-BUS, Honeywell BACnet, Emerson E2 Cloud Q: What is TK4MB and who is it for?A: TK4MB is the most advanced oil level regulator in Teklab, designed for Industry 4.0 and IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things). Combine: TK4 complete (sensor + valve + NFC) + Modbus RTU (RS485) for PLC/SCADA/BMS integration. ONE INTERFACE TRIPLE: 1) Alarm relay (standard). 2) Wireless NFC (local configuration). 3) Modbus RTU (centralized supervision). Target: complex industrial plants, supermarkets, logistics centres, building automation. Application: Multi-compressor centralised supervision, predictive maintenance Q: TK4MB Modbus RTU vs Danfoss Modbus TCP/IP: differences? A: Different protocols, trade-off architecture. TK4MB uses Modbus RTU (RS485, 2 wires, max 1200m, robust, economical, no switch/router). Danfoss uses Modbus TCP/IP (Ethernet, network infrastructure, expensive switches, greater flexibility, IT integration). Technological level: Danfoss TCP/IP RIGHTLY HIGHER for speed/flexibility, but TK4MB RTU HIGHER for industrial strength and cost. Choosing depends on: has Ethernet already installed? Budget? Does it need maximum robustness (RS485) or IT integration (TCP/IP)? Application: TK4MB for plants without Ethernet, Danfoss for IT-integrated plants Q: TK4MB is compatible with which PLC/SCADA? A: Modbus RTU universal compatibility (global industrial standard). Compatible PLCs: Siemens S7 (1200/1500), Schneider Modecon, Allen-Bradley ControlLogix, Omron CJ/NJ, Mitsubishi FX/Q. Compatible SCADA: Siemens WinCC, Wonderware InTouch, Rockwell FactoryTalk, Ignition by Inductive Automation. Compatible BMS: Tridium Niagara, Siemens Desigo, Schneider EcoStruxure, TAC Vista. Baud rate configurable: 9600/19200/38400 bps. Max 32 RS485 bus devices. Application: Integration into existing industrial automation Q: TK4MB vs Honeywell BACnet/IP: Which for building automation? A: BACnet/IP is the most advanced building automation protocol (more technological level than Modbus), but requires expensive Ethernet infrastructure and IT skills. TK4MB Modbus RTU is simpler, more robust, cheaper. Trade-off: Honeywell best for modern building with BMS native BACnet, TK4MB best for retrofit existing plants without Ethernet or where budget is limited. For modern BMS: consider Modbus gateway→BACnet (hybrid solution). Application: TK4MB for retrofit, Honeywell for new high-end constructions Q: TK4MB vs Emerson E2 Cloud: local or cloud? A: Opposite architectures. TK4MB is edge/local (Modbus RTU on-premises, zero latency, no internet dependency, no subscription costs). Emerson E2 is cloud-based (advanced analytics, global remote access, mobile dashboards, but requires connectivity, subscriptions, higher latency). Technology level: Superior Emerson for analytics/remote flexibility, but Superior TK4MB for real-time/reliability/cost. Trade-off: cloud for global visibility and predictive maintenance AI, local for real-time control and independence. Application: TK4MB for real-time critical plants, Emerson for multi-site fleet management Q: What data does TK4MB display via Modbus? A: Modbus RTU (Holding + Input): 1) Real-time oil level (%). 2) Boosting valve condition (open/closed). 3) Active alarm (bool). 4) Number of total bulk cycles (counter). 5) Timestamp last hug. 6) Sensor state (OK/fault). 7) Remote configurable parameters (delay alarm, threshold, etc.). WRITE possible for some parameters (remote configuration). Typical Polling rate: 1-10 seconds (configurable SCADA).Application: 24/7 monitoring + predictive maintenance based on trend cycles Competitive advantages: Single INTERFACE TRIPLE (Relè + NFC + Modbus RTU) = maximum flexibility. Robust and economical Modbus RTU vs TCP/IP competitor. NFC for quick local setup (vantage vs bus-only competitor). Local vs. cloud (zero latency, no subscriptions). Ideal Industry 4.0 pragmatic. Easy Retrofit: Medium - Easy mechanical Retrofit (compressor standard). Electric retrofit requires RS485 cable (2 additional wires) + Modbus ID/baud rate configuration. Time: 30-45 min for installation + PLC integration. .",
