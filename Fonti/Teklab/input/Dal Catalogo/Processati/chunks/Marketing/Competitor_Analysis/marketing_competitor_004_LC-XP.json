Both industrial IP67. DIN Benefits: more widespread in aftermarket EU, cheaper cables (50% cost vs M12), larger spare parts stock. M12 most common in USA/OEM. Sensor technology level: EQUIVALENT. Retrofit: Easy for both. Choosing depends on existing standard installation and availability of cables. Application: EU market transcritical CO2 with DIN Q standard: LC-XP is the only level DIN switch at 120 bar? A: Yes, LC-XP is UNIQUE on the market with DIN 43650-A connector at 120 bar. High Pressure CO2 Competitor all use M12 (Danfoss, HBControls, Emerson). EXCLUSIVE INNOVATION Teklab - discovery niche. Advantage: EU coolers are more familiar with DIN, cheaper and locally available cables. Application: CO2 EU plants where DIN is corporate standard Q: Can I replace Emerson PSL M12 with LC-XP DIN? A: Yes, but you need to change cable from M12 to DIN. Mechanical retrofit: Easy (same standard CO2 thread 7/16\" UNF-20). Electric Retrofit: Needs new DIN cable (~15€, 20 min installation). Trade-off currency: Cable initial cost vs future benefits DIN (economy, availability). Technological level sensor: EQUIVALENT. Application: Standardization system on DIN connector Advantages Competitive: SINGLE PRODUCT: only level switch DIN at 120 bar on the market. All high pressure CO2 competitors use M12. Advantage EU market: DIN cheaper, available, familiar to technicians. Materials 316L CO2-ready. Easy Retrofit: Easy - Standard CO2 thread. If the installation already has DIN: Snapshot. If installation has M12: Medium (serve new DIN cable). .",
