  "original_text": "COMPETITOR COMPARISON: Rotalock Category: Marketing - Level Switch Comparison Competitor Equivalent: NO - Unique Product Q: What is the Rotalock Teklab switch and why is it unique?A: Rotalock switch __TECH32_ is the UNICO level switch on the market with direct native mounting on __TECH21_ valves (standard omnipresent in liquid receivers and compressors). NO COMPETITOR offers equivalent - EXCLUSIVE INNOV___TECH37_TION. Completely eliminates the need for Rotalock adapters→NPT/SAE, additional gaskets, fittings. Advantages: installation 5 min vs 45 min with adapters, zero additional loss points, reduction of material cost + labor. Application: Liquid receivers, compressors with __TECH21_ Q valves: How do I install Rotalock switch? Need adapter? __TECH37_: NO, no adapter needed. Direct assembly: 1) Close Rotalock valve. 2) Remove Rotalock blind cap. 3) Screw Rotalock switch directly (compatible native thread). 4) Connect DIN 43650-A electrical connector. Total time: 5 minutes. Saving vs traditional method with adapters: ~90-150€ labor + 30-40€ installation materials. Application: Fast retrofit without extended system stop Q: Rotalock switch is compatible with valves of which brand? A: Compatible with standard Rotalock valves of all major brands: Sporlan, Castel, Parker, Emerson/_TECH8_, Danfoss EVR_A/EVRST/EV_R series. Rotalock thread is a standard global industrial. Supported pressure: 46 bar (adapted for HFC/HFO standard systems). Output: Digital via DIN 43650-A_ connector. Application: All refrigeration systems with Rotalock Q valves: What economic benefits does Rotalock switch offer? A: ROI immediate appeared to traditional installation with adapters: SA_VING MATERIALS: Rotalock→NPT adapter (~30€) + Seals (~5€) = 35€. DOUBLE SA__VING: 1.5 hours fridge (90-150€ depending on geographical area). RISK REDUCTION: -50% loss points (1 connection vs 2). TOTAL SA_VING: 125-185€ per installation + safety benefit (less cooling losses). Payback: Immediate on first installation. Application: Projects with multiple installations, large plants Competitive advantages: SINGLE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET - absolute competitive advantage. No competitor offers native Rotalock motive. Deletetes adapters, reduces losses, saves time/cost. Exclusive Teklab innovation. Easy Retrofit: Maximum - Direct assembly native, zero adapters, 5 min installation.
