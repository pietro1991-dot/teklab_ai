EXCLUSIVE INNOVATION Teklab. Competitor (_TECH14__, HBControls, Emerson) requires 2 separate sensors. Advantages __TECH5_: 1) Single installation vs. 2 (50% labour saving). 2) Single loss point vs. 2 (50% risk reduction losses __TECH12_). 3) Unique Factory Calibration (superior accuracy). 4) Lower device cost (1 vs 2). Output: Digital NPN (ON/OFF level) + 4-20mA analogue (temperatures -50 to +150°C). SINGLE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET. Application: Transcritical CO2 systems where you need level monitoring + temperature Q: K25 vs Danfoss AKS 4100 + AKS T: economic comparison? A: Danfoss requires 2 separate sensors: AKS 4100 (level) + AKS T (PT1000 temperatures). K25 integrations both. SA_VING PURCHASED: Typical price 2 Danfoss sensors vs 1 __TECH5_ (check local list, typically ~200-300€ savings). SA_VING INSTALLATION: 1 hour fridge saving (2 installations vs 1) = 60-100€ labor. LOST REDUCTION: 1 hole vs 2 = -50% loss points R744 (coolant value + environmental impact). ROI: IMMEDIATE__TECH37_TE on first implant. Payback <1 installation. Application: Business case for multi-compressor CO2 projects Q: K25 output 4-20mA temperature: benefits vs PT1000? A: K25 uses analog output 4-20mA industrial standard for temperatures. Competitor (_TECH14__ AKS T) use PT1000 (resistive sensor). Benefits 4-20mA: 1) No conversion required (PLC reads mA directly). 2) Immunity electrical disturbances (loop current vs resistance). 3) Supported long wiring (max 1000m without degradation). 4) Universal PLC compatibility (standard analogue input). PT1000 requires specific converter or PLC module. K25 easier to integrate. Application: PLC integration with analog input 4-20mA standard Q: K25 temperature range -50 to +150°C: Is it sufficient for transcritical __TECH41_? A: Yes, range K25 covers fully transcritical CO2 cycle. CO2 evaporation temperatures: typically -35 to -10°C (OK). Gas temperature discharge high pressure side: typically +60 to +120°C (OK). Range -50 at +150°C has ample safety margin. Acuracy: ±0.5°C (Class A). Enough for efficiency optimization control and overheating compressor protection. Competitors have similar range (PT1000 typically -50 to +150°C). Application: Gas temperature monitoring disaster CO2 + receiver level control Q: Can K25 be used for other applications beyond CO2? A: Yes, __TECH5_ (150 bar) is also suitable for: 1) High pressure ammonium R717 (typically 40-80 __TECH39_, K25 has margin). 2) HFC high pressure (e.g. R410A high side). 3) Industrial applications non-refrigeration with need level + temperature combined (high pressure hydraulics, pneumatics). Limit: NPN output + 4-20mA fixed (no configurability as K11). Consider K25 when 2-in-1 benefit exceeds cost vs separate standard sensors. Application: Any high pressure application with dual-sensing need Q: __TECH5_ installation: do you need special power supply for 4-20mA? A: Yes, 4-20mA output requires loop power. Typically: 24V DC power supply for 4-20mA loops (standard industrial). PLC with analog input 4-20mA often provided integrated loop power (specific PLC verification). If PLC has no loop power supply, you need separated 24V DC external power supply (cost ~20-30€). Wiring: 2 wires per loop 4-20m__TECH37_ + 2 wires per NPN level + common power = total 4-5 wires (check specific electrical diagram model K25). Application: PLC integration with analog modules I/O Competitive advantages: SINGLE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET - first 2-in-1 sensor level + CO2 temperature (150 bar). No competitor offers equivalent. Save 50% installation, 50% loss points, unique factory calibration. Output 4-20mA standard (over PT1000 per integration). Absolute competitive advantage. Easy Retrofit: Easy - Single installation vs 2. Standard CO2 thread. Standard 24V DC power supply. Warning: 4-20mA loop + NPN cable is needed (4-5 total wires). .",
