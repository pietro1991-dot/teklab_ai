    "original_text": "INNOVATION TEKLAB: LC-XP - Unique Level Switch DIN at 120 bar LC-XP is the UNICO level switch on the market with DIN 43650-A connector at 120 bar for transcritical CO2. DISCOVERED NICH - all CO2 high pressure competitors (Danfoss AKS 4100, HBControls, Emerson PSL) use only M12. Teklab has identified opportunities: more widespread DIN in aftermarket EU, cheaper cables, larger stock. WHY IT IS SINGLE: M12 is US/OEM standard, DIN 43650-A is industrial EU standard. Transcritical fast-growing EU CO2 market (supermarkets, F-gas legislation), but no manufacturer offered high-pressure DIN. Teklab has filled gap: EU coolers are more familiar with DIN, DIN cables cost 50% less than M12, superior local availability. CONCRETE ADVANTAGES: • EU standard industrial DIN connector (major technical familiarity vs M12) • DIN cables 50% cheaper vs M12 (15€ vs 30€ typical) • DIN cable stock most popular spare parts in local EU distributors • IP67 holding equivalent to M12 (critical industrial environments) • 316L materials certified CO2 (EN 12263 compliant) • 120 bar pressure suitable for 95% transcritical applications: R744 transcritical CO2 systems up to 120 bar. Thread 7/16\" UNF-20 or M14x1.5 (standard CO2). DIN 43650-A industrial-grade connector. Digital output PNP/NPN. TYPE APPLICATIONS: CO2 plants EU market where DIN is an existing company standard, retrofit with DIN cables already available, stock standardization spare parts on DIN. FREQUENT QUESTIONS: Q: LC-XP DIN vs M12 competitor: equivalent quality? A: Yes, technological level sensor EQUIVALENT (both digital capacitives). DIN and M12 are both industrial standards with IP67 seal. Difference is only connector, not sensor performance. Choice based on: technical preference, available cables, existing standard plant. Q: Can I replace M12 sensor with LC-XP DIN? A: Yes, easy mechanical retrofit (same standard CO2 thread). Electric Retrofit: Needs new DIN cable (~15€, 20 min installation). Trade-off currency: Cable initial investment vs future benefits DIN (economy, availability). Recommended if: standards on DIN, you already have stock DIN cables, technicians prefer DIN. TESTIMONIANCE CUSTOMER: \"Our technicians have known DIN for 20 years, M12 less. DIN cables are always in the van. Perfect LC-XP: high pressure CO2 + familiar connector. Zero training required.\" .",
