    "original_text": "INNOVATION TEKLAB: TK4MB - Triple Interface (Relè + NFC + Modbus RTU) TK4MB is the oil level regulator with a unique INTERFACE TRIPLE: 1) Alarm relay (standalone base protection). 2) Wireless NFC (Rapid Smartphone Local Configuration). 3) Modbus RTU (centralized PLC/SCADA supervision). NO COMPETITOR offers complete combination - maximum architectural flexibility. WHY IT IS UNIQUE: Traditional oil regulators: either standalone (only relay) or bus (only Modbus/BACnet). TK4MB offers ENTRAMBI + NFC: it works standalone out-of-box (relè), configurable on-site (NFC), integrated supervision (Modbus RTU). Architect system chooses necessary integration level. Competitors require separate devices for each level. ADVANTAGES CONCRETE: • Flexibility deployment: same device for standalone, local supervision, or Centralized Industry 4.0 • SKU reduction: 1 product covers all use case (vs 3 separate models competitor) • NFC quick setup: device configuration before integration Modbus (sparmio commissioning) • Robus RTU Modbus: RS485 2 wires, max 1200m, no switch/router required (vs Modbus TCP competitor) • Multi-level diagnostics: local alarm relay, NFC for on-site diagnostics, Modbus for centralized analytics • Modbus registers exposed: real-time level, valve, alarms, rabloc cycles, remote parameter configuration: 3 pressure versions: 46/80130 bar. Modbus RTU RS485 (9600/19200/38400 bps configurable). Max 32 devices on buses. Compatible PLC: Siemens, Schneider, Allen-Bradley, Omron. SCADA: WinCC, InTouch, FactoryTalk, Ignition. TYPE APPLICATIONS: Supermarkets chains (centralized supervision + local NFC maintenance), complex industrial plants (PLC integration + on-site diagnostics), retrofit Industry 4.0 (add Modbus to existing standalone systems). FREQUENT QUESTIONS: Q: TK4MB Modbus RTU vs Danfoss Modbus TCP: Which to choose? A: Trade-off architecture. Modbus RTU (TK4MB): RS485 2 wires, robust, economical, no Ethernet infrastructure, max 1200m. Modbus TCP (Danfoss): Ethernet, fast, flexible, requires switch/router, higher cost. Choice: RTU for plants without Ethernet or where strength is critical, TCP for modern IT-integrated plants. TK4MB optimizes for industrial cost/business. Q: Can TK4MB work without Modbus as simple TK4? A: Yes, absolutely. TK4MB works standalone out-of-box (alarm relay). Modbus is optional: if you don't connect RS485, device works identical to TK4 (reel + NFC). Flexibility: install today standalone, tomorrow add Modbus if you need supervision. No need to rewire (RS485 already present). CUSTOMER WITNESS: \"We have 200 stores: some with SCADA (serve Modbus), others standalone (serve only relays). Before: we ordered 2 separate models. With TK4MB: 1 unique model, we form on-site with NFC if you need Modbus or not. Simplified stock, total flexibility.\" .",
