NO Competitor offers equivalent - total exclusive innovation. It fully eliminates the need for Rotalock adapters→NPT/SAE, multiple gaskets, intermediate fittings. WHY IT IS SINGLE: Rotalock valves are ubiquitous but no manufacturer had ever designed sensor with native attachment. All competitors require external adapters with disadvantages: material costs, installation time, additional loss points. Teklab has identified uncovered nice and created unique product. ADV_ANTAGES CONCRETE: • Installation 5 min vs 45 min with traditional adapters (saving 40 min labor = 40-70€) • Zero additional loss points: 1 connection vs 2 (reduction 50% cooling risk) • Saving materials: eliminates Rotalock adapter→NPT (~30€) + gaskets (~5€) = 35€ per installation • Connector DIN 43650-_TECH37__ electrical for quick plug-and-play maintenance • Instant ROI: payback on first installation (total savings 75-105€) Bracket: Standard Rotalock_ valves of all brands: __TECH24_, __TECH33_E_PACK_TEC_TECH26_TEC_24_TECH3_TECH14_TECH3_TECH3_TECH3_T_T_TECH34_T_TECH3_T_T_T_TECH34_TECH3_T_T_T_T_T_T_TECH34_TECH34_TECH34_T_T_T_T_T_TECH34_T_TECH34_T_T_T_TECH34_T_T_T_TECH34_T_T_T_T_T_TECH34_T_T_T_TECH34_T_T_T_T_T_T_T_TECH34_T_T_T_T_T_T_T_TECH34_T_T_TECH34 Pressure: 46 bar (standard HFC/HFO systems).TYPICAL APPLICATIONS: Liquid receivers, compressors with Rotalock valves, retrofit existing systems without extended stop. FREQUENT QUESTIONS: Q: Works with Rotalock valves of any brand? __TECH37_: Yes, Rotalock thread is international industrial standard. Compatible with all major brands (Sporlan, Castel, Parker, __TECH14_, Emerson/_TECH8__). Only check that valve has port available (typically receipts have 2-4 ports).Q: Do you need to empty system to install Rotalock Switch?A: No, Rotalock valves have built-in closure. Procedures: close Rotalock valve, remove blind cap, install switch, reopen valve. No cool emptying required. Secure pressure installation. CUSTOMER WITNESS: \"Before it took 2 technicians and 1 hour to mount sensor with adapters and leak risk. With Rotalock Switch: 1 technicalian, 5 minutes, zero losses. Game changer for urgent maintenance.\" .",
