    "original_text": "INNOVATION TEKLAB: K11 - Configurable Output Universal 3-in-1 K11 is the first capacitive level sensor with UNIBLE OUTPUT via DIP switch: single device works like NPN, PNP or AC (relay). Competitor (Danfoss AKS 33, Alco ELS, Sporlan) require order 3 separate versions. INNOVATION SMART reduces SKU 66%. WHY IT IS SINGLE: Traditional problem: you have to order specific sensor version for PLC type (NPN sink or PNP source). Common order errors, stock warehouse tripled. Teklab solved with configurable design: 1 device = 3 versions. No competitor offers configurability in standard level sensors. ADVANTAGES CONCRETE: • SKU 66% reduction: 1 product in stock instead of 3 (reduced immobilized capital) • PLC universal compatibility: works with any controller (Siemens, Allen-Bradley, Schneider, Omron, Mitsubishi) • Order error elimination: no risk ordering wrong version (reorder cost + project delay) • Retrofit flexibility: same device for any replacement, on-site configuration in 2 minutes • Universal AC output: relay option for PLC type unknown (total galvanic isolation) Standard M18x1 thread. Configuration: Accessible internal DIP switch (front screw). TYPE APPLICATIONS: Multiple customer distributors (stock reduction), retrofit installers (flexible), OEM with product variants (BOM reduction). FREQUENT QUESTIONS: Q: K11 DIP switch configuration: is it difficult? A: No, very simple. Unscrew front cover (standard screw), set DIP switch (positions 1-2 NPN, 3-4 PNP, 5-6 AC), close. Time: 2 minutes. No special tools. Mechanical configuration (maintains memory without battery). Clear instructions on datasheet. Q: Can I change K11 configuration after installation? A: Yes, infinitely editable configuration. Useful if: change PLC plant, reuse sensor on other project. Note: if already wired, check polarity before feeding with new configuration (avoid PLC damage). CUSTOMER TESTIMONY: \"I manage stock for 20 customers with different PLCs. First: 10 NPN sensors + 10 PNP + 10 AC = 30 pieces of stock. Now with K11: 30 pieces configurable = same coverage, zero risk obsolescence. Brilliant!\"",
