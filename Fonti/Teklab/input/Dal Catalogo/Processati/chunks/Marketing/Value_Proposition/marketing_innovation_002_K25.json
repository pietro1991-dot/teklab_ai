    "original_text": "INNOVATION TEKLAB: K25 - First Sensor 2-in-1 Level + Temperature CO2 K25 is the FIRST AND ONLY sensor worldwide that integrates liquid level detection + temperature measurement in single body for transcritical CO2 systems (150 bar). REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCT - all competitors (Danfoss, HBControls, Emerson, Carel) require 2 separate sensors. WHY IT IS SINGLE: Transcritical CO2 systems require simultaneous level monitoring (receiver) and temperature (efficiency optimization, overheating protection). Traditionally: 2 separate sensors = 2 installations, 2 loss points, 2 calibrations. Teklab has integrated dual-sensing in single device with unique factory calibration. No competitor has equivalent. ADVANTAGES CONCRETE: • Single installation vs 2 separated (saving 50% labour = 30-60 min = 30-60€) • Single loss point vs 2 (reduction 50% risk losses R744, coolant value + environmental impact) • Lower device cost: 1 sensor vs 2 (typical saving 200-300€ hardware) • Unique factory calibration: level + temperature calibrated together (higher accuracy) • Dual output: Digital NPN level (ON/OFF) + 4-20mA analog temperature (-50 to +150°C, ±0.5°C) • Immediate ROI: payback <1 installation: Transcritical CO2 systems R744 up to 150 bar. Temperature range: -50 to +150°C (complete cover transcritical cycle). Output: NPN + 4-20mA industrial standard. TYPE APPLICATIONS: Transcritical supermarket CO2 liquid receivers, cold storage, industrial food plants. High temperature discharge gas monitoring. Heat rejection control optimization. FREQUENT QUESTIONS: Q: Output 4-20mA temperature: do you need converter for PLC? A: No, 4-20mA is universal industrial standard. PLC with analog input modules read mA directly. Easier than PT1000 that requires converter or specific module. Advantage: immunity electrical disturbances, long supported wiring (max 1000m). Q: K25 can replace 2 existing Danfoss sensors? A: Yes, retrofit possible but currency trade-off. Advantages: reduction to 1 hole (closes extra hole), saving future maintenance. Disadvantages: if current sensors work, initial investment K25. Recommended for: new installations, retrofit with faulty sensors, projects where loss reduction is critical. CUSTOMER TESTIMONIANCE: \"First we ordered Danfoss level sensor + separate temperature sensor: 2 hours installation, 2 holes in the receiver, double cost. With K25: all integrated, 30 minutes, one hole only. And it costs less than 2 separate sensors!\"",
