EXCLUSIVE INNOV__TECH37_TION - no competitor offers NFC in this category. Premium Competition (Danfoss) have BLE Bluetooth with great complexity. TK4 revolutionizes commissioning: parameter configuration in 30 seconds via smartphone (vs 10 minutes traditional DIP switches). WHY IS UNIQUE: Oil level regulators: configuration via DIP switch/jumper requires opening electrical panel, technical manual, time. TK4 uses NFC: smartphone tap on sensor, intuitive app changes parameters (delay alarm, bouncing time, level frequency), advanced diagnostics (historical alarms, bouncing cycles). Zero additional wiring, zero cloud costs. • Intuitive iOS/_TECH37__ndroid app (zero learning curves) • _TECH37__dvanced diagnostics: historic alarms with timestamp, number of full-time loops, real-time sensor status • Configurable parameters: alarm delay 10-300 sec, pick-up time 5-120 sec, thread level 10-90% • Zero cloud costs: data saved locally in the device (no subscriptions) • ROI for installers: 10 device = 95 min saved = 1.5 hours Labour (90-150€) • Same __TECH13_ base (optical sensor, integrated valve, alarm relay) + __TECH40_ added. 3 pressure versions: 46/80/130 __TECH39_ (HFC, ammonium, __TECH41_). Smartphone requirements NFC chip (95% models since 2020).TYPICAL APPLICATIONS: Large multi-compressor projects (saving commissioning), fast field maintenance (instant diagnostics), retail chains (standardized fast configuration).FREQUENT QUESTIONS: Q: TK4 NFC vs Danfoss BLE: Which is better? A: Different Trade-off. NFC: range <5cm (direct sensor tap), no pairing, instant, also works off device, maximum safety (impossible to intercept). BLE: range ~10m (distance monitoring), requires pairing, device must be switched on. Choice: NFC for fast on-site secure configuration, BLE for remote monitoring. TK4 optimizes for simplicity/security. Q: TK4 NFC app requires internet/cloud? __TECH37_: No, app works 100% offline. Data stored locally in the TK4 device (non-volatile memory). App reads/writes via NFC direct. Zero cloud dependence, zero subscriptions, zero connectivity problems. Total privacy (data never as out of device). App updates via standard store (iOS/_TECH37__ndroid). CUSTOMER WITNESS: \"I run 50 supermarkets, each store has 4 compressors. Before: 200 oil regulars to configure = 2000 minutes (33 hours!). With TK4 NFC: 200 devices × 30 sec = 100 minutes. Savings 31 hours = 2000€ Labour. Investment paid immediately.\" .",
