                "answer": "K11 level switches use infrared technology for their operation. They have a sensor dome made of glass and an optical receiver. In air (liquid not present), all the light emitted is reflected – internally – by the dome and then redirected to the receiver. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a big amount of the light emitted is lost in the liquid and the sensor senses its presence.",
