                "question": "How does the electronic sensor in LC-PS work?",
                "answer": "The electronic sensor in LC-PS uses an infrared-ray emitter and optical receiver to detect the presence of liquid. When the liquid reaches the sensor dome, a significant amount of light is lost, allowing the sensor to accurately detect the liquid level. This technology ensures reliable readings even in low-light environments. The electronic sensor can be easily replaced without emptying or depressurizing the plant, making maintenance and repair straightforward.",
