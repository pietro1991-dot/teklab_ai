Additionally, the product features a compact design and reduced junctions for improved reliability. The left/right mounting possibility with the same TK3+ reduces the number of junctions in the circuit, minimizing the risk of leakages. Furthermore, the use of less components simplifies the circuit and makes warehouse management easier. Installation is also simplified, resulting in cost savings.",

This eliminates the risk of wear and tear, which can lead to system failures. Additionally, the product features a sight glass and electronic LEDs that can be checked on the same side, making inspections more comfortable and efficient. The well-consolidated steel with fused glass technology and absence of seals ensures no leakage and good chemical compatibility. Furthermore, the direct sight glass replacement option simplifies maintenance and reduces downtime. Overall, the TK3+ 130bar CO2 oil level controller is designed to provide reliable operation in high-pressure applications.",
